{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances of powershell.exe commands. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe. The triggers are set to AtLogon, and the principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest. That's a red flag because creating scheduled tasks with admin rights and high privileges can be malicious. \n\nWait, calc.exe is a legitimate Windows utility, but in this context, it's being used as the action for a scheduled task. However, the fact that it's being registered with such elevated permissions might be suspicious. Also, the task names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc., seem arbitrary, which might indicate they're generated by an attacker.\n\nThere are multiple entries of Register-ScheduledTask with different names, which could be an attempt to create multiple tasks. The repetition of the same command structure across different events suggests a pattern, possibly part of an automated attack.\n\nAdditionally, there are events related to registry value sets and process accesses, which could be part of the attack's footprint. The ImageLoad events show loading of mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are .NET components. While they're legitimate, their loading in conjunction with the other events might be part of a larger malicious activity, like using .NET to execute code.\n\nHowever, there's also a chrome.exe event related to a pipe created, which might be normal user activity. But the majority of the logs are about PowerShell creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges. \n\nConsidering all these points, the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with high privileges and the use of PowerShell to do so are strong indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though calc.exe is benign, the method and context here are suspicious. The confidence level is high because these actions are consistent with privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges (RunLevel Highest) for BUILTIN\\\\Administrators, executing calc.exe at logon. This pattern suggests potential malicious activity attempting to establish persistence or escalate privileges.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. The winlog tasks mention Image loaded, which is normal, but the files involved are system files like mscorlib.ni.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, those are part of the .NET framework and Windows Defender. So maybe that's just normal operation. But then there's a File created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag, especially if it's a script file. The file name has __PSScriptPolicyTest, which might be a legitimate test, but the fact that it's created and deleted quickly could be an attempt to hide something.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event. Not sure if that's harmful on its own. Then, looking at the command_line entries for powershell.exe, there's a script that's creating a scheduled task with calc.exe, which is a common example for testing. But the user here is setting up a scheduled task with high privileges (RunLevel Highest) and targeting Administrators group. That's a bit concerning because it's giving elevated permissions. The task is named \"estrutura_auxiliar$object\" which seems random or maybe obfuscated. Another similar command_line entry later creates another task named \"unidade_comum$object\". These names don't look standard, which might indicate malicious intent.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with \"Execute a Remote Command\" from process None. That's odd because the process field is empty. Maybe the logs are incomplete or there's a failure in capturing the process. But having multiple remote command executions could be a sign of a potential attack, especially if it's coming from unknown sources.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are all about registry value sets. If this is a legitimate application, maybe it's updating settings, but repeated registry changes could be part of a configuration or a malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But since there are so many chrome.exe events, maybe it's just normal usage, but I need to check if they are all the same or different.\n\nPutting it all together: the powershell.exe activities involve creating scheduled tasks with high privileges, which could be a way to maintain persistence. The temporary file creation and deletion might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. The \"Execute a Remote Command\" events could indicate that someone is trying to run commands remotely, which is a clear red flag. Even though some events might be benign, the combination of scheduled tasks with elevated rights, possible script execution, and remote commands makes this batch suspicious. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be normal, but the overall pattern points towards something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including scheduled task creation with high privileges, temporary script file creation\/deletion, and potential remote command execution attempts. These patterns suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: WmiPrvSE.exe loaded taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate process, but sometimes malware uses WMI for persistence. However, taskschd.dll is a system file, so maybe that's normal. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services. Setting registry values could be normal, but if it's done repeatedly, maybe something's wrong. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother event shows svchost.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. Wait, the System32\\Tasks directory is where scheduled tasks are stored. Creating a new task there might be suspicious, especially if it's a file named \"unidade_comum\" which doesn't look like a standard task name. That could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's an entry with process None executing a remote command. That's odd. If the process field is None, maybe it's a system event without an associated process. But executing a remote command without a clear process might indicate something malicious, like a remote code execution attempt.\n\nNext, powershell.exe creates a file in the user's AppData directory. That's common for legitimate scripts, but sometimes malware uses PowerShell for persistence. However, the file name StartupProfileData-NonInteractive sounds like a normal PowerShell profile file. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother PowerShell event sets a registry value. Again, could be normal or malicious. The chrome.exe entries are mostly registry changes and DNS queries. Chrome is a common target for attacks, but the events here don't immediately look malicious. The DNS query might be normal browsing.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe events are creating files in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be part of its normal operation, like configuration updates. But the user might have downloaded and installed it, so that's likely benign.\n\nThe entry with process None again executing a remote command is concerning. If there's no process associated, maybe it's a system-level event or a potential indicator of a vulnerability being exploited.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious points are the svchost.exe creating a file in the Tasks directory, the process None executing a remote command, and multiple registry changes. However, some of these could be normal system activity. The presence of a file in the Tasks directory might indicate a scheduled task being created, which could be malicious. The remote command execution without a process is a red flag. But without more context, like the content of the files or the specific registry changes, it's hard to be certain. However, the combination of these events does warrant further investigation. So I would classify this as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows System32\\\\Tasks directory (potential malicious task creation), process 'None' executing a remote command (unusual), and repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe and svchost.exe (could indicate persistence attempts).\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
