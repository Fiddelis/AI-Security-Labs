So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are about chrome.exe making network connections. That's normal, right? Browsers connect to the internet all the time. But there are several entries for powershell.exe doing various things. Let's check those.\n\nThere's a registry value set by powershell, which might be normal, but then there are image loads. The files loaded are .dlls from Microsoft.NET and Windows Defender. That seems legitimate, but then there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's suspicious. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of an attack, like dropping a payload and then cleaning up.\n\nThen there are several instances of powershell.exe starting processes with long, obfuscated paths. The command lines have paths with \"..\\\" which might be trying to hide the actual location. The filenames are generic like \"modulo_logico_script.bat\" which doesn't seem suspicious on its own, but combined with the obfuscation and the fact that they're being started from PowerShell, it raises a red flag.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple process access events and registry changes might indicate that PowerShell is being used for something beyond normal operations. The fact that the same pattern repeats multiple times with different paths suggests automation or a script that's trying to execute various commands, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\nEven though some of the files are from legitimate sources like Windows Defender, the overall pattern of creating temporary files, obfuscated paths, and multiple process starts is concerning. The combination of these events could indicate a potential security threat, like a script trying to execute malicious code or bypass security measures.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch has several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. The confidence is high because the combination of events is not typical of normal user behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing obfuscated command-line scripts with suspicious file paths, creating and deleting temporary files, and loading .NET assemblies, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve chrome.exe performing registry value sets. That's a lot of entries. But chrome.exe is a common browser, and it's possible that it interacts with the registry normally. However, the sheer number of registry changes might be suspicious. But I should check if there's anything else.\n\nLooking further, there's an entry where powershell.exe loads urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but sometimes malicious software might use it. However, just loading it might not be enough. Then, there's a cmd.exe process running a script from \"C:\\entrada_ativo\\estrutura_principal\\entrada_geral_script.bat\". The path here seems a bit odd. The folder names are in Portuguese, like \"entrada_ativo\" which translates to \"input active\" or something similar. That might be a red flag, especially if the script is executing from a non-standard location. \n\nAnother point is the creation of a file by powershell.exe at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\componente_principal.txt\". While creating a file isn't inherently bad, if the file contains malicious content or if it's part of a larger pattern, that could be concerning. However, just creating a text file might not be enough on its own.\n\nAlso, there's a file created by svchost.exe in the DeliveryOptimization directory. That's part of Windows Update, so that's probably legitimate. But I should check if the file paths are normal. The keyValueLKG.dat seems like a normal state file for Delivery Optimization.\n\nAnother thing is the image loaded by chrome.exe, which includes amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate files related to Windows Defender. So that's probably normal behavior.\n\nBut the main suspicious part is the cmd.exe executing that script from a non-standard path. The presence of multiple registry changes by chrome.exe might be normal, but combined with the script execution, it could indicate something. However, I need to see if there's any other suspicious activity. The powershell.exe also creates a file in the user's Downloads folder, which is common, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut considering that there's a script execution from a path that's not typical (maybe a custom or non-system directory), that might be worth investigating. Also, the multiple registry changes by chrome.exe could be part of a larger attack, like modifying registry keys to persist or change behavior. However, without seeing the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to say. But the combination of the script execution and multiple registry events might be enough to flag this as interesting.\n\nSo, the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.65. The justification is the combination of the script execution from a non-standard path and multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe combined with execution of a script from a non-standard path (C:\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\...\\\\entrada_geral_script.bat) suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each line.\n\nFirst, there are four entries where the process is chrome.exe, and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". The file is None here. Then there's another entry with winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory, and another with powershell.exe creating a text file.\n\nHmm, chrome.exe modifying the registry... That's a bit unusual because Chrome is a browser, and changing registry values might be part of its normal operations, but maybe not. However, if it's happening multiple times, maybe that's suspicious. But wait, the same event is repeated four times. Could that be a normal activity, or is it an indicator of something else? Like, maybe a malicious script is modifying the registry through Chrome?\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its setup. But the path is in the Downloads folder, which might not be standard. Usually, software would install to Program Files or something else. But maybe the user manually downloaded and extracted it, so that's possible.\n\nThe powershell.exe entry creating elemento_base.txt. PowerShell is a common tool, and creating a text file isn't necessarily bad. But again, the context matters. If there are other suspicious activities around it, maybe. But on its own, it's not a red flag.\n\nNow, combining all these. The repeated registry changes by chrome.exe might be worth looking into. However, if those are legitimate, like Chrome updating its settings, then they're not malicious. But if they're part of a larger attack, like persistence mechanisms, then they are. The other events are more benign. But the fact that there are multiple registry changes by Chrome could be a sign of something. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit low because the events are not clearly malicious. The presence of winlogbeat and PowerShell creating files might be normal user activities. The Chrome events could be normal, but their repetition might indicate something. But I'm not sure. So maybe the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence because there's some unusual activity that might need further investigation, but not enough to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe instances modifying registry values repeatedly, which is unusual for a browser. Additionally, winlogbeat and powershell creating files in user directories may indicate potential configuration changes or data manipulation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
