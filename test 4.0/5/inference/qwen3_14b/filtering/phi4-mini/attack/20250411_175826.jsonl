{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there are several entries for chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. Then there's whoami.exe, which is a legitimate tool to check user identity. But then there's a lot of activity around powershell.exe. \n\nLooking at the command lines for powershell, there's a pattern where they're modifying the LastWriteTime of files to a specific date, 01\/01\/1970. That's the Unix epoch, which is often used in hacking to indicate tampering or to hide files. Also, there are multiple instances of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks, which could be normal, but combined with the file timestamp changes, it might be suspicious.\n\nThe ImageLoad events mention loading clr.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. That's normal, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, maybe. Then there's a FileCreate and FileDelete for a temporary script file. Creating and deleting a script could be part of an attack, especially if the script is malicious.\n\nAlso, the PipeEvent might be normal, but combined with other activities, it's worth noting. The RuntimeBroker.exe modifying the registry might be okay, but again, depends on context. However, the repeated use of PowerShell to alter timestamps and create\/delete files in temporary directories is a red flag. That behavior is often seen in malware trying to cover its tracks by changing timestamps and executing scripts.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the presence of multiple PowerShell commands modifying file timestamps, creating and deleting scripts, along with registry and process access events, suggests potential malicious activity. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination and the specific actions taken (like timestamp changes) are indicative of something suspicious. Therefore, this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are modifying file timestamps to 01\/01\/1970 (Unix epoch), a common tactic to hide malicious activity. This is combined with file creation\/deletion in temporary directories and registry modifications, suggesting potential tampering or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are several PowerShell commands that modify the LastWriteTime of files to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\". That date is significant because it's the Unix epoch, often used to reset timestamps. Why would someone do that? Maybe to hide the actual time a file was modified, which could be part of an attempt to cover tracks after tampering with files. The paths mentioned are a mix of different directories, but the pattern of changing timestamps is consistent.\n\nThen there are entries about svchost.exe and other legitimate processes like Calculator.exe and chrome.exe. Those seem normal. However, the multiple PowerShell events with the same command structure are a red flag. The use of Get-ChildItem followed by setting the LastWriteTime to a specific date is a common technique in malware to alter file metadata, making it harder to detect changes.\n\nAlso, there's a File created event for a PowerShell startup profile, which might be normal, but combined with the other events, it could indicate someone setting up persistence. The winlogbeat.exe event is about a file being created, which might be part of a log collection tool, but not necessarily malicious here.\n\nHowever, the main concern here is the repeated use of PowerShell to alter file timestamps. This behavior is not typical of normal user activity. It's more indicative of an attacker trying to manipulate the system's file metadata to avoid detection. Even though there are no direct signs of malware execution or network activity, the combination of these events raises suspicion. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of malicious files or commands, but the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are modifying file LastWriteTime attributes to a Unix epoch timestamp (01\/01\/1970), a technique often used to obscure file modification times during malicious activity. The pattern of file path traversal (e.g., '..\\\\') and repeated timestamp manipulation across different directories suggests potential data tampering or evasion attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. So, the first event is about chrome.exe loading amsi.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows' Anti-Malware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process like chrome.exe is loading it, that might be normal. But I should check if there's any suspicious activity here.\n\nThen there are multiple entries where chrome.exe sets registry values. A lot of them, like six times. That seems unusual. Why would chrome.exe be modifying the registry so many times? Maybe it's part of a normal update or configuration, but repeated registry changes could indicate something malicious, like changing settings to persist or evade detection.\n\nAnother event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. The file path seems to be a temporary .new file, which could be part of a normal setup process. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe creating a text file named \"unidade_logico.txt\". That might be a log file or some output from a script. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, if this is the only instance, it might not be a big red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious points are the multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe. Legitimate processes don't usually modify the registry that frequently. Also, the amsi.dll load might be normal, but combined with the registry changes, it could be part of a larger pattern. However, there's not enough evidence here to confirm malicious activity. Maybe the user is just using chrome in a way that triggers these events. But since there are multiple registry events, it's worth investigating further. So, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6. The justification is the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe, which is unusual and could indicate malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events by chrome.exe (6 instances) combined with amsi.dll loading may indicate suspicious behavior, though not definitively malicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
