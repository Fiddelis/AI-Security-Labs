{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe doing DNS queries, MpDefenderCoreService.exe having network connections, and chrome.exe doing similar things. Those seem normal. Browsers and system services often perform DNS lookups and network connections. Not immediately worrying.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe appearing multiple times. PowerShell is common, but when combined with certain commands, it can be a red flag. Let me check the command lines. Oh, there's a cmd.exe instance with a command that adds a user to the domain with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and adds them to the Domain Admins group. That's a big red flag. Creating domain admin accounts is a serious security issue. Also, the usernames and passwords look like they might be temporary or test credentials, which is suspicious.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command adds another user, \"unidade_comum_Admin\" with a password, and adds them to Domain Admins again. That's repeated multiple times. Also, there's a net1.exe which seems to be a typo or a malicious version of net.exe, possibly used for adding users. The presence of net1.exe instead of the standard net.exe could indicate a malicious tool.\n\nThere's also a file created by powershell.exe at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\pacote_base.txt. Not sure what that file contains, but the name might be innocuous. However, the other file creations by svchost.exe are in system directories (SRUtmp.log), which is normal for system processes, so those might be benign.\n\nThe key suspicious activities are the multiple instances of adding users to the Domain Admins group with potentially weak or temporary passwords, and the use of net1.exe which might be a malicious binary. These actions suggest someone is trying to escalate privileges or set up access for unauthorized users. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these commands and the creation of admin accounts is highly suspicious and warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin accounts with weak passwords (e.g., 'registro_temporario_pass123!'), use of net1.exe (likely a malicious variant of net.exe), and repeated attempts to add users to Domain Admins group. These indicate potential privilege escalation or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these three events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by breaking down each event.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe is creating a file at a specific path. The file is a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if someone is setting up winlogbeat, but sometimes attackers use similar filenames to hide malicious configs. However, just creating a file isn't necessarily bad.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe is setting a registry value. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Setting a registry value could be part of a normal configuration or something more nefarious like persistence mechanisms. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe is accessing a process. Process access could be part of a legitimate operation, like checking system status, or it could be a sign of process injection or other attacks. Again, need more info.\n\nLooking at the combination: All events involve PowerShell and winlogbeat. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for logging, but if it's being used in conjunction with PowerShell activities that are suspicious, that might be a red flag. However, the events alone don't show clear malicious intent. The file creation is in the Downloads directory, which is common for user activities. The registry and process access events don't have details about what was changed or which processes were accessed. Without additional indicators like unusual command-line arguments, unexpected network activity, or other anomalies, it's hard to classify this as definitely interesting. But the presence of multiple PowerShell events alongside winlogbeat might warrant further investigation. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence since there's some unusual activity that isn't clearly benign.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities alongside winlogbeat file creation in user Downloads directory may indicate configuration changes or potential misuse of legitimate tools.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
