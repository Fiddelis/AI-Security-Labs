{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a lot of activity around powershell.exe. Processes being accessed, created, and images loaded. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The fifth event stands out because it has a command line that creates a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to a file in \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\". That path doesn't look standard. Usually, malicious files are in temporary directories or user-specific paths, not in a \"unidade_logico\" folder. Also, creating a new service with PowerShell might be a red flag.\n\nThen, looking at the image loads: there are several .dll files being loaded, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. While some of these are legitimate, the presence of multiple image loads could indicate that the process is doing more than usual. However, the most concerning part is the creation of the new service. Services are typically managed through proper installation procedures, so using PowerShell to create one might be part of an attack.\n\nAnother point is the deletion of a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1). Deleting temporary files isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of covering tracks, that's suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe events involving services.exe modifying the registry multiple times could be normal, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it might indicate that the service is being configured in an unusual way. However, the key event here is the creation of the \"objeto_ativo\" service with a non-standard binary path. That seems like a high-risk activity, possibly indicating the installation of a backdoor or malicious service.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch does show suspicious activity, especially the creation of a new service with a non-standard path. Even though some events are normal (like loading .NET DLLs), the combination of PowerShell commands creating a service and modifying the registry points to potential malicious behavior. Therefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.85 because the evidence is strong but not definitive without further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating a new service named 'objeto_ativo' with a non-standard binary path (C:\\\\unidade_logico...\\\\tarefa_logico.exe), which is highly suspicious.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. The first two entries are about the process 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading images from .NET Framework DLLs. That seems normal because those are standard system files. Then there's a PowerShell process creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for temporary files, but maybe not suspicious yet.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' are setting registry values. A lot of registry changes could be normal, but if there are many of them, especially from system processes, it might indicate something's wrong. However, these processes are part of Windows services and might legitimately modify the registry during normal operations.\n\nThen there's a file created by 'MsMpEng.exe', which is part of Windows Defender. That's expected. The last entry is another registry change by 'svchost.exe'. But looking at the repetition, there are 24 entries for svchost.exe registry events. That's a lot. Normally, svchost.exe hosts various services, and some registry changes are normal, but an excessive number might suggest a malicious process trying to inject code or modify settings. However, without more context like unexpected registry keys or unusual parameters, it's hard to tell. The PowerShell event creating a file in StartupProfileData might be normal too, but sometimes attackers use that for persistence.\n\nPutting it all together, the majority of events are from legitimate system processes. The high number of registry changes by svchost.exe could be a red flag, but without more suspicious indicators (like unexpected paths or commands), it's not conclusive.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of svchost.exe and setup.exe activities. The svchost.exe is a normal Windows process that hosts various system services, so seeing it multiple times might be routine. However, the setup.exe is creating several files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. The files include msedge.exe, notification_helper.exe, and others. Now, setup.exe is typically associated with installation processes, so creating these files could be part of a legitimate software installation, like updating Edge. But I should check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nWait, the paths mentioned are under Program Files (x86) for Microsoft EdgeCore. That seems like a legitimate location for Microsoft Edge components. However, the presence of a batch file named show_third_party_software_licenses.bat might be a red flag. Batch files can be used for malicious purposes, but they can also be part of legitimate software. However, the fact that setup.exe is creating multiple executable files and a batch file in that directory might indicate an installation or update. But why is setup.exe involved here? Setup.exe is usually part of an installer, so maybe this is a legitimate installation of Edge. However, there's also a lot of registry events from svchost.exe and services.exe. Registry modifications can be normal, but excessive or unusual changes might be a sign of something malicious.\n\nBut looking at the events, all the registry tasks are from svchost.exe and services.exe, which are normal system processes. The setup.exe is creating files, which could be part of a legitimate installation. However, the repetition of svchost.exe events might be normal as well. But the combination of multiple file creations by setup.exe and registry changes by svchost.exe could be part of a larger process. However, without more context, like if these events are part of a known good installation or if there are other anomalies, it's hard to tell. \n\nBut considering that setup.exe is creating multiple executable files in a Microsoft directory, and given that setup.exe is a common installer, this might be a legitimate software deployment. However, the presence of a batch file might be suspicious if it's not expected. Alternatively, if this is part of a legitimate Edge update, then it's normal. But since there's no indication of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unusual process behaviors, or other security events, maybe this isn't suspicious. However, the fact that setup.exe is creating multiple files and registry changes are happening might be part of a legitimate process. \n\nAlternatively, if setup.exe is being used to install something that's not supposed to be there, but without more information, it's hard to say. The classification here depends on whether the activities are out of the ordinary. Since the files are in a Microsoft directory and the processes involved are typical system processes, maybe this isn't interesting. However, the repetition of events might be normal. \n\nBut the user wants to know if it's interesting. Since the setup.exe is creating files in a legitimate path and the registry changes are from normal processes, maybe this isn't suspicious. However, the batch file might be a red flag. But without more context, I can't be sure. The confidence here would be moderate. Maybe the justification is that setup.exe is creating multiple files in a legitimate directory, but the batch file could be suspicious. However, without more data, it's not conclusive. But the answer might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities seem to align with a legitimate software installation, even though there are some elements that could be concerning. However, I need to check again. The setup.exe is creating files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory, which is part of Edge. So this is likely a legitimate update. The batch file might be part of the installer's process. Therefore, the events don't indicate malicious activity, so the classification is not interesting. But I should check if there are any other signs. The registry events from svchost.exe and services.exe are normal. So overall, it's probably not interesting. But the presence of the batch file might be a minor concern, but not enough to flag it as suspicious. So the answer would be NOT INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe events involve **`setup.exe`** creating multiple files (e.g., `msedge.exe`, `notification_helper.exe`, and a batch file) in the `Microsoft EdgeCore` directory, which is a legitimate location for Microsoft Edge components. These activities align with a **software installation\/update process**, likely for Edge.  \n\n**Registry modifications** by **`svchost.exe`** and **`services.exe`** are typical for system processes and do not indicate malicious behavior. The batch file (`show_third_party_software_licenses.bat`) could be part of a legitimate installer's workflow, though it warrants cautious monitoring.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe activities appear to be **part of a legitimate software installation\/update**, with no clear signs of malicious intent. While the batch file raises minor curiosity, the overall context suggests normal system behavior.  \n\n**Classification:** `NOT INTERESTING`  \n**Confidence:** Moderate (activities align with known legitimate processes, but the batch file could merit further scrutiny in isolation)."}

So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the entries, most of them involve 'setup.exe' performing various registry operations and file creations. There are multiple instances where 'setup.exe' is setting registry values and creating files. One of the files created is 'msedge_proxy.exe' in the Program Files directory, which might be suspicious because that's a common location for legitimate software, but sometimes malware also uses such paths. Also, there's a 'Microsoft Edge.lnk' shortcut created in the Start Menu, which could be part of a legitimate installation, but again, could be a red flag if it's part of an unauthorized setup.\n\nThen there are several entries with 'svchost.exe' creating temporary files in the Windows Temp directory. That's normal behavior for svchost, which hosts various system services. However, creating multiple APPX temporary files might be part of a Windows Update or app installation, but it's worth checking if there's an unusual number or if they're associated with unexpected processes.\n\nThe 'setup.exe' is also creating named pipes, which are used for inter-process communication. While that's normal, excessive or unusual pipe creation could indicate malicious activity, like a backdoor or communication with another process.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events: 'setup.exe' is making a lot of changes to the registry and creating files. The presence of 'msedge_proxy.exe' might be related to a legitimate Microsoft Edge update, but if this setup isn't part of an authorized installation, it could be a concern. Also, the multiple registry modifications by 'setup.exe' could be an attempt to persist or modify system settings, which is a common tactic for malware.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events could be part of a legitimate software installation or update. But the high number of registry changes and file creations by 'setup.exe' without clear context might warrant further investigation. The confidence here is moderate because while the activities are not inherently malicious, the pattern is suspicious enough to be worth looking into.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creations by 'setup.exe', including a potential malicious proxy executable (msedge_proxy.exe) and numerous temporary files in Windows Temp directory, suggest possible unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. First, I'll go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances of svchost.exe creating files in the Windows Temp directory and in the AppReadiness folder. The paths like C:\\Windows\\Temp\\APPX.716hhqe4eer4y1ayrdv5vyhhf.tmp and the AppReadiness directory with SIDs might be suspicious. Typically, svchost.exe is a legitimate system process, but creating files in Temp is common. However, the AppReadiness folder is usually for system readiness, so files there might be unusual. However, some of these paths are repeated, maybe part of normal system operations?\n\nThen there are several registry value set events by svchost.exe. Changing registry values can be a red flag, especially if done by svchost, which is a host process for various system services. But again, if it's part of normal service operations, it might not be malicious. However, the repetition of these events might indicate something more.\n\nThen there's a RuntimeBroker.exe creating a registry value. RuntimeBroker is associated with UWP apps, so maybe that's normal. But combined with other events?\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that's executing a simple Write-Host command. That seems benign. But then there are image load events for .NET DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. Those are standard for PowerShell, so that's normal. However, the creation of a file in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_2bdqlimh.dpa.psm1 might be part of a script test. But why is that a concern?\n\nWait, the PowerShell process is using the Restricted execution policy, which is the default. The command is just writing a host message. That doesn't seem malicious. But the presence of the file creation in Temp might be part of a test, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nNow, looking at the overall pattern: multiple file creations by svchost.exe in system directories, registry changes, and a PowerShell process that's seemingly benign. However, the combination of svchost creating files in AppReadiness and the registry events might be more concerning. Also, the repetition of events might indicate automated behavior.\n\nBut I need to check if any of these are known malicious patterns. For example, creating files in AppReadiness with SIDs might be related to privilege escalation or impersonation. Also, registry modifications by svchost could be part of a persistence mechanism. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The PowerShell events seem normal, but the presence of the script policy test file could be part of a legitimate test or a malicious script trying to bypass policies.\n\nConsidering that svchost.exe is often used by malware to hide its activities, the multiple file creations and registry changes might be suspicious. However, without additional indicators like unusual network activity or unexpected process behavior, it's a bit ambiguous. The PowerShell events don't show obvious malicious intent, but the combination of system process anomalies might warrant further investigation.\n\nSo, I think this is interesting enough to flag for further analysis. The system processes behaving in ways that are not typical, even if not definitively malicious, could indicate a potential threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits a mix of normal system behavior and potential indicators of suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **svchost.exe File Creations:**\n   - **Paths:** Multiple files created in `C:\\Windows\\Temp` and `C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness` (e.g., `APPX.716hhqe4eer4y1ayrdv5vyhhf.tmp`, SIDs in filenames).\n   - **Context:** While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate system process, creating files in `AppReadiness` (typically used for system readiness tasks) and using SIDs in filenames may indicate **abnormal behavior**. This could hint at **privilege escalation** or **malicious impersonation**.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **svchost.exe** and **RuntimeBroker.exe** repeatedly modify registry values. \n   - **Risk:** Unusual registry changes by system processes may indicate **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying startup keys) or **tampering with system configurations**.\n\n3. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - A **benign** `Write-Host` command is executed under `Restricted` execution policy, but the creation of a file named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_2bdqlimh.dpa.psm1` in `C:\\Windows\\Temp` raises questions. \n   - **Potential Red Flag:** The filename suggests a **script policy test**, which could be part of a **malicious script attempting to bypass execution policies** or **probe system defenses**.\n\n4. **Image Load Events:**\n   - PowerShell loading standard .NET DLLs (`mscoreei.dll`, `clr.dll`) is **normal**, but the presence of a **custom script file** in Temp may be **suspicious** if not expected.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** While individual events (e.g., PowerShell script execution) are not inherently malicious, the **combination** of:\n  - Unusual file creation by `svchost.exe` in system directories.\n  - Repetitive registry modifications by system processes.\n  - A PowerShell script file in Temp (possibly related to policy testing or evasion).\n  - **Lack of clear benign context** for these activities.\n- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** The behavior aligns with **malware persistence techniques** (e.g., using `svchost` for stealth) and **script-based attacks** (e.g., probing execution policies).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Additional Data:**\n   - Check for **network activity** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains).\n   - Analyze **file hashes** of created files (e.g., `APPX.716hhqe4eer4y1ayrdv5vyhhf.tmp`, `__PSScriptPolicyTest_2bdqlimh.dpa.psm1`) to identify known malicious payloads.\n   - Review **system logs** for other anomalies (e.g., failed authentications, unexpected service startups).\n\n2. **Investigate Registry Changes:**\n   - Identify the **specific registry keys** modified by `svchost.exe` and `RuntimeBroker.exe` to determine if they relate to **persistence** (e.g., `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`).\n\n3. **Monitor PowerShell Usage:**\n   - Investigate the **origin** of the `__PSScriptPolicyTest_2bdqlimh.dpa.psm1` file (e.g., was it downloaded from the internet?).\n   - Check for **unauthorized script execution** or **misconfigured execution policies**.\n\n4. **Threat Intelligence Check:**\n   - Use threat intelligence platforms (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX) to analyze file hashes and network artifacts for **malware associations**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **potentially malicious** due to the **anomalous behavior of system processes** and the **suspicious script file**. While not definitively harmful, this warrants **further investigation** to rule out **malware persistence, privilege escalation, or script-based attacks**."}

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each entry. The first event is 'whoami.exe' being executed, which is a normal command to get user info. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's several 'powershell.exe' processes. PowerShell is common, but the command line in one of them stands out. The command is checking INF files for certain patterns, which might be looking for something related to driver installations or system configurations. The regex they're using matches sections like [defaultinstall.nt...], which could be part of an installation script. But is that malicious? Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there are multiple 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some are standard, like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET runtime. Others like MpClient.dll are from Windows Defender. That might be normal, but I'll note it.\n\nThen there's a 'cmd.exe' process running a Dism command to disable Windows Defender. That's a red flag. Disabling security features is a common tactic in attacks. The command line shows '\/Disable-Feature \/FeatureName:Windows-Defender \/Remove', which would remove Defender. That's definitely suspicious.\n\nAnother event is Dism.exe creating executable files in the user's Temp directory. Those DLLs (AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, etc.) being detected as executable might be part of a malicious payload. The fact that Dism is being used here is odd because Dism is typically for deployment, not for loading arbitrary executables. \n\nPutting this all together: The use of Dism to disable Windows Defender and create executable files in Temp suggests an attempt to compromise the system by removing defenses. The PowerShell script checking INF files might be part of a larger attack, maybe trying to modify system configurations or install something. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any legitimate reason for these actions. Maybe the user is doing a system cleanup or testing. But the combination of disabling Defender and creating executables in Temp is highly suspicious. The confidence here is high because disabling security features and creating executables in temporary directories are common indicators of compromise. \n\nI think the classification should be 'INTERESTING' with high confidence.

But Dism.exe is known to create and use various DLLs during its operations, especially during system image deployment or repair. The presence of multiple DLLs and MUI files in the Temp folder might be part of a legitimate process, like a system update or a repair operation initiated by the user or the system itself.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any suspicious pattern.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. All of them are related to the Dism.exe process, which I know is part of the Windows Deployment Imaging Service and Management Technology. The winlog task is \"File Executable Detected\" under the rule FileExecutableDetected. Each event has a file path in the user's Temp directory, specifically under a folder with a long GUID-like name. The files are .mui and .dll files, which are typically language-specific resources or dynamic link libraries.\n\nNow, Dism.exe is a legitimate tool used for deploying and managing Windows images. However, the fact that multiple files are being detected as executable in the Temp directory might be suspicious. The Temp directory is a common place for malware to drop files, but since Dism is involved, maybe these are part of a legitimate process. However, the repeated detection of multiple files under a single GUID folder could indicate that something is trying to execute a lot of files, which might not be normal for Dism's usual operations. \n\nWait, but looking at the file names, they are all .mui files, which are usually language packs. However, the last entry is FfuProvider.dll, which might be related to firmware updates. But why would Dism be executing so many .mui files? That doesn't seem right. Also, the fact that all these files are in the same Temp folder under a specific GUID might suggest that they were part of a package extraction or deployment. However, Dism typically works with .wim and .esd files, not .mui. \n\nAnother angle: the rule is FileExecutableDetected, which might be a custom rule or part of a security product. If the system is flagging these as executable, maybe they shouldn't be. But .mui files are not meant to be executable. That could be a red flag. If the security system is detecting these as executables, it might be an error, or maybe the files are actually malicious. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this is part of a legitimate operation where Dism is processing these files, but that seems unlikely. The presence of so many files in the Temp directory under a single session might be part of a larger process, but I'm not sure. However, given that all these files are being flagged as executable, and they're in the Temp directory, this could be a sign of malicious activity. \n\nBut I need to be careful. Maybe the user is running a legitimate deployment task that involves these files. However, the fact that they're all in the Temp folder and under a single GUID suggests that they might be part of a temporary extraction. But again, Dism's typical use cases don't involve so many .mui files. \n\nAnother thought: the GUID folder could be part of a package that's being unpacked. However, the .mui files are usually part of language packs, which are not typically executed. So if the system is detecting these as executable, that might be an error. Alternatively, the security software might be misclassifying them. \n\nBut given that all these events are from the same process (Dism.exe) and the same directory structure, it's possible that this is a legitimate operation, but the detection might be a false positive. However, since the user is asking whether this is suspicious, I should consider that. \n\nIn conclusion, while Dism.exe is a legitimate process, the detection of multiple .mui and .dll files in the Temp directory being flagged as executable might be unusual. This could be a sign of either a false positive or a potential malicious activity. It would be worth investigating further, such as checking the files' hashes, verifying their digital signatures, and ensuring that the Dism process is indeed legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the **`Dism.exe`** process detecting multiple files in the **`Temp`** directory as executable. While `Dism.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool used for imaging and deployment, the context here raises several red flags:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **File Types and Locations**:\n   - The files are `.mui` (language resource files) and `.dll` (dynamic link libraries), which are **not typically executed** directly by `Dism.exe`. `.mui` files are usually read-only and not executable.\n   - All files are located in a **temporary directory** (`%TEMP%`) under a folder with a GUID-like name (e.g., `33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-C896BFE96B`), suggesting a temporary extraction or deployment operation.\n\n2. **Rule Triggered**:\n   - The **\"File Executable Detected\"** rule (likely from an endpoint detection tool) indicates that the system flagged these files as executable, which is **inconsistent with their standard purpose**.\n\n3. **Volume and Pattern**:\n   - **15+ files** are detected in a short timeframe, all under the same GUID folder. This could indicate:\n     - A **malicious payload** being unpacked or executed in memory (e.g., a dropper or unpacker).\n     - A **false positive** if the security tool misclassifies `.mui`\/`.dll` files as executable.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Risks:\n- **Malware Activity**: The GUID folder and multiple `.dll`\/`.mui` files in `Temp` could be part of a **malicious payload** (e.g., a dropper, loader, or packer).\n- **False Positive**: If the detection rule is overly broad, it might flag legitimate files (e.g., during a Windows update or deployment).\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Investigate the Files**:\n   - Check the **hashes** of the files (e.g., SHA-256) against known-good repositories (e.g., VirusTotal, Microsoft Defender).\n   - Verify **digital signatures** to ensure the files are legitimate.\n\n2. **Monitor Dism.exe Behavior**:\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **ProcDump** to analyze `Dism.exe`'s activity and confirm if it’s interacting with these files.\n   - Check for **unusual parent processes** or command-line arguments for `Dism.exe`.\n\n3. **Check for Malicious Activity**:\n   - Scan the system with an updated antivirus\/EDR solution.\n   - Look for **network connections** or **registry changes** that might indicate persistence or data exfiltration.\n\n4. **Review Deployment Context**:\n   - If this is part of a **Windows deployment** (e.g., sysprep, imaging), confirm that the files align with legitimate deployment tools (e.g., `FfuProvider.dll` is part of the **Firmware Update Tool**).\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile `Dism.exe` is a legitimate process, the **abnormal detection of multiple executable files in `Temp`** raises **concerns about potential malicious activity**. Further investigation is required to confirm whether this is a **false positive** or a **security incident**."}

This rule might be triggering because these DLLs are being executed, which is not typical for DLLs. Usually, DLLs are loaded by other executables, not executed directly. If Dism.exe is executing them, that might be unusual. But I need to check if that's normal behavior for Dism.\n\nAnother point is the number of events. There are 16 entries, all from the same process (Dism.exe) and same directory. This could be a sign of a large-scale operation, possibly malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the combination of multiple DLLs in Temp, all detected by the same rule, might be a red flag.\n\nI should also consider if there's any known legitimate use of these DLLs. For example, some of the names like SysprepProvider.dll might be related to system preparation tools, which are part of Windows setup. But again, having so many different providers in the same directory might be unusual.\n\nIn conclusion, while some of these could be legitimate, the sheer number of DLLs, their presence in the Temp folder, and the fact that they're all being detected by the same rule might indicate a potential security threat. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events indicates a potential security concern and warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Tool Misuse:**\n   - **`Dism.exe`** is a legitimate Windows tool for deployment and imaging. However, its interaction with **DLLs in the Temp directory** raises suspicion, as DLLs are typically loaded by other processes, not executed directly.\n\n2. **Unusual File Patterns:**\n   - **Multiple DLLs** (e.g., `FolderProvider.dll`, `SysprepProvider.dll`, `TransmogProvider.dll`) are being detected in the **same temporary directory** (`AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`). \n   - The **repetition of the GUID** in the path suggests these files are part of a single operation, which could be either a legitimate process or a malicious payload.\n\n3. **Triggering Rule:**\n   - The **\"File Executable Detected\"** rule implies these DLLs are being executed, which is **atypical for DLLs**. This behavior could indicate **malware** or **unauthorized code execution**.\n\n4. **Volume and Context:**\n   - **16 events** from the same process (`Dism.exe`) in a short timeframe suggest a **large-scale operation**. While Dism may interact with many files during imaging, the **concentration of DLLs** in Temp and their names (e.g., `ProvProvider.dll`, `UnattendProvider.dll`) align with **Windows Setup\/Deployment** tools but could also mimic **malicious component names**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats:**\n- **Malware Masquerading as Legitimate Files:** The DLLs could be **dropped by malware** to evade detection, using the Temp directory as a staging area.\n- **Compromised System:** If `Dism.exe` is being manipulated (e.g., via **DLL hijacking** or **process injection**), this could indicate a **compromised system**.\n- **False Positives:** The rule might be overly broad, flagging **legitimate deployment activities** (e.g., Windows Update or sysprep operations).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Check File Hashes:**\n   - Analyze the hashes of the DLLs to determine if they match **known good signatures** (e.g., Windows Update files) or **malware databases** (e.g., VirusTotal).\n\n2. **Monitor Parent Processes:**\n   - Investigate the **parent process** of `Dism.exe` to ensure it is a legitimate Windows component (e.g., `WindowsSetup.exe` or `Sysprep.exe`).\n\n3. **Review System Logs:**\n   - Correlate these events with **Windows Event Logs** (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-Sysprep` or `Microsoft-Windows-Deployment` logs) to determine if they are part of a **scheduled deployment**.\n\n4. **Network Behavior:**\n   - Check for **unusual network traffic** from the system during this activity (e.g., outbound connections to unknown IPs).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activity could be legitimate (e.g., during a Windows deployment), the **abundance of DLLs in Temp**, **execution of DLLs**, and **repetition of the GUID** strongly suggest **further investigation is required**. This batch is **interesting for investigation** due to the potential for **malicious activity** or **false positives**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a lot of activity related to Dism.exe and DismHost.exe. The initial event shows Dism.exe detecting a file executable, which is WimProvider.dll in the Temp directory. Then, DismHost.exe is loading several DLLs, all of which are in the same Temp folder. The filenames like DismCorePS.dll, DismProv.dll, OSProvider.dll, etc., seem to be legitimate parts of the DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management) tool, which is used for Windows image deployment.\n\nHowever, the fact that all these DLLs are being loaded from the Temp directory might be a red flag. Typically, system tools like DISM would use their own directories, not the Temp folder. The Temp directory is often used by malware to store temporary files, so this could be a sign of something unusual. Also, the first event mentions a file being detected as executable, which might be normal, but combined with the subsequent loading of multiple DLLs from the same location, it raises suspicion.\n\nAnother point is that the last event shows Dism.exe deleting the AppxProvider.dll file from the Temp directory. If this is part of a legitimate process, the deletion might be normal, but if the file was just loaded and then deleted, it could be an attempt to remove evidence. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. While the presence of multiple DLLs in the Temp directory is suspicious, DISM does sometimes use temporary files. However, the combination of multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs from the same Temp path, along with the deletion, might indicate a potential malicious activity. But since DISM is a legitimate tool, it's possible that this is just normal operation. Still, the fact that all these files are in Temp and being deleted after use is a bit unusual. I think this warrants a moderate level of concern, so the classification as \"Suspicious\" with a confidence of 0.65 seems appropriate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"Suspicious\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"analysis\": \"The events involve multiple DLLs being loaded from a temporary directory (`AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`) by `DismHost.exe`, which is part of the DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management) tool. While DISM is a legitimate Windows utility, the pattern of loading numerous provider DLLs (e.g., `AppxProvider.dll`, `SmiProvider.dll`) from a temporary directory, followed by deletion of one of the files (`AppxProvider.dll`), raises suspicion. Legitimate DISM operations typically use system directories, not temporary folders, and the deletion of a file after use could indicate an attempt to obscure activity. However, without additional context (e.g., process tree, parent-child relationships, or network activity), it is unclear whether this is benign or malicious.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. All the events are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for image deployment and servicing. The main actions here are file deletions and a file creation time change. The files being deleted are in the Temp directory under a specific GUID path, which is common for temporary files. \n\nNow, the key points to consider: Dism.exe is known to be used in legitimate system updates and repairs. However, if it's deleting a large number of files, especially in the Temp folder, that might be normal during a cleanup process. But the fact that all these deletions are logged by the FileDeleteDetected rule could indicate that the system's monitoring is flagging these actions. \n\nWait, but the user is asking if this batch is interesting for investigation. The justification needs to be concise. Since all the files are in the Temp directory and are associated with Dism.exe, which is a legitimate process, this might just be part of a normal system operation. However, the high number of deletions might be a red flag. But I need to check if there's any suspicious pattern. \n\nLooking at the file names: AssocProvider.dll, CbsProvider.dll, DismCore.dll, etc. These seem to be related to system components, but again, Dism.exe is known to handle such files. The presence of both .dll and .mui files (which are language-specific resource files) in the Temp directory might be part of a legitimate update process. \n\nHowever, the fact that all these deletions are happening in a short period and from the same process might be worth investigating. But given that Dism.exe is a legitimate tool, and the Temp directory is a common place for temporary files, this might not be malicious. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that while the volume of deletions is notable, the process involved is legitimate, and the files are in a temporary directory. Therefore, this might not be a security threat but could be part of normal system activity. However, it's still worth monitoring to ensure that Dism.exe isn't being used for unintended purposes.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the `Dism.exe` process (a legitimate Windows tool for image deployment and servicing) is deleting multiple files from a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`).

All of them are related to file deletions logged by the FileDeleteDetected rule, and the process involved is Dism.exe. The files being deleted are all .mui files located in the Temp directory under a specific GUID path. \n\nFirst, I know that Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. It's common during system setup or image modifications. The .mui files are language-specific resource files, often used for localization. However, the fact that so many of them are being deleted in quick succession might be noteworthy.\n\nNow, considering the path: the Temp directory is a common place for temporary files, and GUIDs in filenames are typical for temporary or unique files. But the sheer number of deletions here could indicate either a legitimate process, like a cleanup after an imaging operation, or something suspicious.\n\nBut wait, why so many deletions? If this is part of a normal system process, like running DISM commands to modify an image, it might generate a lot of temporary files that are then cleaned up. However, if this is happening on a system that's not undergoing such operations, it could be a red flag. \n\nHowever, the user hasn't provided any other context, like other events or processes. The logs only show deletions by Dism.exe. Since Dism.exe is a legitimate process, and the files are in Temp, it's possible that this is a normal operation. But the high number of deletions (15 entries) might be more than usual. \n\nOn the other hand, malware sometimes deletes files to cover its tracks. But if the process is Dism.exe, which is trusted, it's less likely to be malicious. However, if the system is compromised and Dism.exe is being used by an attacker, that's a concern. But without additional events, like unexpected execution of Dism.exe or other malicious activities, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe key here is that all the events are related to a single process and the files are in the Temp directory. The system might be performing a legitimate task. However, the large number of deletions could be considered unusual. But given that the process is known and the files are temporary, maybe it's not a threat. \n\nSo, the classification here might be on the fence.

Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Legitimate Tool**: `Dism.exe` is a core Windows utility often used during system imaging, deployment, or updates. Its presence alone is not suspicious.\n2. **Temporary Files**: The files being deleted (e.g., `WimProvider.dll.mui`, `SysprepProvider.dll`) are named after components associated with Windows Imaging and Setup.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user provided a bunch of log entries that look like they're from a Windows system, probably from something like the Windows Event Log or maybe a security tool like Sentinel or something similar. Each entry has a \"process\" field, a \"winlog\" field, and a \"file\" field, which is \"None\" in all cases.\n\nLooking at the first entry, the process is \"svchost.exe\" and the winlog task is \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\". That makes sense because svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, so creating a process might be part of starting a service.\n\nThen there's a lot of entries where the process command line is a PowerShell script that uses New-Service and Start-Service to create and start a service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". The winlog task here is \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\" repeated multiple times. That seems a bit odd. Normally, creating a service would trigger a \"Registry value set\" event, but maybe these logs are from a different source or a custom rule.\n\nThe last few entries have a different PowerShell command that writes \"Final result: 1\" to the host. These also have the same \"Provider Lifecycle\" task. The repetition of the same command line and task might indicate that these are test events or part of a scripted process that's being logged multiple times.\n\nI notice that the \"file\" field is \"None\" in all entries, which might mean that the logging system doesn't have file information for these events, or they're process-related and not file-based. The \"winlog\" task seems to be categorizing the events, but the tasks like \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" don't immediately ring a bell as standard Windows event tasks. Maybe they're from a specific tool or a custom rule set.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the same PowerShell command is repeated multiple times, which could be part of a loop or a test scenario. The use of New-Service and Start-Service suggests that someone is trying to create a new service on the system, which could be a legitimate action (like installing software) or potentially malicious (like setting up a backdoor).\n\nThe binary path points to \"tarefa_logico.exe\" located in \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\\". The presence of such a file might be normal in some applications, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that a new service is being created dynamically through PowerShell could be a red flag, especially if the system is not expecting such changes.\n\nAlso, the \"task\" field in the winlog entries varies between \"Provider Lifecycle\", \"Engine Lifecycle\", and \"Registry value set\". The \"Registry value set\" is more typical for service creation, as services are registered in the registry. The other tasks might be from a different logging component or a misconfigured rule.\n\nIn summary, the logs show a series of events where a new service is being created and started using PowerShell, which is a common technique in both legitimate software installation and malicious activities. The repetition of the same command and the presence of \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks might indicate testing or a specific logging configuration. The absence of file information and the use of \"None\" in the \"file\" field could be a limitation of the logging system or the data source.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a sequence of events involving the creation and execution of a new service on a Windows system, likely through PowerShell. Here's a breakdown of the key observations and potential implications:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Events and Analysis**\n\n1. **Service Creation via PowerShell**:\n   - **Command Line**:  \n     ```\n     powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\" ; Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n     ```\n   - **Action**:  \n     A new Windows service named `objeto_ativo` is created and immediately started, pointing to the executable `tarefa_logico.exe` located in the directory `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\`.  \n   - **Implications**:  \n     - This is a **legitimate administrative action** if the service is part of a known application (e.g., a custom tool or service).  \n     - However, **unauthorized service creation** (e.g., without user consent or from an untrusted source) could indicate **malicious activity**, such as persistence mechanisms for malware.\n\n2. **Repetition of Events**:\n   - The same PowerShell command is logged **multiple times**, possibly due to:\n     - **Testing or automation scripts** (e.g., looping or retrying the command).\n     - **Misconfigured logging** (e.g., duplicate entries from a tool or rule).\n     - **Malicious behavior** (e.g., attempting to bypass detection by repeating the same action).\n\n3. **Log Context**:\n   - **`winlog.task` Values**:  \n     - **\"Provider Lifecycle\"** and **\"Engine Lifecycle\"** are non-standard Windows event categories. These may be:\n       - **Custom logging rules** from a security tool (e.g., Sentinel, SIEM, or EDR systems).\n       - **Misconfigured event classification** (e.g., incorrect mapping of event IDs to tasks).\n     - **\"Registry value set\"** (in one log) aligns with standard Windows service creation, which modifies the registry under `HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services`.\n\n4. **File Context**:\n   - The **`file` field is \"None\"** in all logs, suggesting:\n     - The logs are **process-related** (not file-based).\n     - The logging system may not have file metadata or is limited to process events.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns and Recommendations**\n\n#### **1. Unusual or Suspicious Behavior**\n   - **Service Creation**:  \n     - **Legitimate Use Case**: If `tarefa_logico.exe` is part of a known, trusted application (e.g., a business tool or internal software).  \n     - **Suspicious Use Case**: If the service is created **unexpectedly** (e.g., without user interaction) or if `tarefa_logico.exe` is not a recognized file.  \n     - **Action**:  \n       - Verify the **integrity of `tarefa_logico.exe`** (e.g., check its digital signature, file hash, and reputation via VirusTotal or AV tools).  \n       - Review **system logs** for other anomalies (e.g., unauthorized access, unexpected network activity).\n\n#### **2. Log Analysis and Investigation**\n   - **Check for Other Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**:  \n     - Look for additional PowerShell commands, registry changes, or network connections in logs.  \n     - Use tools like **Windows Event Viewer**, **SIEM systems**, or **EDR platforms** (e.g., CrowdStrike, SentinelOne) to correlate events.  \n   - **Investigate the Source of the PowerShell Command**:  \n     - Determine if the command was executed by a **user account** (e.g., admin, service account) or **automated process** (e.g., scheduled task, script).  \n     - Check for **unusual user activity** (e.g., lateral movement, privilege escalation).\n\n#### **3. Mitigation and Defense**\n   - **Restrict PowerShell Usage**:  \n     - Enforce **Least Privilege** policies to limit PowerShell execution to trusted users\/roles.  \n     - Use **AppLocker** or **Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)** to block unauthorized scripts.  \n   - **Monitor Service Creation**:  \n     - Use **Group Policy** or **audit policies** to log all service creation and modification events (e.g., `Audit Object Access` under `Local Security Policy`).  \n   - **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**:  \n     - Monitor changes to the registry and critical directories (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32`, `C:\\Program Files`) for unauthorized modifications.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n- The logs show a **service creation event** via PowerShell, which is a **normal administrative action** if legitimate but **potentially malicious** if unauthorized.  \n- The repetition of the same command and non-standard `winlog.task` values suggest **testing, misconfiguration, or malicious intent**.  \n- Further investigation is required to determine the **legitimacy of the service** and the **source of the PowerShell command**.  \n\nIf this is part of a **security incident**, prioritize isolating the affected system and conducting a full forensic analysis. If it's a **legitimate deployment**, ensure that all actions are properly documented and monitored."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing a process event. My job is to determine if this entire batch is worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the command lines. The first few entries are simple Write-Host commands, which just output text. Those seem benign, maybe part of a test or normal script. But then I notice several entries where PowerShell is scanning INF files in the Windows directory. The command is looking for specific sections in these INF files, like [defaultinstall.nt...], which are typically used in Windows setup and installation processes.\n\nNow, why would someone be scanning INF files? INF files are used to install drivers or other system components. If a script is checking for the presence of certain sections in these files, it might be looking for signs of a specific installation or configuration. However, the fact that this is done repeatedly through PowerShell could be suspicious. Especially since the ExecutionPolicy is set to Restricted, which usually prevents scripts from running unless they're signed or from a trusted source. But the command itself isn't malicious on the surface—it's just reading files and checking for patterns.\n\nWait, but why so many repeated commands? There are multiple entries with the same command line, which might indicate that the process is being executed multiple times, perhaps by different triggers or as part of a larger operation. However, without additional context like file changes, network activity, or other processes, it's hard to tell if this is a red flag or just a normal system check.\n\nAnother angle: the use of PowerShell with Restricted ExecutionPolicy. Normally, scripts under Restricted can't run unless they're signed or from a trusted location. But the command here is a one-liner, which might be allowed. However, if this is part of a larger malicious script, the presence of such commands might be a sign. But in this case, the commands themselves don't seem to do anything harmful—they just check the INF files and output a result.\n\nThe justification for \"INTERESTING\" would be the repeated scanning of INF files, which could be part of an attempt to detect system configuration or look for vulnerabilities. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence is medium because while the behavior is unusual, it's not definitively malicious. But since the user is asking for classification based on the entire batch, and there's a pattern here that could be indicative of probing the system, I'm leaning towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes repeatedly scanning Windows INF files for specific installation sections, which could indicate system enumeration or probing for vulnerabilities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
