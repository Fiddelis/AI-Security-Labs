The first thing I notice is that PowerShell is being used multiple times, which isn't necessarily bad, but in security contexts, it's often a red flag because attackers use it for malicious purposes.\n\nLooking at the specific events, there's a ProcessCreate event where PowerShell is executed with a command line that includes creating a new PSDrive pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That looks suspicious because accessing a remote share like C$ might indicate trying to access another machine's file system, possibly for data exfiltration or lateral movement.\n\nThen there are several FileCreate and FileDelete events. A temporary file is created and then immediately deleted. That's common in some legitimate scenarios, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of an attack. The file names have extensions like .ps1, which are PowerShell scripts. Creating and deleting such files quickly could be an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving traces.\n\nThere are also ImageLoad events for DLLs like mscoreei.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpClient.dll. While these are legitimate system files, loading them in the context of PowerShell might be part of a larger malicious process. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe repeated use of whoami.exe is normal, as it's used to check the current user, but combined with PowerShell activities, it might be part of reconnaissance.\n\nHowever, I don't see any direct evidence of malicious activity like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or exploitation.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There's a lot of ImageLoad events, which means PowerShell is loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard system files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal, but there's also a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1. Then, that same file is deleted. Creating and deleting a script in Temp might be suspicious, especially if it's part of a test, but maybe it's just a normal operation. However, the presence of a script being created and then deleted could be a sign of something trying to execute a script without leaving traces.\n\nAnother thing is the command line for PowerShell: \"& {}\" which is an empty command. That might be a red flag because sometimes attackers use this to bypass detection. Also, there are multiple ProcessCreate, ProcessAccess, and ImageLoad events, which could indicate that PowerShell is being used for more than just regular tasks. The repeated access and image loading might suggest that something is trying to inject code or load malicious modules.\n\nThe Registry value set events and Pipe Created event could be part of establishing communication channels or modifying system settings. However, without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious. But combined with the file creation and deletion, it's possible that this is part of a script execution that's trying to hide its activities.\n\nI should also check for any anomalies. The fact that the same script is created and then deleted quickly might be an attempt to execute a script and then remove it. The use of PowerShell with empty commands could be a way to avoid detection. However, some of these DLLs are legitimate, so it's not conclusive. But the combination of these events does raise some flags that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events show suspicious behavior: creation of a temporary script file followed by immediate deletion, repeated image loading of .NET and Windows Defender DLLs (potentially for code injection), and use of empty command-line arguments ('& {}') which may indicate evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs. The files mentioned are mostly system-related, like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. These are legitimate system files, so loading them might be normal. However, there's a pattern here—multiple Image Load events for PowerShell. That could be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell for malicious activities.\n\nThen there's a File Created event for a temporary script file, and then it's deleted. That might be part of a legitimate process, like a script that's being tested and then cleaned up. But the fact that it's created and deleted quickly could be suspicious. Also, there's a Pipe Created event, which isn't necessarily bad, but in combination with other events might indicate something.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the PowerShell processes, there's a check for the existence of procdump.exe. Procdump is a legitimate tool, but it's sometimes used by attackers to dump memory from processes. The fact that the script is checking if procdump.exe exists could be a red flag. If the script is trying to locate procdump.exe, maybe it's preparing to use it for some purpose, like dumping memory from another process, which could be part of an attack.\n\nThere are also multiple Process Access events. These could be normal, but if they're accessing sensitive processes or resources, that's a concern. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe is normal—it's a standard command to check user identity. But the repeated PowerShell events and the check for procdump.exe make me think there might be something going on here. The combination of creating and deleting a script file, loading various DLLs, and checking for procdump.exe might indicate an attempt to execute a script or perform some operations that are not entirely benign.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these events could be part of normal system operations or legitimate scripts. The key is whether there's a suspicious pattern. The check for procdump.exe stands out because it's a tool that can be used in attacks. If the script is trying to locate procdump.exe, it might be part of a larger malicious activity, like preparing to inject code or dump memory.\n\nBut since the batch doesn't show any direct malicious activity like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, or modifying critical system files, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence here would be moderate. It's not a clear-cut attack, but there are enough suspicious elements to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe image loads of legitimate system DLLs (e.g., clr.dll, mscoreei.dll) combined with a temporary script file creation and deletion, and a suspicious command-line check for 'procdump.exe' (a tool sometimes abused by attackers for memory dumping).

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' loading images. The first one is loading clr.dll, which is part of the .NET Framework. That seems normal. The second one is System.Management.Automation.ni.dll, which is related to PowerShell's modules. Also normal. The third one is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Hmm, that's a bit more suspicious. Why is PowerShell loading a Defender DLL? Maybe it's part of a legitimate process, but it's worth noting.\n\nThen there's a file deletion event for a temporary PowerShell script. Deleting a temp file might be normal, but depending on context. Next, there's a pipe created event, which isn't too concerning on its own. File creation in the StartupProfileData folder—PowerShell's startup profiles are usually in that location, so that's likely legitimate.\n\nProcess accessed events for PowerShell and other processes like whoami.exe and cmd.exe. The cmd.exe event has a command to disable the firewall using netsh. Oh, that's a red flag. Disabling the firewall is a common tactic in attacks to prevent detection. Then there's netsh.exe actually executing that command. That's definitely suspicious.\n\nThe svchost.exe entries are all related to registry changes. Multiple registry events could indicate someone modifying system settings, which is often part of persistence or configuration changes by malware. However, svchost.exe is a common host process, so it's not always malicious, but combined with other events, it's concerning.\n\nPutting it all together: the firewall disable command via netsh is a clear indicator of malicious intent. The registry modifications by svchost.exe could be part of setting up persistence or altering system behavior. The PowerShell activities, while some are normal, the combination with the firewall disable and registry changes suggests an attack in progress. Even though some events are legitimate, the presence of these specific actions raises the confidence level. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.85. The justification is the firewall disable and suspicious registry changes.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell loading Windows Defender DLLs, deletion of temporary script files, registry modifications by svchost.exe, and execution of 'netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off' to disable firewall.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. The user provided a bunch of JSON lines, all looking similar. Each entry has a process named 'svchost.exe' and a winlog event about a registry object being added or deleted. There's no file information mentioned.\n\nFirst, I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, it's also commonly abused by malware to hide malicious activities. The registry events here are all the same: \"Registry object added or deleted (rule: RegistryEvent)\". \n\nNow, the key point here is the repetition. There are 30 identical entries. If this is a normal system activity, you might expect some variation in the registry keys or other details. But since all the events are the same, it could indicate a script or automated process making the same change repeatedly. That's suspicious.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's a legitimate service that's being started multiple times, causing the same registry event each time. However, svchost.exe usually runs multiple services, but the same event being logged 30 times in a row seems unusual. Typically, such events would be spread out over time, not all in the same batch.\n\nAnother angle: if these events are part of a normal operation, the system would have other related events, like process creation or network activity. But the user only provided these registry events. Without additional context, the repetition and lack of variation make this look like a potential attack, such as an attempt to modify the registry to persist or inject code.\n\nHowever, I should consider that maybe these are just a few events that got logged multiple times. But 30 times? That's a lot. Even if it's a legitimate service, having the same event repeated that many times is not typical. It might be a sign of a malicious process trying to modify the registry to maintain persistence, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nSo, the classification here would be \"INTERESTING\" because the same event repeated so many times is suspicious. The justification is the high number of identical registry events involving svchost.exe, which could indicate malicious activity. The confidence is high, maybe around 0.9, since the repetition is a strong indicator of something unusual.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical registry events related to svchost.exe, a common host for malicious activity, suggest potential tampering or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}

The first thing I notice is that almost all of them are from svchost.exe, which is a normal Windows process that hosts various system services. But there's a lot of them, like 20 entries. Most of the winlog tasks are about registry changes, like \"Registry object added or deleted\" and \"Registry value set\". Then there's one about a \"Pipe Created\" event.\n\nBut wait, the key thing here is the command line in some of the processes. There are several entries where the command_line is \"powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\". Hmm, that looks suspicious. Creating a new PSDrive in PowerShell to map a network share, specifically \\\\Target\\\\C$. That could be part of an attack where an adversary is trying to access remote systems or escalate privileges. \n\nNow, svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's executing PowerShell commands like this, especially multiple times, that's not normal. Also, the repetition of the same command line across multiple events might indicate automated or malicious activity. However, I should check if there's any other context. The other events are just registry changes, which can be normal, but combined with the PowerShell commands, it might be a sign of something malicious.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that svchost.exe is involved. Could this be part of a legitimate system process? Maybe, but the use of PowerShell to create a new PSDrive with a network path might be an indicator of compromise. Also, the presence of multiple identical command lines suggests that the same action is being repeated, which is not typical for normal operations. \n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple registry events from svchost.exe, which is normal, but combined with repeated PowerShell commands that map a network share, this could be a sign of an attacker trying to access remote systems or set up persistence. Therefore, this batch is interesting and should be investigated further.

The first few entries have the command line 'powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}'. That seems suspicious because creating a new PSDrive with a network path might be part of establishing a connection to a remote system, which is common in attacks.\n\nThen there are several entries with empty script blocks '{}', which might be benign, but when combined with other commands, could be part of a larger malicious script. However, the more concerning part is the later entries where they're checking for the existence of 'procdump.exe' in a specific path. ProcDump is a legitimate tool, but its presence in unexpected directories or being used in certain contexts can indicate malicious activity, like memory dumping for extracting credentials or other sensitive data.\n\nThe repeated checks for the file's existence might be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain tools are available on the system. If the file isn't found, the script exits with an error code. This could be part of a multi-stage attack where the attacker is checking for prerequisites before proceeding with more harmful actions.\n\nAlso, the use of 'unidade_auxiliar' which translates to 'auxiliary unit' in Portuguese might indicate that the system is in a non-English environment, which could be a red flag if the attacker is using localized terms to avoid detection. The combination of creating a PSDrive to a remote machine and checking for specific executables suggests potential lateral movement or data exfiltration efforts.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to overinterpret. Some of these commands could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. But given the combination of creating network drives, checking for specific tools, and the repetition of these commands, it's more likely that this is a malicious activity. The confidence is high, but not certain, so I'd rate it around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands attempt to create a network drive mapping to \\\\Target\\\\C$ and repeatedly check for the presence of procdump.exe in non-standard paths, suggesting potential lateral movement or data extraction attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
