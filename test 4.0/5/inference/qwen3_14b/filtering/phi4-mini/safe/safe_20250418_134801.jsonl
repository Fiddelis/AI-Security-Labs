The first thing I notice is the process \"MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.54.exe\" with a file creation time change. That might be normal during an update, but then there's a setup.exe in a temporary directory. The path includes a GUID, which is common for temporary files, but the fact that it's being created in the EdgeUpdate folder could be suspicious.\n\nNext, there's CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll. That's a legitimate process, but loading amsi.dll might be part of normal operations. Then setup.exe creating a pipe. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nThe services.exe logon events and user account management tasks are normal system activities. The PowerShell command is interesting—it's checking INF files for certain patterns. The command line mentions defaultinstall sections, which could be related to driver installation or system updates. However, the execution policy is set to Restricted, which might limit script execution, but the fact that it's running a script that scans INF files could be part of a legitimate update process or maybe a custom script.\n\nThere's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file is a .yml.new, which might be part of a configuration update. But if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of tampering. Also, the repeated events of MpCmdRun.exe from Windows Defender loading various DLLs are normal, but the presence of multiple FileCreate and ImageLoad events might indicate some activity.\n\nLooking at the MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe deleting a temporary file. That's part of the update process. However, the combination of these events—setup.exe, pipe creation, PowerShell scanning INF files, and the Edge update activities—might be part of a legitimate update. But the presence of multiple FileCreate events in temporary directories and the use of a GUID in the file path could be red flags. \n\nWait, the PowerShell command is scanning INF files for defaultinstall sections. INF files are used in Windows for installing drivers and other software. If this script is checking for those sections, it might be part of a legitimate update or a malicious payload trying to detect if it's running in a controlled environment. But without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. The events don't show obvious malicious activity like unauthorized access or known malware. However, the setup.exe from a temporary directory, the pipe creation, and the PowerShell script scanning INF files could be part of a more complex attack. Since there's no direct evidence of compromise, but the combination of events is unusual, I might lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence. The justification is that the activities involve setup processes, PowerShell scripts scanning system files, and temporary files which could indicate an ongoing update or potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes events involving setup.exe from a temporary directory, PowerShell scanning INF files for installation patterns, and multiple file creation events in system directories.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, each indicating that a file was created by git.exe in the node_modules\/semver directory. The files mentioned are various JavaScript files and some package.json, preload.js, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior or something suspicious. Git is a version control system, and when you clone a repository or pull changes, it's common for it to create files in the node_modules directory, especially if there are dependencies involved. The semver package is a common npm package used for semantic versioning, so having files from semver in node_modules seems legitimate.\n\nHowever, the key here is that all these files are being created by git.exe. Typically, git.exe would interact with the .git directory, not the node_modules. Node_modules are usually managed by npm or yarn, not git. So this might be unusual. But maybe the user is using git to manage the node_modules? That doesn't sound standard. Alternatively, maybe there's a misconfiguration or a third-party tool that's causing git to interact with node_modules.\n\nAnother angle: are these files being created as part of a normal git operation? For example, if the user is adding files to the repository, but that would usually be in the root or other directories, not specifically in node_modules. Also, the fact that multiple files are being created in a structured way (functions, internal, ranges) suggests that it's part of a package structure, which again points to npm packages rather than git operations.\n\nBut wait, the events are all FileCreate events. If git is creating these files, maybe it's part of a checkout or clone operation. However, when you clone a repo, git doesn't create the node_modules directory. That's usually done by npm install. So this could be a red flag. Maybe the user is using a custom setup where git is involved in managing node_modules, which is not standard. Alternatively, it could be a sign of a malicious activity where git is being used to inject files into the node_modules directory.\n\nBut without more context, like other events or processes, it's hard to say. However, the fact that multiple files are being created in a structured manner by git.exe in the node_modules directory is suspicious. It's not typical behavior, and could indicate an anomaly. However, it's possible that the user is doing something non-standard, but in the absence of other indicators, this might be worth investigating.\n\nSo, considering all that, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" because the behavior is not standard for git.exe.
