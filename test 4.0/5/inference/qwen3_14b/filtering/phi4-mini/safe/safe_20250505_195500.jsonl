{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by a hash. That seems a bit odd. Why so many files? And why are they all being created by the same process?\n\nWait, the first entry has a process null and a security group management task. That might be a red herring, but the rest are all SDXHelper.exe creating these files. Now, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, right? But creating so many minified JavaScript files in the PackageResources folder... That doesn't sound normal. Typically, those files would be part of an application's resources, but creating them repeatedly might indicate something like a malware dropper or a data exfiltration attempt.\n\nAlso, the filenames have hashes, which could be obfuscation. Maybe the files are malicious, and the hashes are used to avoid detection. But I need to check if this is a known legitimate behavior. If SDXHelper.exe is supposed to generate these files during normal operations, then it's okay. But if not, this could be a problem.\n\nAnother point is the repetition. The same file is being created multiple times. That might be a sign of a loop or an attempt to overwrite files, which could be malicious. However, without more context, like the system's usual behavior, it's hard to say. But given that all these files are in the Office directory and created by SDXHelper, it's possible that this is a legitimate process. However, the sheer number of files and their repetitive creation might still be suspicious.\n\nI should also consider if there are any known issues with SDXHelper.exe creating such files. Maybe it's part of an update or a feature that's not well-documented. But if this is a new occurrence, it could be a sign of compromise. \n\nIn the absence of more information, the best approach is to flag this as potentially interesting because the behavior deviates from typical expected actions. The security team would need to investigate further, maybe check the files' contents, verify the process's legitimacy, and look for other indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit behavior that warrants further investigation due to several suspicious patterns:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` (associated with Microsoft Office) is repeatedly creating files named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js` in the directory `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`.\n   - **Unusual Behavior:** While `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft process, the **repetitive generation of minified JavaScript files with unique hashes** is atypical. This could indicate:\n     - **Malicious Activity:** The files might be obfuscated payloads, droppers, or part of a data exfiltration attempt (e.g., hashes could be used to evade detection).\n     - **Legitimate but Unusual:** If this is part of a new Office feature or update, it would require confirmation from Microsoft.\n\n2. **File Naming and Hashes:**\n   - The filenames use **hashes** (e.g., `min_2e8895595f238811259691f33f822ecc.js`), which is common in malware to avoid signature detection. This raises concerns about potential **malware or adversarial activity**.\n\n3. **Lack of Contextual Clues:**\n   - No logs indicate **user interaction**, **system updates**, or **legitimate Office operations** (e.g., installation, activation). This absence of context makes the activity harder to classify as benign.\n\n4. **Isolated Log Entry:**\n   - One entry mentions **\"Security Group Management\"** with `process=null` and `file=null`. While this could be a benign system event, it is **isolated and uncorrelated** with the rest of the logs, making it unclear if it is related.\n\n---\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **Likely Legitimate?** Unlikely. `SDXHelper.exe` is not typically associated with generating such files, and the repetitive, hash-based naming is suspicious.\n- **Potential Threat:** The activity aligns with **malware behavior** (e.g., file droppers, persistence mechanisms) or **adversarial exploitation** of Office processes.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Actions:\n1. **Verify File Integrity:**\n   - Analyze the contents of the generated files (e.g., via sandboxing, hash lookup in VirusTotal, or YARA rules) to determine if they are malicious.\n2. **Check for Malware Signatures:**\n   - Scan the system for malware using updated antivirus tools.\n3. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Confirm if this process is behaving unusually (e.g., network connections, registry changes).\n4. **Monitor for Similar Activity:**\n   - Look for other unexpected file creation or process behavior in the same directory.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and should be investigated further. While `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate process, the repetitive generation of obfuscated JavaScript files in a non-standard directory raises concerns about **potential compromise**. Immediate analysis of the files and system is recommended."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and they want to know if there's anything suspicious going on. Alright, first, I need to look through these logs and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the entries are about files being created by a process called SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files, and they're being placed in a specific directory under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The filenames have a pattern with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash or some random string and \".js\". \n\nWait, \"officeaicopilot\" might be a clue. I remember that Microsoft has something called AI Copilot, which is an AI assistant integrated into Office apps. So maybe these files are related to that feature. But why are they being created so frequently? Let me check the timestamps. The user hasn't provided timestamps, but the fact that there are multiple entries with the same filename might indicate that the same file is being created multiple times, which could be normal if it's part of an update or installation process. However, it's also possible that it's a malicious process creating multiple copies of the same file to hide its activity.\n\nAnother entry is about chrome.exe setting a registry value. That's a normal activity for Chrome, but I should check if there's any unusual registry key being modified. However, the log doesn't specify the registry key, so I can't tell for sure. It might be benign, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the SDXHelper.exe entries again. SDXHelper is a legitimate process, part of the Microsoft Office suite, used for various tasks like updates or add-ins. However, if this process is being used to create a lot of JavaScript files, maybe it's being exploited. But again, if it's related to AI Copilot, maybe it's just part of the normal operation. The key here is the frequency and the nature of the files.\n\nWait, the filenames have \"min\" in them, which usually stands for \"minified\" JavaScript. That's common in web development, so maybe these are just normal resources. However, the fact that they're being created in the SolutionPackages directory might be part of an installation or update process. But why so many files? Maybe the AI Copilot feature requires multiple JavaScript files for different functions.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the repetition of the same filenames. For example, \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_499ca2f99a6c0438b4bf6156bb7f6036.js\" appears twice. That might be a normal part of the process, like a retry or a duplicate, but it's also possible that it's a sign of something malicious trying to overwrite or replace files.\n\nAlso, the presence of a registry event from chrome.exe could be unrelated, but if there's a connection between the registry change and the file creations, that might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to link them.\n\nI should also think about the possibility of a false positive. If the user is using a legitimate software that's generating these files, then it's not a threat. But if the user didn't install anything related to AI Copilot, then it might be suspicious.\n\nAnother angle: the SDXHelper.exe process is usually associated with Microsoft Office, but if the files are being created in a non-standard location or if there are unexpected processes running, that could be a problem. However, the path provided is under AppData, which is a common place for user-specific data.\n\nIn conclusion, without more context, it's hard to say definitively. The activity could be normal if it's related to AI Copilot updates, but the high frequency and repetition of files might warrant further investigation. The user should check if they've recently installed or updated any Microsoft Office components, especially AI Copilot. They could also run a malware scan to ensure that SDXHelper.exe isn't being used maliciously.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries provided show a series of **file creation events** by the `SDXHelper.exe` process (a legitimate Microsoft Office component) and a **registry modification** by `chrome.exe`. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation Activity**:\n   - **Frequent creation of JavaScript files** (`.js`) in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\fidelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`  \n     These files are named with a pattern:  \n     `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`  \n     (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_4fbdfb16bbe241df35afce95197ba8aa.js`).\n\n   - **Repetition of filenames**:  \n     Some files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_499ca2f99a6c0438b4bf6156bb7f6036.js`) appear **multiple times**, which could indicate:\n     - **Normal updates\/installs** (e.g., AI Copilot feature updates).\n     - **Malicious activity** (e.g., overwriting files, hiding malicious code).\n\n   - **Context**:  \n     The filename prefix `officeaicopilot-strings.min` suggests a **connection to Microsoft's AI Copilot** (an AI assistant integrated into Office apps). Minified `.js` files are common in web development and may be part of legitimate resource management.\n\n2. **Registry Modification by Chrome**:\n   - A single entry shows `chrome.exe` modifying a registry value. This is **normal** for Chrome (e.g., updating preferences or extensions), but **no specific registry key** is mentioned. Further investigation would be needed to confirm legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Unusual Frequency\/Repetition**:  \n  The repeated creation of the same files might be **normal** (e.g., retrying a failed operation) or **suspicious** (e.g., a malware dropper or persistence mechanism).  \n  **Mitigation**: Monitor the size and content of these files (e.g., check for obfuscation, unexpected code).\n\n- **SDXHelper.exe Behavior**:  \n  While `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate process, **if it's creating files outside typical directories** (e.g., user-specific AppData) or **if there are no clear user-initiated actions** (e.g., installing AI Copilot), this could indicate **malicious use** of the process.\n\n- **Lack of Timestamps**:  \n  Without timestamps, it's unclear whether these events occurred over a short period (potentially malicious) or were spread out (normal).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify AI Copilot Installation**:\n   - Check if Microsoft AI Copilot is installed or updated recently. This feature may generate such files during activation.\n\n2. **Inspect File Contents**:\n   - Use a hex editor or antivirus tool to scan the `.js` files for **malicious code** (e.g., obfuscation, unexpected network calls).\n\n3. **Monitor Process Behavior**:\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **ProcMon** to confirm that `SDXHelper.exe` is interacting with legitimate resources and not writing to unexpected locations.\n\n4. **Check for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan with an updated antivirus (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes) to rule out malware masquerading as `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n5. **Review Registry Changes**:\n   - If the Chrome registry modification is unrelated to user activity, investigate the **specific registry key** modified (e.g., `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\...`).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity **could be legitimate** (e.g., AI Copilot updates) but warrants **closer scrutiny** due to:\n- The **repetition of filenames**.\n- The **absence of clear user context** (e.g., recent software installation).\n- The **potential for misuse** of the `SDXHelper.exe` process.\n\nIf no AI Copilot-related activity is confirmed and the files appear suspicious, further investigation or malware analysis is recommended."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a list of file creation events, all under the same process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" in the directory related to Microsoft Office. The files have names that start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a hash or some unique identifier. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if these files are legitimate or if they might be part of a malicious activity. Since they're all created by the same process and in the same directory, it's possible they're part of a normal operation, like updates or language packs. However, the repetition of certain file names (like the one with \"9a8575295259d8d88fee11e5538812be.js\" appearing twice) might be a red flag. Maybe it's a sign of duplication or tampering.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the naming convention. The \"min_\" prefix could indicate minified JavaScript files, which are common in web applications. If this is related to Microsoft Office, perhaps these are part of some embedded web components or add-ins. However, the location in the \"OfflineFiles\" directory might be more concerning. Offline files are typically used for synchronization, so having a lot of JavaScript files there might not be standard.\n\nI should also check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a legitimate process. A quick search in my knowledge base shows that SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft's Office suite, specifically related to the Smart Document Extensions. So that part seems legitimate. But the large number of files being created could indicate an unusual amount of activity. Maybe a malware is using this process to drop files, or perhaps it's a normal update that's just generating a lot of files.\n\nThe repetition of files might be a sign of something wrong. If the same file is created multiple times, it could be an attempt to overwrite or replace existing files, which is a common tactic in malware. However, without more context, like the timestamps or the contents of the files, it's hard to be certain.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that these are just part of a normal operation. For example, if the system is syncing a lot of language packs or resources, creating multiple minified JS files might be part of that process. But the number here seems high—there are 17 entries, which is a lot for a single process.\n\nAnother angle is to look at the directory structure. The path is \"C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\OfflineFiles\\\". This is a standard location for Office-related files, but again, the presence of many JavaScript files might be unusual. Maybe the user is running a version of Office that has a lot of web-based components, but that's speculative.\n\nIn summary, while the process name is legitimate, the large number of identical or similar files being created in the OfflineFiles directory might warrant further investigation. It could be a normal operation, but it's also a potential indicator of malicious activity. The best course of action would be to check the integrity of the files, maybe using antivirus software or checking for any known issues with the Office installation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process (a legitimate component of Microsoft Office, associated with Smart Document Extensions) has created multiple **minified JavaScript files** (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`) in the **OfflineFiles** directory. Here's an analysis of the situation:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Process**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a known Microsoft Office component, often involved in managing document extensions or synchronization tasks. Its presence alone is not suspicious.\n\n2. **File Naming and Repetition**:\n   - The files are named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`, suggesting they may be **minified JavaScript resources** (common in web applications or Office add-ins).\n   - **Duplicates** (e.g., `min_9a8575295259d8d88fee11e5538812be.js` appearing twice) are notable. While not inherently malicious, this could indicate:\n     - **Redundant operations** (e.g., failed updates or retries).\n     - **Tampering** (malware overwriting files).\n     - **Legitimate caching** (if the system is syncing many resources).\n\n3. **Directory Context**:\n   - The **OfflineFiles** directory is used by Office for **synchronization and caching** (e.g., OneDrive, SharePoint, or local copies of online documents). This aligns with the process's role but raises questions about the **volume of files** generated.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Explanations**\n- **Normal Office Activity**:\n  - The files might be part of **language packs**, **add-ins**, or **web-based components** (e.g., embedded web parts in Office documents).\n  - The repetition could be due to **retries during sync** or **corruption** of cached files.\n\n- **Malicious Activity**:\n  - If the files are **unrelated to Office** (e.g., contain suspicious code or hashes not matching known Office resources), this could indicate **malware** using the legitimate process to **drop payloads**.\n  - The **large number of files** (17 entries) and **repetition** may suggest **unusual behavior** for a standard Office operation.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify File Integrity**:\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **Malwarebytes** to scan the files for malware.\n   - Check the **hashes** of the files against known Office resources (if available).\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Use **SIEM tools** (e.g., Microsoft Sentinel) to correlate this activity with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user behavior).\n   - Look for **unusual file modifications** or **unexpected network connections** from `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n3. **Review Office Updates**:\n   - Ensure Office is up to date. Malware sometimes exploits outdated software.\n   - Check for **recent Office installations or updates** that might have triggered this activity.\n\n4. **Check for Tampering**:\n   - Use **file integrity monitoring** tools (e.g., Windows File Integrity Monitor) to detect unauthorized changes to system files.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate process, the **high volume of identical\/minified JavaScript files** in the **OfflineFiles** directory warrants further investigation. This could be a **normal Office operation**, but it is also a potential **indicator of compromise** (e.g., malware masquerading as legitimate activity). Prioritize scanning the files and monitoring the system for additional suspicious behavior."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, looking at the data, most of the entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe, specifically JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. There are a couple of entries from Chrome as well, one about a registry value set.\n\nHmm. The first thing that stands out is the number of file creation events from SDXHelper.exe. There are about 14 entries where SDXHelper creates these .js files. The paths are all under the same directory, which is part of Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. Now, I know that SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, used for handling add-ins or solutions. But creating so many JavaScript files in that directory might be unusual. Typically, Office might generate some files, but 14 in a short period could indicate something.\n\nWait, but looking at the filenames, they all have the same pattern: officeaicopilot-strings.min.js with different hashes. Wait, but some entries have the same filename. For example, the 15th entry is min_e8258ccc... and then the 16th is the same again. That's odd. Maybe a duplicate log entry? Or maybe the process is creating the same file multiple times? That could be a sign of something wrong, like a loop or an error.\n\nAlso, there's a registry event from Chrome. But that's just one entry. Maybe that's normal. However, the rest are all from SDXHelper. Now, considering that these files are minified JavaScript, they might be part of an add-in or some office solution. But why so many? Maybe the user is working on a project that requires a lot of these files, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, it could be a sign of malicious activity, like a malware dropper creating multiple files. However, SDXHelper is a legitimate process, so that's confusing.\n\nAnother angle: the files are being created in the SolutionPackages directory. If this is part of a legitimate Office add-in deployment, maybe that's normal. But if the user isn't aware of such activity, it could be suspicious. Also, the repetition of the same filename might indicate a problem with the process, like a bug or an attack.\n\nBut I need to be careful. Just because there are many files doesn't automatically mean it's malicious. However, the combination of a high number of file creations, same filenames, and the process being SDXHelper (which is legitimate but could be exploited) might be a red flag. Also, the presence of a registry event from Chrome might be unrelated, but it's worth noting.\n\nIn conclusion, while some of this could be normal, the volume and repetition might indicate something unusual. Therefore, it's worth flagging as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"Interesting\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"The log shows 14 file creation events by SDXHelper.exe (a legitimate Office process) generating JavaScript files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. While SDXHelper is legitimate, the repetitive creation of identical filenames (e.g., `min_e8258ccc...js` appearing twice) and the sheer volume of files may indicate abnormal behavior. This could suggest either: 1) a benign but unusual Office add-in deployment, 2) a potential exploit where SDXHelper is being manipulated to generate malicious payloads, or 3) a log duplication error. The single Chrome-related registry event is less concerning but warrants contextual analysis. The pattern merits further investigation to rule out malicious activity.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the log entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's chrome.exe and SDXHelper.exe. Chrome is a common browser, so some of its activities might be normal, like loading DLLs from System32, such as urlmon.dll. That's part of Windows, so probably legitimate. But then there's SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The paths look a bit long and specific. Office typically uses those directories for add-ins or solutions, but creating multiple JS files with similar names might be a red flag. \n\nWait, the files are named officeaicopilot-strings.min_... with different hashes. The repetition of \"officeaicopilot\" might indicate something related to a specific add-in or extension. However, if these files are part of a legitimate Office solution, they might be normal. But the fact that they're being created by SDXHelper.exe, which isn't a standard Microsoft process, could be suspicious. SDXHelper isn't a known legitimate process, so that's a point against it.\n\nAlso, there are multiple entries of chrome.exe setting registry values. While Chrome does interact with the registry, repeated registry modifications could be part of normal operations or might indicate something else. However, the registry events here don't have specific details, so it's hard to tell without more context.\n\nAnother thing is the file streams created for the Excel file \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\". The Zone.Identifier streams are typically created when files are downloaded from the internet, marking them as coming from a different zone (like the internet) to trigger security warnings. That's normal, but the fact that there are multiple entries for the same file might be part of normal operations, like opening or saving the file.\n\nNow, the key points are the SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JS files in a non-standard location. If these files are part of a malicious payload, that could be a problem. However, without more data, like the content of the files or the behavior of SDXHelper.exe, it's hard to confirm. But the presence of multiple file creations by an unknown process in a specific directory is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n\nConfidence-wise, since there are multiple events involving SDXHelper.exe and the files created in the Office directory, which is a common place for add-ins, but the process name isn't standard, I'd lean towards \"interesting\" but not conclusive. So maybe a medium to high confidence that this is worth looking into.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events includes several activities that warrant further investigation due to potential anomalies:\n\n1. **Unusual Process Activity**:  \n   - **SDXHelper.exe** (not a standard Microsoft process) is repeatedly creating JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`) in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. While Office may use this directory for add-ins, the repetitive creation of files with similar names and hash-like suffixes raises suspicion. This could indicate malicious payload deployment or unauthorized add-in activity.\n\n2. **Legitimate vs. Suspicious DLL Loads**:  \n   - **Chrome.exe** loading `urlmon.dll` (a legitimate Windows system DLL) is normal. However, repeated entries for the same DLL might be benign or could indicate tampering, though no immediate red flags are present here.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:  \n   - Multiple **Chrome.exe** registry writes (`Registry value set`) are logged. While Chrome interacts with the registry, the lack of specific details (e.g., keys\/values modified) makes it hard to assess risk. This could be normal behavior or part of a larger pattern requiring deeper analysis.\n\n4. **Zone.Identifier Streams**:  \n   - **Chrome.exe** creating `Zone.Identifier` streams for the Excel file `Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx` is typical for downloaded files. However, the repeated entries for the same file might suggest repeated interactions (e.g., opening, saving), which could be benign or indicative of tampering.\n\n### **Conclusion**:  \nThe **SDXHelper.exe** activity is the most concerning due to its non-standard nature and the context of file creation in a directory associated with Office add-ins. This warrants further investigation (e.g., checking the files’ contents, analyzing SDXHelper.exe’s behavior, and correlating with network or user activity). While not definitively malicious, the combination of unusual process behavior and repetitive file creation suggests this is **interesting for investigation**.\n\n**Confidence Level**: Medium-High (requires deeper analysis to confirm benignity or malicious intent)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path looks a bit odd. Office usually doesn't generate JavaScript files in those locations, especially with names like \"word_88b086261de1446381728f2f003dad876baa5ace5feab65b3fba352ef7fab4c6.js\". The long, random-looking filename might be a red flag. Maybe it's a malicious file being dropped there.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events from EXCEL.EXE loading system DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so loading them isn't necessarily bad. But the fact that Excel is loading so many different DLLs might be normal for its operations. However, the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender could be part of normal antivirus operations, but I need to check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event from EXCEL.EXE. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious. The other events involve SDXHelper.exe creating more JavaScript files in similar paths. The filenames have different language codes (af-za, am-et, ar-sa, as-in), which might indicate localization files. But why would SDXHelper.exe be creating so many of these? Maybe it's part of a legitimate Office update or package, but the sheer number and the specific paths might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, so it's a legitimate process. However, if it's creating multiple files in the SolutionPackages directory, that might be unusual. Also, the presence of HxTsr.exe modifying the registry could be a concern. HxTsr.exe is part of the HP software, but if it's making registry changes, that might be normal for some HP components. However, without knowing the exact changes, it's hard to say.\n\nThe main red flags here are the multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in non-standard locations with unusual filenames. The fact that these files are JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory is suspicious. Legitimate Office packages might have resources, but JavaScript files in such paths aren't typical. This could indicate that the process is being used to drop malicious payloads or that there's a compromise.\n\nAdditionally, the repeated FileCreate events for different language-specific UI strings might be an attempt to obfuscate the real purpose of the files. The combination of these file creations and the registry changes by HxTsr.exe could point to a larger malicious activity, such as a backdoor or data exfiltration.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these events could be part of normal Office operations, especially if the user has been using certain add-ins or has had recent updates. But given the patterns observed—unusual file paths, multiple file creations, and registry modifications—it's more likely that this is worth investigating further. The presence of JavaScript files in those directories is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity, even if the processes involved are legitimate. Therefore, this batch of events seems interesting and warrants a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion**\n1. **Unusual File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`**:\n   - Multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `word_88b086261de1446381728f2f003dad876baa5ace5feab65b3fba352ef7fab4c6.js`) are created in the **Office SolutionPackages directory**. \n   - These files have **randomized, obfuscated filenames** and are located in a directory typically associated with **Microsoft Office resources**, which is **unusual** for JavaScript files. This could indicate **malicious payload delivery** or **tampering**.\n\n2. **Language-Specific UI String Files**:\n   - The files include language-specific prefixes (e.g., `af-za`, `am-et`, `ar-sa`, `as-in`), suggesting **localization assets**. However, the **volume and randomness** of these files raise concerns about **potential obfuscation** or **malicious content disguised as legitimate resources**.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications by `HxTsr.exe`**:\n   - While `HxTsr.exe` is a legitimate HP utility, **registry changes** without clear context could indicate **tampering** or **malicious configuration**.\n\n4. **`EXCEL.EXE` Interacting with Temporary Files**:\n   - A file stream is created in a **temporary directory** (`Packages\\oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_2bd7\\AC\\Temp`). While normal for Excel, this could be a **red flag** if the file contains **suspicious data** (e.g., embedded malicious code).\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting**\n- **Legitimate Processes Doing Unusual Things**: \n  - `SDXHelper.exe` (a legitimate Office helper) and `EXCEL.EXE` are creating files in **non-standard locations** with **unusual filenames**, which is **atypical** for their normal operations.\n- **Potential for Malware Delivery**: \n  - The JavaScript files in the Office directory could be **malicious scripts** (e.g., **exploits**, **data exfiltration tools**) or **components of a larger attack chain**.\n- **Lack of Context**: \n  - No clear benign purpose is evident for the files or registry changes. This **absence of justification** increases the risk of **malicious activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Analyze the Created Files**: \n  - Use tools like **YARA rules**, **sandboxing**, or **static analysis** to check for **malware signatures** in the JavaScript files.\n- **Monitor `SDXHelper.exe` and `HxTsr.exe`**: \n  - Investigate the **registry changes** made by `HxTsr.exe` and ensure they are **legitimate**.\n- **Check for Unusual Network Activity**: \n  - If these processes are communicating with **external IPs** or **unusual domains**, it could confirm **malicious behavior**.\n- **Review User Activity**: \n  - Determine if the user has **recently installed untrusted software**, **visited malicious websites**, or **opened suspicious documents**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of events shows **highly suspicious behavior** that is **not aligned with the expected operations** of the involved processes. The **creation of obfuscated JavaScript files** in Office directories, combined with **registry modifications**, strongly suggests the need for **further investigation** to rule out **malware infection** or **compromise**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events where EXCEL.EXE is creating file streams, specifically for a file named 1680A406.xlsx with a Zone.Identifier. Zone.Identifier is typically used by Windows to mark files as coming from the internet, which triggers the \"blocked\" icon. But creating a Zone.Identifier stream might be part of normal operations, like when a file is downloaded. However, seeing it multiple times could be suspicious if it's part of some malicious activity, like trying to bypass security measures.\n\nThen there's an entry about EXCEL.EXE loading coml2.dll. That's a legitimate system file, so maybe that's normal. But I should check if there are any unusual aspects here. The path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\coml2.dll, which is standard, so probably not an issue.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe is creating several files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames look like they could be part of Office add-ins or language packs. However, the repetition of some files (like the bg-bg-ui-strings-json file appearing twice) might be a red flag. Also, the presence of multiple files being created in that directory could indicate that something is trying to install or configure an add-in, which might be legitimate, but could also be part of a malicious payload.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so this might just be a user configuring it. But if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of someone setting up a new monitoring tool, which isn't inherently malicious but might be part of a broader investigation.\n\nLooking at the Registry value set events by EXCEL.EXE and Explorer.EXE. Multiple registry changes by EXCEL.EXE could be concerning. Excel might be modifying its own settings, but if it's changing other registry keys, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being modified, so it's hard to say without more context.\n\nPutting this all together: the creation of Zone.Identifier streams, multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in Office directories, and numerous registry changes by Excel. While some of these could be normal, the repetition and the specific directories involved might warrant further investigation. The presence of SDXHelper.exe, which isn't a standard Microsoft process, might be a point of concern. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate Office add-in or a tool being used by the user, but without more information, it's hard to tell. However, given the number of events and the directories involved, it's on the edge of suspicious. I'd lean towards marking this as interesting for investigation to check if there's any unauthorized activity or if these processes are behaving normally.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Excel.EXE Activity:**\n   - **Zone.Identifier Streams:** Multiple instances of `EXCEL.EXE` creating `Zone.Identifier` streams for a file (`1680A406.xlsx`). This is typically used by Windows to mark files as originating from the internet (triggering the \"blocked\" icon). While normal in some contexts (e.g., file downloads), repeated creation could indicate attempts to bypass security measures or tamper with file attributes.\n   - **Registry Modifications:** `EXCEL.EXE` is involved in numerous `Registry value set` events. While Excel may legitimately modify its own settings, the lack of specificity in the registry keys modified raises concerns. Unusual registry changes could signal persistence mechanisms or configuration tampering.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.EXE File Creations:**\n   - **Office SolutionPackages Directory:** `SDXHelper.EXE` creates multiple files in `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`, including language-specific bundles (e.g., `bundle_1fe8fdf08a76d34524f5d50f471c45e8.js`). While this could be part of a legitimate Office add-in or localization package, the repetition of files (e.g., `bg-bg-ui-strings-json` appearing twice) and the lack of clear context (e.g., no associated installation logs) suggests potential for misuse, such as embedding malicious payloads in add-ins.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat.EXE Activity:**\n   - A single event shows `winlogbeat.exe` creating a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory. While `winlogbeat` is a legitimate log-shipping tool, this activity could indicate a user configuring it or, in a compromised system, an attacker setting up data exfiltration.\n\n4. **Explorer.EXE and Excel.EXE Registry Events:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events by `Explorer.EXE` and `Excel.EXE` could reflect normal operations (e.g., updates, user preferences). However, without context on the specific registry keys modified, this remains ambiguous and merits deeper inspection.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low-Moderate Risk:** The majority of activities (e.g., Excel operations, Winlogbeat file creation) are consistent with legitimate user behavior. However, the **repetition of file creations by SDXHelper.EXE** and the **unusual registry modifications by Excel.EXE** introduce potential risks.\n- **Red Flags:** \n  - Lack of context for `SDXHelper.EXE` activity (not a standard Microsoft process).\n  - Multiple `Zone.Identifier` stream creations, which could be used to evade security controls.\n  - Unspecified registry changes by Excel, which may indicate tampering or persistence.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate SDXHelper.EXE:** \n   - Confirm if `SDXHelper.EXE` is part of a legitimate Office add-in or third-party tool. Check its digital signature, file path, and parent processes.\n   - Analyze the created files (e.g., `bundle_*.js`) for malicious content (e.g., embedded scripts, obfuscation).\n\n2. **Audit Excel.EXE Registry Modifications:**\n   - Identify the specific registry keys modified by `Excel.EXE`. Look for changes to keys related to security policies, startup entries, or user preferences.\n\n3. **Monitor Winlogbeat.EXE:**\n   - Verify if the `.yml.new` file is part of a legitimate configuration. Check for unexpected network activity or data exfiltration related to `winlogbeat`.\n\n4. **Check for Anomalies:**\n   - Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., network traffic, process tree analysis) to determine if they align with known benign behavior or indicate compromise.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile no definitive malicious activity is confirmed, the combination of **unusual file operations**, **repetitive events**, and **ambiguous registry changes** warrants **further investigation**. These could indicate either benign but unmonitored tools or early signs of compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, mostly from Excel and SDXHelper.exe. The first thing I notice is that there are a lot of registry value set events from EXCEL.EXE. But then there are also several file creation events from SDXHelper.exe.\n\nHmm, Excel normally doesn't modify the registry much, especially multiple times. But maybe it's part of some add-in or macro? But wait, the file creation events are in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. That path seems familiar; it's where Office solutions and add-ins are stored. The files being created are JavaScript files, which might be part of a COM add-in or an Office Web App.\n\nWait, but the process is SDXHelper.exe. What's that? I'm not sure, but if it's a legitimate process, then maybe it's part of Office's package management. However, the repeated registry changes by Excel could be a red flag. But maybe they're just normal operations. However, when combined with the file creations in that specific directory, it might indicate something like a malicious add-in being deployed.\n\nAnother thing: the file names have hashes or unique identifiers in them, which is common for Office solutions. But the same file being created multiple times might be part of an update or installation. However, the presence of multiple registry modifications by Excel could be unusual. But I'm not certain. Maybe it's a legitimate scenario where Excel is being used to deploy an add-in, and SDXHelper is handling the file creation. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the combination of these events might be worth looking into further. So I think the classification should be INTERESTING, but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by EXCEL.EXE combined with SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in Office SolutionPackages directory suggests potential malicious add-in deployment or tampering. The pattern warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these log entries. The user provided a list of file creation events, mostly from the SDXHelper.exe process, with a couple from winlogbeat.exe. \n\nFirst, I notice that most of the files being created are in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. The filenames look like they're language-specific UI string files, such as \"da-dk-ui-strings-json_...\" and \"en-us-ui-strings-json_...\". These could be part of a normal Office update or localization process. However, the presence of multiple such files might indicate something more if they're not expected.\n\nThen there's the entry from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so this might be part of a configuration change. But that's a single event and might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nNow, looking at the timestamps and the number of events, if all these files were created in a short period, that could be a sign of a malicious activity, like a dropper or a downloader creating many files. However, without knowing the context of when these events occurred, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother thing to check is the process names. SDXHelper.exe is mentioned multiple times. I should verify if this is a legitimate process. A quick search shows that SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the setup and updates. So, if these files are part of a legitimate update, then it's normal. But if the user hasn't initiated an update and these files are being created unexpectedly, that could be a red flag.\n\nAlso, the filenames have a pattern with language codes and random strings. If the random strings are hashes or unique identifiers, that's normal for updates. However, if they look like random garbage or have suspicious extensions, that might be a problem. But in this case, they are .js and .json files, which are common for configuration and localization.\n\nThe only potentially suspicious entry is the winlogbeat one, but that's a known tool. Unless there's other activity related to it, like unexpected network connections or other processes, it might not be an issue.\n\nIn conclusion, without more context like the time frame of these events, user activity, or other logs, it's hard to determine if this is malicious. However, the majority of these events seem to be related to legitimate Office operations. The user should check if they recently updated Office or installed something that might be causing this. If not, further investigation into the SDXHelper.exe process and the files created would be necessary.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries primarily involve the creation of files by the **SDXHelper.exe** process (associated with Microsoft Office) and a single event from **winlogbeat.exe** (a log shipping tool). Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Activity**:\n   - **File Creation**: Over 15 entries show file creation in the directory:\n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\<hash>\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n     ```\n     The files are named with language-specific UI strings (e.g., `da-dk-ui-strings-json_...`, `en-us-ui-strings-json_...`), which are typical for **Office localization or updates**.\n   - **Legitimacy**: SDXHelper.exe is a **legitimate Microsoft Office process** responsible for managing updates and installations. The file names suggest **language-specific resources**, which align with normal Office operations.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat.exe Activity**:\n   - A single event shows the creation of a `.yml.new` file in the **Downloads directory**:\n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new\n     ```\n     This appears to be part of a **configuration change** for Winlogbeat, a legitimate log shipper. No immediate suspicious behavior is evident here.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Volume of Activity**: While the files appear legitimate, the **high number of file creations** in a short timeframe (if clustered) could indicate **unexpected behavior**, such as:\n  - **Malware dropper activity** (e.g., generating files for payload delivery).\n  - **Office update tampering** (e.g., malicious files masquerading as legitimate resources).\n- **Lack of Context**: Without timestamps or correlation with user activity (e.g., recent Office updates, installations, or downloads), it is difficult to assess whether this is normal or anomalous.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Office Updates**:\n   - Check if the user recently installed Office updates or localized versions. If not, investigate further.\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals** to trace the source of file creation.\n\n2. **Inspect File Contents**:\n   - Examine the contents of the generated `.json` files to ensure they match expected **localization data** (e.g., no unexpected binary data or obfuscated code).\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Look for **unusual network activity** from SDXHelper.exe (e.g., connections to unknown domains).\n   - Check for **additional processes** or files in the `SolutionPackages` directory that may not be accounted for.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Configuration**:\n   - Ensure the `.yml.new` file is part of a **legitimate configuration update** and not a result of tampering.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity appears **primarily legitimate**, consistent with **Microsoft Office update operations**. However, the **high volume of file creations** and lack of contextual information (e.g., timestamps, user activity) warrant further investigation to rule out **malicious activity** or **unexpected behavior**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first set of events, there are multiple entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like \"hu-hu-ui-strings-json\" and \"en-us_web\\\\fabric.js\". These look like localization files or resources, possibly part of an Office add-in or solution package. The paths are all under the user's AppData folder, which is common for user-specific data. However, the fact that so many files are being created by SDXHelper.exe might be normal if it's part of a legitimate Office process, but I need to check if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nThen there are events related to EXCEL.EXE performing DNS queries and registry changes. DNS queries could be normal if the application is connecting to a server, but combined with registry changes, it might indicate some configuration changes. However, the registry events are also happening with svchost.exe, which is a standard Windows process that hosts various system services. Those events might be part of normal system operations, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, looking at the SDXHelper.exe files again. The names of the files created are all UI string resources for different languages. This could be part of a legitimate installation or update process for an Office add-in. However, the repetition of multiple similar files might be a red flag if they are being created in an unusual quantity or if the process is not expected to be doing that. Also, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, specifically used for managing solutions and add-ins. So, if it's part of a legitimate Office installation, then creating these files might be normal. But if it's not, that could be a problem.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the presence of both file creation events and registry changes. If SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of files and modifying the registry, that might be part of a larger process, but if it's doing so without user interaction or in a way that's not typical, that could be suspicious. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious activity like downloading files from the internet or executing scripts.\n\nThe EXCEL.EXE events are a bit concerning. DNS queries are normal, but if they're pointing to unusual domains, that would be a problem. But the logs don't specify the domains queried. Similarly, the registry changes might be part of a legitimate update or configuration change. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, the majority of the events are related to SDXHelper.exe creating resource files for Office, which might be normal. However, the combination of multiple file creations and registry changes by different processes could indicate either normal activity or something more nefarious. Since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, I should consider that while some of these activities are normal, the volume and the processes involved might warrant further examination. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate Office update, but without more information, it's safer to flag it as potentially interesting for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events includes a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation:**\n   - **Legitimate Context:** `SDXHelper.exe` is associated with Microsoft Office and is used for managing solution packages (e.g., `.xll` add-ins). The files created (e.g., `hu-hu-ui-strings-json`, `fabric.js`) resemble localization\/resource files for Office add-ins, which could be part of a legitimate update or installation.\n   - **Red Flags:** \n     - **High Volume:** Multiple files are created in the `SolutionPackages` directory, which may be unusual if not tied to a known Office process.\n     - **Lack of User Context:** No user interaction or installation event is mentioned, which could indicate automated or unexpected behavior.\n\n2. **Registry and DNS Activity:**\n   - **EXCEL.EXE DNS Query:** A DNS query by `EXCEL.EXE` is normal if the application is communicating with a legitimate server. However, the lack of domain details makes it hard to assess risk.\n   - **svchost.exe Registry Changes:** While `svchost.exe` is a standard system process, frequent registry modifications (e.g., \"object added\/deleted\") could indicate tampering or configuration changes, especially if tied to unknown services.\n\n3. **Process Behavior:**\n   - The combination of `SDXHelper.exe` file creation and `EXCEL.EXE`\/`svchost.exe` registry\/DNS activity could suggest a larger process (e.g., Office update), but the absence of clear user-initiated actions or logging context raises concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Verdict: Interesting for Investigation**\n- **Why?** While some activity (e.g., `SDXHelper.exe` creating Office-related files) may be legitimate, the **lack of contextual details** (e.g., user action, domain information, installation logs) and the **unusual volume of file creation** warrant further analysis. \n- **Next Steps:** \n  - Correlate with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to determine if the DNS queries or registry changes are part of a known Office process.\n  - Check if `SDXHelper.exe` is signed by Microsoft and verify its location (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office`).\n  - Investigate the domains involved in the DNS queries for `EXCEL.EXE`.\n\n**Conclusion:** This activity is **not definitively malicious**, but the lack of context and unusual patterns make it **interesting for further investigation** to rule out potential threats."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, mostly about Excel.EXE and SDXHelper.exe. The first thing I notice is that there are a lot of entries where Excel.EXE is setting registry values. But then there are a few entries where SDXHelper.exe is creating files in specific directories under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages.\n\nHmm, so the majority of the logs are Excel.EXE doing registry stuff. But why is that a problem? Well, Excel is a legitimate application, and modifying the registry isn't inherently malicious. However, if it's doing this repeatedly, maybe there's something off. But then again, maybe it's part of normal operations, like updates or add-ins.\n\nThen there's SDXHelper.exe creating files. The filenames look like they're related to Office solutions, like \"PackageResources\" and \"OfflineFiles\". The paths are in the user's AppData, which is common for temporary files or application data. But why are these files being created? SDXHelper.exe might be part of an Office add-in or a tool used by Office. But the fact that it's creating multiple JavaScript files in those directories could be normal, especially if it's part of a package deployment.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if this batch is interesting for investigation. The key here is to look for anomalies. The first 20 entries are all Excel.EXE setting registry values. That's a lot. But if that's part of a normal process, maybe not. However, if there's no other suspicious activity, maybe not. But then there are the SDXHelper.exe entries. Are those normal?\n\nAlso, the filenames have hashes in them, like \"36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b\" and \"f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2\". Those look like unique identifiers for specific packages. That might be normal for Office solutions, which often use unique IDs for different versions or components. However, if these files are being created in a way that's not typical, that could be a red flag.\n\nBut I also need to consider the number of events. The majority are Excel.EXE registry changes. If Excel is modifying the registry multiple times, maybe that's part of a legitimate process. However, if the registry changes are to specific keys that are known to be exploited, that could be a problem. But the logs don't specify which registry keys are being modified. Without more details, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother angle: SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the SolutionPackages directory. That directory is used by Office for storing solution packages, so that's normal. However, if the files being created are not expected, like executable files or other types that aren't part of the package, that could be suspicious. But in the logs, they're JavaScript files, which are common in web-based Office add-ins.\n\nPutting this all together: The logs show a mix of normal Office-related activities. The repeated registry changes by Excel might be part of a legitimate process, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The SDXHelper.exe file creations seem to be part of package deployment. However, the sheer number of events and the lack of obvious malicious indicators (like unusual file types or registry keys) makes me think this might not be a security incident. But maybe the user is concerned because of the volume of events. Alternatively, if these events are part of a larger pattern that's not shown here, it could be more concerning. But based solely on the provided logs, there's not enough evidence to flag this as suspicious. However, the presence of multiple registry changes and file creations by different processes might warrant further investigation to confirm they are legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries reflect a mix of normal and potentially benign activities related to Microsoft Office applications. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Excel.EXE Registry Modifications**:\n   - **Frequency**: 20+ entries of `Excel.EXE` modifying registry values. While frequent registry changes can sometimes indicate malicious behavior (e.g., persistence mechanisms), **Excel itself is a legitimate application** that interacts with the registry during normal operations (e.g., add-in management, configuration updates).\n   - **Lack of Specificity**: The logs do not specify which registry keys are being modified. Without context (e.g., suspicious keys like `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`), these changes are **not inherently malicious**.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.exe File Creations**:\n   - **File Paths**: Files are created in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`, a directory commonly used by **Office add-ins and solutions** for storing temporary or deployment-related files.\n   - **File Types**: The files are JavaScript (`.js`) and JSON (`.json`), which are typical for **web-based Office add-ins** or localization assets. The filenames include hashes (e.g., `36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b`), which may correspond to **specific package versions or identifiers**.\n   - **No Malicious Indicators**: No executable files (`.exe`, `.dll`) or suspicious file types are present.\n\n### **Risk Assessment**\n- **Low to Moderate Risk**: The activities observed are **consistent with legitimate Office operations** (e.g., add-in deployment, language packs). However, the **high volume of registry changes** by `Excel.EXE` could warrant further investigation to confirm they are expected behavior.\n- **No Clear Malicious Activity**: No red flags (e.g., unknown processes, unusual file types, or suspicious registry keys) are present in the logs.\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Additional Context**:\n   - Check if the registry changes by `Excel.EXE` are tied to known Office processes (e.g., updates, add-ins) or if they involve unusual keys.\n   - Verify if `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate component (e.g., part of an Office add-in or Microsoft tool).\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - If `Excel.EXE` is modifying **uncommon registry keys** or if `SDXHelper.exe` is creating **unexpected file types**, investigate further.\n   - Look for **unusual process behavior** (e.g., network connections, elevated privileges) not captured in the logs.\n\n3. **User Education**:\n   - Ensure users are aware of **phishing risks** or **malicious add-ins** that could trigger such activity indirectly.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs do **not indicate a clear security threat**. The observed activities align with **normal Office operations**, but the high frequency of registry changes by `Excel.EXE` merits closer scrutiny in the broader context of system behavior. No immediate action is required unless further anomalies are detected."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look at these events. So, there are five entries here, all from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. Each one is a file creation event under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and some random strings, like mk-mk-ui-strings-json followed by a hash. \n\nHmm, first thought: SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. I know that Office has some helper tools, but I'm not sure if this is one of them. The file paths are in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages folder. That seems a bit odd because typically, user-specific files might be in AppData, but SolutionPackages might be part of Office's installation or updates.\n\nThe files being created are all JavaScript files with names that look like they could be localization files (the language codes like mk-mk, ml-in, etc.). But the hashes in the filenames are unique, which might indicate they're specific to some package. However, the same file is listed twice (the mr-in one appears twice). Maybe that's a duplicate entry, but not sure yet.\n\nNow, considering the process name. SDXHelper.exe isn't something I recognize as a legitimate Microsoft process. Legitimate processes usually have more standard names. Also, creating multiple files in the SolutionPackages directory might be part of a package deployment or update, but if this is happening frequently or without user consent, it could be malicious.\n\nAnother angle: the use of the FileCreate rule in the winlog task. If this is part of a normal Office operation, why would it trigger a FileCreate event? Maybe it's part of a package being installed or updated. However, the fact that all these files are being created by the same process in the same directory might be suspicious. Malware sometimes creates files in temporary or user-specific directories to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, the filenames have a pattern that includes language codes and a hash. That could be part of a legitimate localization package, but the repetition of the same hash in two entries might be a red flag. Maybe the same file was created twice, which could be an error or intentional.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is known to be malicious. If it's not a known legitimate process, that's a point against. Also, the directory path is under SolutionPackages, which might be used by Office for add-ins or solutions. However, the presence of multiple JavaScript files with unique hashes might be part of a larger package, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nConsidering all this, the combination of an unusual process name, creation of multiple files in a specific directory with suspicious filenames, and the repetition of the same file might indicate a potential security issue. However, without additional information like process parent, user context, or other related events, it's a bit tricky. But given the data here, it's leaning towards being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files with language-specific names and unique hashes are created by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard Office directory.
