{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a step-by-step breakdown of the malicious activity:\n\n1. **Initial Infection (unknown source)**\n   - An unknown process started the `services.exe` process.\n\n2. **Possible Evasion Technique**\n   - `sppsvc.exe` loaded the task scheduler DLL (`taskschd.dll`), which could indicate an attempt to hide its activity by impersonating a legitimate Windows service.\n\n3. **Command Execution**\n   - The `powershell.exe` process executed commands that accessed other processes:\n     1. Accessed `whoami.exe`.\n     2. Accessed itself multiple times.\n     3. Executed the command: `& {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}`, which deleted all files with the name `entrada_principal.zip` in the temporary folder.\n\n4. **Image Loading**\n   - The `powershell.exe` process loaded several DLLs, including:\n     1. `mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, and `clr.dll`.\n     2. Native images for mscorlib and System.Management.Automation.\n     3. `MpOAV.dll` from the Windows Defender directory.\n\n5. **Script Creation and Deletion**\n   - `powershell.exe` created a script file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`.\n   - Immediately afterwards, it deleted the same script file.\n\nThis sequence of events suggests that an unknown malicious process initially compromised the system. It then executed PowerShell commands to perform various actions, including deleting a potentially malicious ZIP file and creating\/deleting a script. The loaded DLLs might indicate that the attacker is using .NET-related tools or techniques for their payload."}
