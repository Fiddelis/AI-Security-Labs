Further investigation is recommended to determine if any unauthorized services were created and whether the `tarefa_logico.exe` file is legitimate or malware in disguise.\n\nTo investigate further:\n- Check if the \"objeto\\_ativo\" service was actually created.\n- Inspect the `tarefa_logico.exe` file using an anti-virus scanner or online service to determine its legitimacy.\n- Monitor for any unusual behavior related to this service or the mentioned files and directories."}
