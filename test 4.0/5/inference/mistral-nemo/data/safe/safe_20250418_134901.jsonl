{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided JSON logs, here's a summary of the events that occurred on the Windows system:\n\n1. **Winlogbeat Process and File Events:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` was started.\n   - It created a new file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`.\n   - Winlogbeat process exited and then restarted several times, with the same file creation event logged each time.\n\n2. **System Processes and File Events:**\n   - `sppsvc.exe` loaded the image `taskschd.dll`.\n   - `svchost.exe` set registry values multiple times.\n   - `notepad.exe` loaded the image `urlmon.dll`.\n   - `chrome.exe` performed several DNS queries and set registry values multiple times.\n   - `Calculator.exe` set a registry value.\n   - `setup.exe` created a temporary file at `C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp\\b8d633a2-08f3-4e51-85c3-3602fa580c63.tmp`.\n\n3. **Winlog Events:**\n   - Several \"None\" events were logged.\n   - One event was logged as \"User Account Management\".\n   - Multiple events related to registry changes and image loading were logged, primarily involving system processes like `svchost.exe` and user applications like `chrome.exe`.\n   - Dns query events were logged when `chrome.exe` was running.\n\n4. **General Observations:**\n   - The system seems active with various processes interacting with the registry and files.\n   - Winlogbeat process was repeatedly starting and stopping, which might indicate an issue or configuration problem with winlogbeat service.\n   - The presence of a setup executable (`setup.exe`) suggests that software installation or update activities were happening on the system.\n\nTo investigate further, you should analyze these events in context with other relevant logs, such as security and network logs. Also, consider checking the system's overall health and stability, especially regarding the winlogbeat service behavior."}
