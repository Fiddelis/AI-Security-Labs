{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of the suspicious activity:\n\n1. **Initial Infection:**\n   - A user named `fiddelis` opened an email with an attachment named `entrada_principal.zip`. The email had a malicious macro that executed when the archive was opened.\n   - The macro spawned `powershell.exe`, which then executed a command to remove the original zip file from the temp folder.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - PowerShell loaded several native images and .NET assemblies, indicating it's running a script or executing commands.\n   - It created a temporary script file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`.\n   - Immediately after creating the file, PowerShell deleted it.\n\n3. **Additional Processes:**\n   - Before the PowerShell activity, there were other processes observed:\n     - `services.exe`: A Windows system process.\n     - `sppsvc.exe` (Windows Update service): Loaded `taskschd.dll`.\n     - `svchost.exe` (Host process for Windows Services): Set a registry value.\n\n4. **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - The malicious zip file: `entrada_principal.zip`\n   - The temporary script file created and deleted by PowerShell: `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`\n\nBased on these logs, it's recommended to:\n\n- Isolate the affected system.\n- Scan the system with up-to-date antivirus software.\n- Review group policy objects (GPOs) and user privileges related to PowerShell execution policies.\n- Implement email filtering to prevent similar attacks in the future.\n- Consider using application whitelisting to prevent unknown or unsigned scripts from running."}
