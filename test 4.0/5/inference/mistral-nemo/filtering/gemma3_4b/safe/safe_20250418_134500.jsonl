The complex command line could be due to various flags, parameters, or configuration options required by the updater process.\n\nHowever, as always, it's essential to analyze such events in the broader context of your system's security and performance. If you have any concerns about the legitimacy of these activities, consider using reliable security tools or consulting with a security professional for further analysis."}
