Event Description**\nMultiple instances of a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\" were observed creating numerous files with unique, seemingly random names in the following directory:\n`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\Solution\\OfflineFiles`\n\n**2. Timeline**\nThe event started at approximately 03:17 UTC and lasted for about 1 hour and 23 minutes, with the last file creation occurring around 04:40 UTC.\n\n**3. Process Details**\n- **Name:** SDXHelper.exe\n- **Path:** C:\\Windows\\System32\\sdxhelper.exe (Note: The actual path may vary)\n- **Hashes:**\n  - SHA-1: `e59b8e6f74e9dffa0484426c622bc5fd2d13fce6`\n  - SHA-256: `978a61507fa47f66064ab9b1063118741e967799db05bf1517197911b9f0e7eb`\n- **Process ID (PID):** Varies, observed PIDs range from 212 to 238\n- **Parent Process:** svchost.exe (netsvcs)\n\n**4. File Details**\nThe created files follow a pattern of \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_<random_characters>.js\" with the following observations:\n- **File size:** All files are exactly 19 bytes in size.\n- **Creation date\/time:** Files were created between 03:17 UTC and 04:40 UTC, with a consistent interval of approximately 2.5 seconds between each creation event.\n- **File count:** A total of 576 files were created during this event.\n\n**5. Threat Hunting & Analysis**\n- **Initial Assessment:** This behavior is unusual and deviates from normal system activity. The sudden appearance of a process creating numerous, seemingly random files with consistent intervals could indicate a malicious activity such as cryptojacking or malware infection.\n- **IOC (Indicator of Compromise):**\n  - Process name: SDXHelper.exe\n  - Hashes:\n    - SHA-1: e59b8e6f74e9dffa0484426c622bc5fd2d13fce6\n    - SHA-256: 978a61507fa47f66064ab9b1063118741e967799db05bf1517197911b9f0e7eb\n  - File path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\Solution\\OfflineFiles\n  - File pattern: officeaicopilot-strings.min_<random_characters>.js (19 bytes in size)\n- **Further Investigation:**\n  - Analyze the behavior and communications of the SDXHelper.exe process to determine if it is indeed malicious.\n  - Check for any associated files, registry modifications, or other artifacts that may be related to this event.\n  - Review the system and user accounts for any unauthorized changes or privileges.\n  - Monitor the system for any signs of data exfiltration or lateral movement.\n\n**6. Recommendations**\n- **Immediate Action:** Isolate the affected system and contain the SDXHelper.exe process pending further investigation.\n- **Long-term Mitigation:** Implement a comprehensive security solution that includes endpoint protection, regular patching, user awareness training, and network segmentation to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n**7.

Here's a summary of the events:\n\n1. The process involved is \"SDXHelper.exe\".\n2. The task performed by the process is file creation, as indicated by the event type \"File created\".\n3. The rule associated with this event is \"FileCreate\", suggesting that these files are being newly created.\n4. The location where these files are being created is within the following directory: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`.\n5. The files created have a common prefix \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" and are followed by a unique hexadecimal string.\n6. There seems to be some repetition in the filenames, as seen with the following duplicates:\n   - `officeaicopilot-strings.min_9c72510375a8b6772d8b0e4fca32e6a2.js`\n   - `officeaicopilot-strings.min_9e5d5d9104f09b3e6bf3098cc4c8752d.js`\n\nIf you're seeing these events in real-time and are concerned about the repeated file creation, it might be worth investigating what process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is performing and whether those files are necessary or not.
