However, this requires further investigation.\n- The numerous registry value sets by both `svchost.exe` and `chrome.exe` could indicate unusual behavior or possible malware activity.\n\nTo investigate these concerns further:\n\n- Monitor the `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file for any unexpected changes or actions.\n- Keep an eye on the activities of `smartscreen.exe`, `SDXHelper.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `chrome.exe`.\n- Review any related logs, such as those involving network connections, to see if they correlate with these events.\n- Consider using threat intelligence platforms to look up the processes and files involved in these events to determine if they are associated with known malicious activity."}
