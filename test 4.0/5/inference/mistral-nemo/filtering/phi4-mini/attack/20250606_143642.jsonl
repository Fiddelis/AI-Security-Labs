{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided data, here's a timeline of events and potential malicious activities:\n\n1. **Initial Process Creation**\n   - `sppsvc.exe` (Service Control Manager) loads `taskschd.dll`, which suggests that it might be interacting with scheduled tasks.\n\n2. **Registry Value Set**\n   - A registry value is set by an unknown process (`svchost.exe`). This could indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms being put in place.\n\n3. **PowerShell Activity**\n   - `powershell.exe` accesses other processes several times:\n     1. Accesses `sppsvc.exe`\n     2. Accesses another unknown process (not specified)\n     These accesses might suggest command and control communication or data exfiltration attempts.\n\n4. **Whoami Execution**\n   - `whoami.exe` is run from PowerShell, which could indicate an attempt to enumerate the current user's privileges.\n\n5. **File Deletion**\n   - PowerShell runs a script that deletes all files in the temp directory (`$env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip`). This action could be an attempt to remove artifacts or evidence of malicious activity.\n     ```\n     & {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}\n     ```\n\n6. **DLL Loading**\n   - PowerShell loads several DLLs:\n     1. `mscoree.dll`: Used for hosting the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in managed code.\n     2. `clr.dll`: Part of the .NET runtime.\n   These loads might indicate that PowerShell is executing managed code or loading a plugin.\n\nGiven these activities, it's likely that this sequence involves malicious behavior, such as:\n\n- Information gathering (`whoami.exe`)\n- Evidence cleanup (deleting temp files)\n- Execution of malicious scripts or payloads (PowerShell activity with DLL loading)\n\nIt would be prudent to investigate further and consider containment measures. Additional analysis tools like Process Monitor, PowerSploit, or other threat hunting techniques could provide more context."}
