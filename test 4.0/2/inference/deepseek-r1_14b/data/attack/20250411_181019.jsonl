{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is being accessed. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. Then there's whoami.exe, which is generally harmless but could be part of some reconnaissance.\n\nLooking further, I see several instances where cmd.exe and sc.exe are being used with command lines that create services. The paths mentioned in the command line look suspicious because they're referencing non-existing scripts like NonExistingScript.ps1. This seems like an attempt to execute malicious code by creating a service that runs a script which doesn't exist, possibly to evade detection.\n\nThere's also a lot of registry activity from various processes like services.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and RuntimeBroker.exe.频繁的注册表操作可能表明有恶意软件试图持久化，或者进行其他恶意配置。\n\nNotably, calc.exe is loading urlmon.dll, which isn't typical for such a benign process. This could indicate that even common tools are being used in unexpected ways, possibly to hide malicious activity.\n\nIn total, the combination of PowerShell usage, creation of services with suspicious scripts, multiple registry modifications, and atypical DLL loads all point towards potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events show several red flags: repeated use of PowerShell, attempts to create services using cmd.exe with suspicious script paths, and numerous registry modifications. These activities suggest possible malicious intent.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activity including PowerShell usage, service creation with non-existing scripts, frequent registry changes, and atypical DLL loading.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that there are 18 events in total. The processes involved include winlogbeat.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe multiple times, and chrome.exe repeatedly. \n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. Since winlogbeat is typically an agent used for collecting logs, this seems normal as it's probably updating its configuration file. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are several events from ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe setting registry values. Both of these seem like they could be legitimate activities since these processes are part of Windows and often interact with the registry for various settings.\n\nNow, looking at powershell.exe: it has a few entries. One is setting a registry value and another is accessing a process. PowerShell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so while some actions can be malicious, others are routine. Setting registry values could be part of script execution but without more context, it's hard to say if it's suspicious.\n\nThe majority of the events (13) come from chrome.exe, mostly involving setting registry values and loading image files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Chrome is a common browser and these actions are typical for its operation, especially when dealing with plugins or extensions which might interact with system libraries.\n\nI should consider if any of these activities are anomalies. For example, multiple registry writes from the same process could be concerning, but in this case, it's spread across different processes like chrome.exe, Calculator.exe, etc., which doesn't immediately raise red flags. Also, the files loaded by chrome.exe are standard system files, not indicators of malware.\n\nAnother point is that there are no failed logon attempts, file deletions, or other high-risk activities typically associated with malicious behavior. Everything seems to be within normal operational parameters for a typical user's activity on their machine.\n\nWhile powershell.exe could potentially execute malicious scripts, without seeing any command-line arguments or signs of obfuscation, it's hard to classify these events as suspicious. Similarly, the repeated registry writes by chrome.exe don't seem out of place if they're part of normal operation or extension activities.\n\nIn summary, each individual event doesn't point towards malicious activity on its own. The combination doesn't reveal any patterns that are unusual or indicative of an attack. Therefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no compelling evidence of malicious behavior when considering all events together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as file creation by winlogbeat.exe, registry operations by various processes including Calculator.exe and chrome.exe, and legitimate image loading by chrome.exe. There is no indication of malicious behavior or anomalies in the logs.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
