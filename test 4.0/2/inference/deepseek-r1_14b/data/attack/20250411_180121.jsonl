{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections. That seems normal because Chrome often connects to the internet. But then, there's a switch to powershell.exe events which caught my attention. \n\nThe first powershell.exe event shows a command line that uses DownloadFile to fetch something from GitHub. That's a red flag because PowerShell downloading files from external sites can be malicious. Plus, creating and then deleting a script file in the TEMP directory is suspicious—it could indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code.\n\nLooking further, multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs suggest that powershell.exe might be loading modules or executing scripts, which isn't unusual but combined with the DownloadFile calls makes it more concerning. The repeated pattern of downloading files from different GitHub repositories under varying names like 'modulo_padrao.txt', 'entrada_comum.txt', etc., indicates potential ongoing malicious activities.\n\nThe fact that these events are spread out across multiple entries and involve different file paths and command lines adds to the suspicion. It looks like an attacker is trying to download several modules or components, possibly for a more significant attack chain. \n\nI'm also noticing that after downloading each file, there's no indication of whether it was executed or not, but the mere act of downloading from external sources via script in this context raises the alarm.\n\nOverall, while some events on their own might look benign, the combination points towards potential malicious behavior that could be worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including downloading files from external sources and creating\/ deleting temporary files, indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that involve downloading files from GitHub repositories. The URLs point to different paths under various usernames like estrutura_temporario, pacote_base, etc., all downloading LICENSE.txt files into the TEMP directory with varying filenames. This repeated use of PowerShell to download files could be a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools for malicious activities.\n\nThen there are events where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These seem related to process creation or termination, but combined with the file downloads, it's something to note. Also, one event shows 'File created (rule: FileCreate)' in the C:\\Users directory, which might indicate that a file was saved there—potentially malicious if it's part of an attack chain.\n\nThere are several events from chrome.exe setting registry values. While Chrome does modify the registry for various reasons, multiple such events could be suspicious, especially if they're not usual activities for the user.\n\nAnother event shows conhost.exe modifying the registry. Conhost is often used as a legitimate process but can also be abused in attacks, so that's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nI notice a DNS query event, which is common and usually not concerning on its own, but when combined with other events, it could indicate command-and-control communication or data exfiltration.\n\nLastly, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so unless the system is misconfigured, this might not be malicious, but it's worth checking if it's part of expected behavior.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple PowerShell executions downloading files, registry modifications by different processes, and potential file creations in user directories suggest possible malicious activity. The repeated patterns and diverse processes involved make me lean towards classifying this batch as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions downloading files from GitHub, registry modifications, and file creations indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. I'm going to go through each event and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries involving `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The tasks associated with it include file creation, accessing processes, and modifying the registry. For example, in one event, `powershell.exe` accesses a process (rule: ProcessAccess), which could be indicative of lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nThen there are several instances where `schtasks.exe` is used. I know that schtasks can manage scheduled tasks on Windows. The command lines here show attempts to delete specific tasks, like `\/Delete \/TN spawn`. This might suggest an attacker trying to remove traces of their activities or disable monitoring tools.\n\nLooking at other processes, `cmd.exe` appears with commands that redirect output to null, which is a common tactic to suppress console output and avoid detection. The command line `\/c SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F >nul 2>&1` indicates an attempt to delete a task without showing any output in the command prompt.\n\nRegistry modifications are another red flag. Several events show registry value sets or deletions involving `svchost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and others. Registry changes can be used to persistence mechanisms, hiding malicious activities, or altering system configurations to enable backdoor access.\n\nThe combination of these activities—using PowerShell for process access and registry modifications, deleting scheduled tasks via SCHTASKS, and using cmd.exe to suppress output—all point towards potential malicious behavior. These actions are often part of a larger attack strategy, such as persistence, data exfiltration, or system compromise.\n\nWhile some events might be benign (like notepad.exe accessing the registry for legitimate purposes), the frequency and combination of these activities involving known tools for both administration and potential abuse raises concerns. The high number of events related to process creation and file modifications further supports the idea that there's something unusual happening on the system.\n\nTaking all these points into account, this batch of events does seem relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including PowerShell process access, registry modifications, and deletion of scheduled tasks which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances of processes being created and accessed. Notably, powershell.exe appears several times with different command lines. Sometimes the command line is just \"& {}\", which seems a bit generic but could be part of automation or legitimate use.\n\nThen, I see that conhost.exe and whoami.exe are also involved. These can be benign tools but might be used maliciously too. The events show registry modifications—like setting and deleting values in HKCU\\Run. This is concerning because attackers often use the Run key to persistence their malware.\n\nLooking at the process command lines, some PowerShell executions look suspicious. For example, \"powershell.exe & {}\" repeated multiple times might indicate a script being executed without clear intent. There's also an instance where cmd.exe deletes a registry value related to \"modulo_temporario\", which could be trying to remove traces of something.\n\nThe use of reg.exe to delete and modify the Registry is another red flag. Attackers often manipulate the Registry for persistence or to hide their tracks. The repeated attempts to access and modify these keys suggest potential malicious activity, possibly part of a larger script trying to ensure persistence across reboots.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where processes are accessed but no file is involved, which might indicate in-memory attacks or lateral movement within the network.\n\nConsidering all this together, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions with ambiguous command lines, registry modifications for persistence, and attempts to clean up traces (like deleting Run keys) points towards potential malicious behavior. It's not a single event that stands out but the pattern over time suggests something值得关注。\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell executions with ambiguous command lines, registry modifications for persistence, and attempts to clean up traces, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's look at the JSONL data provided.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries where powershell.exe is the process. That makes sense because PowerShell can do a lot of things, both legitimate and malicious. But in itself, just running it isn't suspicious unless there are other factors.\n\nLooking deeper, most events involve image loads or file operations. For example, powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. Those seem normal as they're part of the .NET framework. Similarly, creating temporary files like __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1 is something PowerShell might do when testing script policies, which can happen during a session.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created and then immediately deleted. That could be a sign of something malicious trying to clean up evidence, but it could also just be a legitimate process.\n\nI see some events from winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files. Winlogbeat is a known tool for log management, so that seems benign.\n\nThen there are other processes like whoami.exe and cmd.exe being called. These are common tools and can be part of normal system operations or scripts. Without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nThe registry value sets by powershell.exe and conhost.exe could indicate configuration changes. Again, without knowing the exact changes made, it's tricky to assess risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes with various activities, some file creations\/deletions, registry modifications, and other standard tools being used. While these actions can be indicative of malicious behavior, there's no clear evidence here that points to an attack. It could just be normal system activity or a user running scripts.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING because the events don't strongly indicate malicious intent on their own. However, there's a slight chance that some activities might be part of an attack, so my confidence isn't too high.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal PowerShell activity including script policy testing and file operations, which are not inherently suspicious without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}

So, I'm given a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze them all together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nLooking at the first few events: there's cmd.exe setting a registry value, then conhost.exe doing something similar. Then, whoami.exe runs, which isn't too suspicious on its own but could be part of legitimate activities or malicious ones. \n\nThe majority of the events are related to powershell.exe. It accesses processes, sets registry values, and loads various images. The command lines sometimes include \"& {}\" which is a way to run commands in PowerShell without outputting anything, which can be a red flag because attackers often try to hide their activity.\n\nI notice that there's a file created and then deleted: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1\". Creating and immediately deleting files can be a tactic to avoid detection. Also, the paths like \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local...\" suggest specific user targeting, which could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThe events involving Provider Lifecycle under powershell.exe are a bit unclear to me, but given that many events cluster around PowerShell, it's probably being used for some automated task or possibly malicious script execution.\n\nPutting all this together, the recurring use of PowerShell with hidden command lines and file operations suggests potential malicious behavior. The creation and deletion of a script file is particularly concerning because it might indicate testing permissions or executing arbitrary code without leaving traces.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious activity, including repeated PowerShell executions with hidden commands, registry modifications, and file creation\/deletion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a few Calculator.exe and chrome.exe processes creating pipes and setting registry values. That seems a bit unusual because those aren't typically used for malicious activities, but I shouldn't rule them out yet.\n\nThen, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful and can do both legitimate and malicious tasks. The events show that powershell.exe is creating pipes, accessing processes, setting registry values, loading images, and even creating files in the StartupProfileData directory. That could be suspicious, especially if those files are not standard.\n\nI notice a command line argument: \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This looks like an attempt to delete a file in the TEMP folder, which might indicate that something was downloaded there and is being cleaned up. Cleaning up after oneself is a common tactic for malware to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process running. That could be used by attackers to check user privileges or system information, which adds to the suspicion. Additionally, conhost.exe is involved in some registry changes. Conhost is often used as part of command-line tools, but again, it's worth noting if it's doing something unusual.\n\nThe repeated Registry value sets from various processes might be an attempt to modify system configurations, possibly to maintain persistence or elevate privileges. The image loads for MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll don't immediately raise red flags, but combined with the other activities, they could be part of a larger malicious process.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe is being used extensively with potentially malicious command-line arguments, file deletions, and system modifications. These behaviors are common indicators of possible compromise or malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including extensive PowerShell usage, deletion attempts, and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me start by looking at each event and seeing what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe. The winlog task mentions Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad) and the file paths point to various .NET framework files and Windows Defender components. That seems normal because PowerShell often loads these modules when running scripts.\n\nThen I see a File created event for a PowerShell script in the user's Temp directory, followed by a File Delete logged event for the same file. This looks suspicious because creating and immediately deleting a script could be part of an attempt to avoid detection. Malware sometimes does this to leave no trace of their malicious script.\n\nNext, there are several Pipe Created events from powershell.exe. Creating pipes can allow inter-process communication, which might be legitimate but could also be used for command-and-control or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nThe later events show PowerShell commands using Remove-Item to delete files in the TEMP directory with specific names ending in .zip. This seems like cleanup operations, possibly removing temporary files after some process. However, if these files were created maliciously and deleted to cover tracks, it raises a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries from chrome.exe loading normal system DLLs and interacting with the registry. These don't seem concerning on their own but are present throughout the logs, which might indicate background processes or legitimate activity.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file operations that create and then delete a script in the Temp directory, along with attempts to remove several .zip files from the same location. This pattern could be indicative of malicious behavior aiming to clean up evidence after executing some payload. The repeated use of PowerShell for deletion commands adds to the suspicion.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these actions are definitely malicious, but the combination is enough to raise concern.

That's unusual because non-interactive profiles don't typically run scripts on startup, so that might be suspicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries of Registry value sets and Process accesses related to powershell.exe. This could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen I see whoami.exe being executed. While not inherently malicious, it's often used by attackers to check user privileges, which raises a flag in this context.\n\nThere are several events where PowerShell is deleting files from the TEMP directory, specifically .txt files with names like tarefa_base.txt and estrutura_ativo.txt. These could be remnants of malicious scripts or data exfiltration attempts.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs when running powershell.exe. This might suggest that the script is loading additional components or modules, which can be a sign of malicious activity trying to hide its actions.\n\nLastly, there's a FileCreate and subsequent FileDeleteDetected event for a PowerShell script in the TEMP folder. The creation and immediate deletion of such scripts are common tactics in attacks to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with various suspicious activities—registry modifications, file deletions, potential persistence mechanisms, and attempts to load modules—all point towards possible malicious behavior.

Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are from PowerShell executing commands to remove files in the TEMP directory. The command lines show that they're deleting specific text files like 'registro_auxiliar.txt' and others. That seems a bit suspicious because why would someone delete temporary files so systematically? It might be part of some cleanup routine, but I'm not sure if it's malicious.\n\nThen there are events where PowerShell is loading different DLLs or creating files in user directories. For example, the file path 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive' being created by PowerShell could be part of legitimate operations, but it's worth noting.\n\nThere are a couple of events where 'whoami.exe' is run. That tool usually shows user information, which can be useful for scripts or malware to determine the current user context. So running it might indicate someone trying to gather system info, but it's not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nThe other thing I notice is multiple Registry value sets from Chrome and RuntimeBroker. Those are legitimate processes, so their registry activity is probably normal unless there's something unusual about the specific keys being modified, which isn't clear here.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several PowerShell commands deleting temp files and some process creations and file operations. While each individual event might not be alarming, the combination—especially multiple deletions in a short time frame and the use of whoami.exe—could indicate some level of activity worth looking into. It's possible that an attacker is cleaning up logs or gathering information. However, without more context, it's hard to say for certain.\n\nI'm leaning towards 'INTERESTING' because there are enough potentially suspicious activities together, even though each one individually might not be concerning.

Let me start by looking through each event one by one to see what's going on.\n\nThe first few entries are all about PowerShell.exe being accessed multiple times. That's interesting because while PowerShell is a common tool for admins, it's also frequently used in attacks. But then I notice some Process Create tasks for whoami.exe. Whoami is usually benign, just showing user info, so that alone isn't suspicious.\n\nLooking further down, there are events where files are being created by both PowerShell and winlogbeat.exe. The file paths seem legitimate at first glance—like the .winlogbeat.yml.new file. But then I see a file named pacote_ativo.txt created by PowerShell, which is Portuguese for \"active package.\" That's a bit odd. In some contexts, especially with malware, files with generic names might be used to drop malicious payloads.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell execution and file creation.
