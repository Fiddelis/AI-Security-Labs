{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of JSONL events to analyze. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is about powershell.exe accessing something. Not sure yet if that's bad, but PowerShell can do a lot. Then there's whoami.exe being executed normally, so probably not an issue. Another powershell.exe access follows, which I'll keep in mind.\n\nNext up is svchost.exe, which is a common system process, but here it's setting a registry value. That might be normal or could be part of malicious activity; I'm not sure yet. Then another powershell.exe accessing the registry—this seems suspicious because attackers often use legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where PowerShell is loading various .NET and Windows Defender files. While this isn't outright bad, it's worth noting that PowerShell can load a lot of modules.\n\nThe next few events have complex command lines in powershell.exe. They involve capturing the screen into bitmap files saved in the TEMP directory. This looks like screenshot functionality. If someone is taking screenshots programmatically, especially from an unfamiliar script, it could be part of data exfiltration or surveillance—definitely something to look into.\n\nTwo more events with similar command lines suggest repeated attempts or different instances doing the same thing, which might indicate automated behavior or multiple steps in a process.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple PowerShell instances, registry modifications, and screenshot captures. These activities could be part of a malicious script trying to gather information. The combination of registry changes and screen captures is concerning because it points towards potential persistence mechanisms and data collection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines performing registry modifications and attempting to capture the screen, which could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. That's already a red flag because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines in these events all seem to be capturing screenshots using System.Windows.Forms. They're saving images to temporary files like elemento_ativo.png or modulo_principal.png. This behavior could indicate some kind of screen scraping or data collection, which might be part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and process details, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is executing these commands. The fact that they're saving images to different temp directories suggests it's not just a one-off event but part of a script or automated process. This repetition could mean it's a script running multiple times or capturing different parts of the screen.\n\nThen there are events where files are being created and deleted, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1 in the Temp folder. The creation and subsequent deletion of this file might be an attempt to avoid detection by cleaning up after itself. It's a common tactic in malware to delete traces of their activities.\n\nAnother event shows a pipe being created, which could allow for communication between different processes or even remote commands. This is concerning because pipes can be used to facilitate command execution and data transfer, which is often part of how malware communicates with its command-and-control servers.\n\nThere are also events where remote commands are executed. These kinds of activities are highly suspicious because they can indicate unauthorized access or the execution of malicious code. The fact that there are multiple execute a remote command tasks makes me think this could be part of a larger attack vector.\n\nAdditionally, an image load event for MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory is logged. While this might seem normal, sometimes attackers will inject malicious code into legitimate processes or load harmful libraries. However, in this case, it's more likely related to antivirus operations unless there's evidence of tampering.\n\nPutting all these together, the repeated use of PowerShell for screen capturing, file manipulation, and remote command execution points towards potentially malicious behavior. The combination of multiple suspicious activities over a short period increases the concern that this batch of events isn't just random or benign.\n\nI also think about how attackers might structure their campaigns. They often test scripts, create temporary files, use known tools like PowerShell for obfuscation, and clean up after themselves to avoid detection. This batch shows several of these hallmarks, making it more likely than not that there's something malicious going on.\n\nSo, considering all the events as a whole, there are multiple red flags indicating possible malicious activity. The repetitive use of PowerShell with suspicious commands, file operations, remote execution, and attempts to create communication channels all contribute to a high confidence level that this batch is indeed interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity including screen capturing, file creation\/deletion, pipe creation, and remote command execution indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL logs here. Each line represents an event with some process information, Windows log tasks, and file details.\n\nFirst, I see that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. One of them has a command line that's pretty long and seems like it's doing something related to capturing the screen. The command uses Add-Type to load the System.Windows.Forms assembly, which allows interacting with the graphical user interface. Then it captures the virtual screen into a bitmap and saves it as elemento_base.png in the TEMP directory. That part stands out because taking screenshots can be part of malicious activities like screen scraping or screenshotting without user consent.\n\nLooking further, there are several tasks related to file creation, registry value sets, and process access. For example, powershell.exe creates a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder under the user's AppData directory. That seems suspicious because non-interactive profiles usually aren't used when a user is logged in, so why would PowerShell be creating files there? It could be trying to hide its activity or persistence.\n\nThere are also entries from conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe performing registry operations. Conhost is typically related to console windows, but if it's modifying the registry, that might indicate some form of persistence or configuration change. Winlogbeat might be a legitimate tool for log management, but paired with other events, it could raise flags.\n\nThe bulk of the events are from chrome.exe. It's performing several registry writes and DNS queries. While Chrome is a common browser, multiple registry writes in quick succession might not be normal. Also, there's an image load event for MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which is legitimate, but combined with other activities, it could indicate some process injection or malicious code trying to hide itself using known system files.\n\nPutting this all together, the presence of powershell.exe executing commands that interact with the graphical interface and accessing sensitive areas like the virtual screen, along with multiple registry modifications across different processes, suggests potential malicious activity. The combination of these events isn't something you'd typically see in normal user activities or legitimate software operations. It looks like someone is trying to gain persistence on the system, capture information, or hide their tracks.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I would classify this batch as INTERESTING because it shows signs of potential malicious behavior across multiple processes and actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activities including PowerShell screen capture attempts, file creation in non-interactive profiles, and numerous registry modifications by Chrome. These could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
