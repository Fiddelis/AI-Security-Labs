{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are five events from chrome.exe showing network connections and a DNS query. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of networking for browsing. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen I notice several events involving powershell.exe. The first one shows that PowerShell was executed with a specific command line. Let me parse that command: it looks like it's running some system commands, including net user, get-localuser, and others. These commands can be used to retrieve information about users and groups, which isn't inherently bad, but when combined with other actions, could indicate malicious activity.\n\nNext, there are events where PowerShell accesses processes, sets registry values, and loads various images. The file paths mentioned in the ImageLoad tasks seem legitimate—parts of .NET frameworks and system libraries. So maybe that's just normal operation for scripts or PowerShell itself.\n\nHowever, I also see a FileCreate event followed by a FileDeleteDetected. That's interesting because creating and then deleting a file quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection. The filename __PSScriptPolicyTest seems like it might be related to script policy testing, but the fact that it's created and then deleted could be a red flag for malicious activity trying to test permissions or persistence.\n\nAdditionally, there are Provider Lifecycle events from PowerShell with the same command line as before. This repetition suggests that PowerShell is being used in a loop or as part of some automated process, which might be part of a larger script or attack sequence.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual actions like network connections and image loading aren't suspicious, the combination—especially the file creation\/deletion and the repeated use of PowerShell with potentially compromising commands—raises concerns. This could indicate someone trying to gather system information, possibly for lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events including process creation, registry modifications, and file operations suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where `powershell.exe` is being executed with a command line that includes several network and directory listings. These commands like `net user`, `get-localuser`, and others are often used in scripts to gather system information or elevate privileges. The fact that this script runs multiple times could indicate something suspicious, especially if it's trying different tasks each time.\n\nNext, there are events where `winlogbeat.exe` is creating files, specifically `.winlogbeat.yml.new`. I know winlogbeat is a log shipping tool, so while file creation is normal, the fact that it's appearing here might be part of legitimate operations. But if it's paired with other unusual activities, it could warrant closer look.\n\nThen there are several instances where `chrome.exe` is modifying registry values repeatedly. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings, multiple such events in a row without any clear pattern might suggest tampering or attempts to hide traces.\n\nLooking at other processes like `net.exe`, `net1.exe`, and others accessing system files and directories could indicate potential privilege escalation or lateral movement techniques. The repeated use of these commands might be part of an attack chain trying to gather user information or disable security features.\n\nAdditionally, the loading of various DLLs by `powershell.exe` and other executables could be indicative of malicious code injection or attempts to load unauthorized libraries into legitimate processes.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions with potentially malicious commands, unusual file creations, repeated registry modifications, and process accesses suggests a coordinated effort that might be part of an attack. The confidence level isn't extremely high because some events could still be benign, but the pattern is concerning enough to merit investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with potential malicious commands and unusual file creations indicate possible suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and decide if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is an updater.exe running with some command-line arguments. It looks like it's from GoogleUpdater checking for updates, which seems normal. Next, cmdkey.exe is used with \/list, which typically lists cached credentials. That might be a bit concerning on its own, but I need to see more context.\n\nThen there are multiple events related to PowerShell and various commands. The command line includes net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, and cmdkey again. This seems like someone is querying user accounts and groups, which could indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement. Also, using 'powershell.exe & { ... }' suggests executing a script inline, which is common for malicious activities.\n\nThere are several events with tasks labeled as Security Group Management. These might be legitimate admin actions, but the frequency here seems high, so I should keep an eye on that. The next event about Image loaded for combase.dll by SDXHelper.exe could be normal, but sometimes such DLLs are used in attacks.\n\nThen there's net.exe and net1.exe being used to query local groups. These commands are often part of reconnaissance activities. Also, PowerShell creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory might be setting up persistence mechanisms, which is a red flag.\n\nThe Registry value set events by powershell.exe and conhost.exe could indicate changes to system configurations or creating persistent keys for malicious software. \n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of user enumeration, potential credential access, and possible creation of persistence points using PowerShell. These activities are common in attacks, so the batch as a whole is definitely interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of potentially malicious activity including command-line tools for user enumeration, credential access, and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. So, I've got a batch of system log events to analyze, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst off, looking at each event individually:\n\n1. **winlogbeat.exe** creating a file: WinLogBeat is an agent used by Elasticsearch for Windows logs. It's normal for it to create files as part of its operation, so nothing suspicious here.\n   \n2. **SDXHelper.exe** loading urlmon.dll: URLMON.DLL is a standard Windows DLL related to URL handling. SDXHelper might be legitimate software or possibly malicious, but the specific action here doesn't raise red flags.\n\n3. **powershell.exe** creating a file named modulo_base.txt: PowerShell is a common tool for both admin tasks and attacks. Creating a file could be part of script execution, which can be either benign or malicious depending on context. I'll need to keep this in mind.\n\n4. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe** installing from the command line: Edge updates are managed by Microsoft, so it's normal for them to execute with parameters like \/ua and \/installsource. This doesn't seem suspicious.\n\n5. **svchost.exe** modifying registry values twice:_svhost.exe is a common process that hosts various services in Windows. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate operations or malicious activities. Without more context, it's hard to say here.\n\n6. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe** loading taskschd.dll: Again, Edge Update using standard system files as part of its operation; nothing unusual.\n\n7. **backgroundTaskHost.exe** loading urlmon.dll: Background Task Host is a Windows service managing background applications. Using URLMON.DLL isn't suspicious on its own.\n\n8. Another instance of **winlogbeat.exe** creating the same file again: As before, this seems normal for log rotation or updates.\n\n9. **powershell.exe** accessing registry values and another process access event: PowerShell interacting with the registry is common but could be part of malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation. This might warrant closer look.\n\nNow, considering the batch as a whole:\n\n- The events span various processes, including legitimate system updates (EdgeUpdate), log agents (WinLogBeat), and common tools like PowerShell.\n- Notably, there are two instances where powershell.exe creates files and interacts with registry values. While not inherently malicious, repeated actions by PowerShell could indicate script execution or persistence mechanisms.\n- The multiple registry writes by svchost.exe might be worth investigating since it's a known process used in some malware for hiding.\n\nPutting this together, the presence of potentially legitimate but also possibly malicious activities across different processes makes the batch interesting. However, without clear indicators of compromise (like known malicious file hashes or specific process behaviors), the confidence level isn't extremely high.\n\nOn balance, there are enough red flags to suggest that further investigation might be warranted, but it's not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes events from multiple processes, including PowerShell creating files and accessing registry values, which may indicate potential malicious activity. The repeated actions by svchost.exe modifying the registry could also be concerning.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
