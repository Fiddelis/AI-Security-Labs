{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several instances of processes like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, etc., being created or accessing registry values. Some of these activities seem normalâ€”like using Chrome or running systeminfo.exe to check system info.\n\nI notice that cmd.exe is used with commands like systeminfo and reg query, which could be legitimate for system admin tasks. Powershell.exe also appears a few times, both creating processes and being accessed. Since PowerShell can be used maliciously but is commonly used for good purposes too, it's not immediately suspicious unless combined with other actions.\n\nThere are events where svchost.exe creates files in winevt\/Logs directories. SvcHost is known to run legitimate services, so this might just be normal logging activities.\n\nThe WmiPrvSE.exe process stands out a bit because it's related to WMI, which can be used for malicious purposes like creating backdoors. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious or part of regular system operations.\n\nI see multiple registry accesses and modifications across different processes. While some are normal, excessive registry changes could indicate tampering, but in this batch, they don't seem unusual enough on their own.\n\nNotably, there's a process using reg.exe to query the Disk\\Enum key under HKLM, which is related to disk drives. This might be part of legitimate hardware detection, but it could also be something more nefarious like checking for attached devices.\n\nLooking at all events together, none seem to indicate clear signs of malicious activity. They mostly involve standard processes and system queries that aren't out of the ordinary. However, some actions like using WmiPrvSE.exe and multiple registry accesses might warrant closer monitoring in a real-world scenario.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple process creations and system-related activities, including cmd.exe executing commands, powershell.exe being accessed, and svchost.exe modifying logs. These actions could indicate potential malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first line, winlogbeat.exe created a file. That seems normal because it's part of the log management tool. Then there are multiple events from ApplicationFrameHost.exe and powershell.exe accessing registry values. Registry access can be common but also sometimes used in malicious activities. The fact that powershell is involved might raise an eyebrow since it's often used by attackers.\n\nNext, I see several entries where chrome.exe is setting registry values. That could be part of normal operation, especially if Chrome is tweaking settings. But multiple such events might indicate something more suspicious, like persistence mechanisms. Also, Chrome loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll sounds legitimate because those are Windows Defender files.\n\nThere's another winlogbeat file creation event and a powershell creating an object named 'objeto_padrao.txt'. The filename doesn't seem malicious on its own, but combined with other actions by powershell, it could be part of file operations for malicious purposes.\n\nOverall, while there are some red flags like multiple registry writes by chrome.exe and powershell, these might just be normal activities. However, the repetition of certain events and the use of powershell make me think this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by Chrome.exe and PowerShell.exe, along with file creation activities, may indicate potential malicious behavior or system configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. Let me start by looking at each event and see if there's anything that stands out.\n\nThe first event has a process named \"chrome.exe\". That sounds normal because Chrome is a common browser people use every day. So, seeing chrome.exe in the logs isn't unusual on its own.\n\nNext, the Windows log entry mentions a task: 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'. Hmm, so something modified the registry. But since it's coming from chrome.exe, which often needs to make changes to the system for settings, extensions, or updates, this could be legitimate. I don't immediately see a red flag here.\n\nThe file field is \"None\", which probably means there wasn't any file operation associated with this event. That makes sense because registry operations typically don't involve files directly unless it's part of a larger process like an update, but that's still within the realm of normal activity for Chrome.\n\nPutting it all together: A common application (Chrome) making a standard modification to the registry doesn't raise any alarms. There's no indication of unauthorized access or malicious behavior here. So, I'd classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because each event on its own and in combination isn't pointing towards anything suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal activity with Chrome.exe modifying the registry, which is typical for legitimate operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
