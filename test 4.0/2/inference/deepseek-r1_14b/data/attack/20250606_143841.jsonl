I'm seeing multiple events involving powershell.exe, which is often used in both legitimate and malicious activities. \n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are several instances where powershell.exe is being accessed or created. This could be normal admin activity, but it's worth noting that powershell has administrative privileges, so repeated access might indicate something suspicious.\n\nThen, I notice a cmd.exe process with an empty command line. That seems odd because usually, when cmd runs a command, the command_line field would have some details. An empty string here makes me wonder if it's trying to hide its actions or maybe part of a larger script execution.\n\nThere are multiple registry accesses and image loads by powershell.exe. The files being accessed are system-related, which isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other events, it could be concerning. Also, there's a file creation and deletion of a PowerShell script in the temp directory. Creating and then deleting a script might be an attempt to erase evidence of malicious activity.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events for the same script file. This pattern suggests that something might be trying to write a malicious script temporarily, execute it, and then remove it to avoid detection.\n\nThe use of pipes in powershell.exe could indicate communication between different processes or scripts, which is common in command-line attacks to hide activity or coordinate actions across multiple tools.\n\nTaking all these events together—multiple powershell executions with varying activities, hidden command lines, file manipulation—it seems like a possible attack vector.

The user wants a single classification for the entire batch.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple events related to powershell.exe being executed.

The command line shows \"& {}\" which is unusual and might indicate code injection or obfuscation.\n\nThere are several registry modifications (Registry value set), file creations, deletions, and numerous image load events from different DLLs. These activities could be part of a script trying to test policies or create temporary files, but the combination seems suspicious.\n\nThe batch includes creating and immediately deleting a .ps1 file, which might suggest an attempt to bypass script policy checks by using a self-deleting script.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving 'whoami.exe' and 'powershell.exe'. These are common tools but can be red flags depending on usage. The whoami command is typically used to check user information, which might not be malicious on its own, but when combined with other actions could indicate something suspicious.\n\nNext, I notice several instances where powershell.exe is being accessed or creating processes. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The fact that it's accessing various files and registry entries is concerning because it suggests the process might be trying to elevate privileges or gather information about the system.\n\nLooking at the events, I see a file creation event for a .ps1 script in the Temp directory: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_h1gpo202.5ec.ps1'. This temporary PowerShell script could be part of testing permissions or executing arbitrary code, which is a common tactic in attacks. The fact that it's created and then deleted shortly after might be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell scripts, but the specific files being loaded don't raise any immediate red flags unless they're known malicious ones. However, the combination of creating, deleting, and accessing different system components could indicate a broader malicious activity.\n\nThe process names like 'svchost.exe' are also worth noting because it's a legitimate Windows process, but sometimes malware can replace or modify genuine services to hide their activities. The file created by svchost.exe is in a network service profile directory, which might be normal, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nOverall, the pattern here seems to involve extensive use of PowerShell with various system interactions and temporary file creations. While individual events could be benign, together they suggest potential malicious behavior, such as privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell instances accessing system components and creating\/deleting a temporary script, indicative of potentially malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few events are all from powershell.exe. It seems like it's loading a DLL file related to Windows Defender, which is unusual because Defender should already be running. Then there's a file creation in the PowerShell StartupProfileData folder—maybe that's normal if someone is setting up an environment for script execution. But then I notice several Registry value sets and process accesses by powershell.exe. That could indicate some scripting activity, possibly legitimate or malicious.\n\nNext, I see two instances of whoami.exe being executed with standard paths. That's a common command to check user information, but it's worth noting if it's part of an automated process or something else. Then there's cmd.exe running a netsh command to turn off Windows Defender Firewall. Turning off the firewall is a big red flag because it removes a layer of protection. If this happened without proper authorization, that's concerning.\n\nFollowing that, there's a direct execution of netsh.exe to disable the same firewall setting. This reinforces the concern since using netsh directly can bypass some safeguards, and doing it twice might indicate testing or persistence.\n\nThen there are multiple events from svchost.exe interacting with the Registry in various ways—adding, deleting, or modifying entries. SvcHost is a common process for Windows services, but unusual registry activity could mean something's wrong, like installing a service or making configuration changes that shouldn't be happening.\n\nPutting it all together: we have multiple commands (powershell, cmd, netsh) being used to modify system settings—disabling the firewall and potentially making other changes via svchost. These actions could be part of legitimate administrative tasks, but considering they're spread out across different processes and some involve disabling security features, there's a high chance this activity is malicious.\n\nI'm also thinking about persistence mechanisms. Turning off the firewall might be an attempt to ensure that any subsequent malicious activities aren't blocked. The powershell.exe events could be part of a script that's being run at startup or through another method, which would make it persistent across reboots.\n\nAnother point is the use of command-line arguments in cmd.exe and netsh.exe. The exact commands used (netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off) are known to disable the firewall, and seeing them executed twice might indicate a script trying different ways or ensuring the change was successful.\n\nThe svchost.exe events with registry modifications could be related to creating new services or altering existing ones, which is another common tactic for malware to maintain persistence. Since these events are numerous and involve multiple writes\/changes, it's suspicious.\n\nI also wonder about the timestamps of these events—are they happening in quick succession? If so, that might suggest a coordinated attack where different parts are executed one after another. Alternatively, if they're spread out over time, maybe it's an ongoing process.\n\nIn summary, while some actions could be legitimate (like admin tasks), the combination of disabling the firewall and multiple registry changes by svchost.exe is concerning. The use of multiple commands to achieve similar results (disabling firewall via both cmd and netsh) adds to the suspicion. Therefore, this batch should definitely be looked into as it has all the hallmarks of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple potentially malicious activities detected including disabling of Windows Defender Firewall and suspicious registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are 25 entries in the JSONL format. Each event has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The 'process' field consistently shows 'svchost.exe', which is a common Windows process name often associated with services. By itself, svchost.exe isn't malicious, but it's frequently used by malware to hide their activities.\n\nThe 'winlog' field in each event indicates that there was an action related to the Registry—specifically, \"Registry object added or deleted\". This is under the rule named 'RegistryEvent'. Malicious actors often manipulate the Windows Registry to persistence their malware, change system configurations, or gain elevated privileges. Such changes are common in attack chains.\n\nLooking at all 25 events together, they're all identical except for possibly different timestamps (though those aren't shown here). This repetition is concerning because multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe could be part of a larger, coordinated activity. It's unusual to see so many such events unless something significant is happening, like a script or process being triggered repeatedly.\n\nI also note that the 'file' field is always null in these entries, which means there's no file operation associated with these registry changes. This makes me think that the focus here is purely on registry modifications, which could be a red flag for persistence mechanisms used by attackers.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\". The combination of multiple RegistryEvent tasks from svchost.exe over such a high number of events suggests potential malicious activity. While single instances might not raise alarms, the volume and repetition are concerning. However, there's no direct evidence here beyond the logs themselves, so my confidence is moderately high but not certain.\n\nI should also consider if these events could be legitimate. Sometimes, system updates or software installations can cause multiple registry changes. But given that all events are from svchost.exe and involve adding\/removing registry objects repeatedly, it's more likely to be suspicious. Additionally, the number of events is quite high, which might not happen in normal operations.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no smoking gun here, the pattern and volume make this batch worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple Registry modifications by svchost.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial events. There are several entries where the process is 'svchost.exe' and the winlog task is about Registry object changes or values being set. I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used by various services, but it can also be abused by malware because multiple services share this host.\n\nThe first 14 events are all from svchost.exe with tasks related to registry events—either objects added\/deleted or values set. This could be normal activity if a service is updating its configuration, but repeated such actions might indicate something suspicious. However, on their own, these might not raise too many flags unless they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen there's an event where the process has a command line argument pointing to powershell.exe with some specific commands: New-PSDrive creating a drive mapped to \\\\Target\\\\C$. This is interesting because using PowerShell for administrative tasks is common, but certain commands can be malicious. The New-PSDrive cmdlet is often used for mapping network drives or accessing remote systems.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple events where the command line is the same powershell.exe command. It's repeated several times, which makes me think that this might be part of a script or automated process running multiple times. Each instance has tasks labeled as 'Provider Lifecycle' and one as 'Engine Lifecycle'. Powershell events can sometimes indicate malicious activity, especially when they're executed with specific commands that allow remote access or system manipulation.\n\nPutting it all together: The initial registry activities by svchost.exe could be setting up something, maybe creating keys or values that enable other processes. Then the powershell.exe events using New-PSDrive to connect to a remote C$ directory (which is typically an administrative share) might indicate an attempt to access another system over the network.\n\nConsidering the combination of these events, it seems like there's a sequence where svchost.exe makes registry changes, possibly enabling certain services or configurations, followed by multiple attempts using PowerShell to connect to a remote system. This could be indicative of a potential attack where an attacker is trying to establish access to another machine on the network.\n\nThe frequency of these events—especially the repeated powershell.exe commands—is concerning. It might be part of a script that's attempting to brute-force or exploit systems, or it could be lateral movement within a network once initial access is gained. Given that there are multiple entries for both svchost.exe and powershell.exe, the pattern suggests coordinated activity rather than isolated incidents.\n\nI'm also thinking about how svchost.exe can host various services, including potentially malicious ones. If this process is being used to create or modify registry keys, it could be part of a persistence mechanism or enabling other functionalities. The PowerShell command seems like it's trying to establish a drive mapping, which might allow for further commands to be executed on the target system.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because the combination of svchost.exe registry changes and multiple powershell.exe attempts to connect to a remote C$ drive suggests possible malicious activity. The repetition and sequence imply a coordinated attack rather than normal user or service behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying the registry followed by repeated PowerShell attempts to access a remote system indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. First off, all these events are related to PowerShell being executed. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for its built-in tools and the ability to execute commands.\n\nLooking closer, the first event has a command line that uses New-PSDrive with \\Target\\C$, which seems like an attempt to access another system. This could be part of lateral movement in a network. The subsequent events show repeated calls to PowerShell without any arguments, which might indicate some kind of script or automated process running.\n\nThen there's this specific command: checking if procdump.exe exists and exiting based on that. Procdump is a legitimate tool for debugging but can also be used maliciously. If an attacker is trying to check if procdump is present, they might plan to drop it later or use it to capture processes.\n\nThe repetition of these commands across multiple events suggests scripting or automation. Attackers often use scripts to carry out tasks like persistence, data exfiltration, or lateral movement. The fact that the same command appears multiple times could mean an ongoing process trying different things or attempting to bypass detection.\n\nAlso, considering that some events are from 'Engine Lifecycle' and others from 'Provider Lifecycle', it might indicate different stages of a script execution. Maybe the initial commands are setting up drives or checking paths, while subsequent ones are actually deploying payloads.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated PowerShell executions with varied but suspicious command lines, attempts to access other systems, checking for specific files—this batch shows behavior that could be indicative of malicious activity. The confidence is high because each individual event might not be too concerning, but the combination and repetition make it suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated PowerShell command executions with potential attempts to access external drives (e.g., \\\\Target\\\\C$) and check for file existence.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at the events provided. There are two identical JSON objects in this batch. Each event is from the Windows operating system and involves PowerShell executing a command.\n\nThe command line for each process shows that PowerShell is running a script that checks if \"procdump.exe\" exists in a specific directory. If it does, the script exits with code 0; otherwise, it exits with code 1. This kind of check can be common in scripts to ensure certain tools are present before proceeding.\n\nI don't see any direct indicators of malicious activity here. The use of PowerShell is standard for scripting and system administration tasks. The file path seems legitimate, pointing to a known location where procdump.exe might be stored. There's no evidence of unusual access patterns, network connections, or file modifications that would raise red flags.\n\nHowever, it's possible that this script could be part of a larger malicious process. For instance, if the procdump.exe is actually malicious, but based solely on these events, there's no indication of that. The events don't show any execution of procdump.exe or other suspicious activities beyond checking its presence.\n\nSo, while not entirely normal in some contexts, without more information, this doesn't strongly indicate malicious behavior. Therefore, I'd classify the batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show PowerShell checking for the existence of procdump.exe but do not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
