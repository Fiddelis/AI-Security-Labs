{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing some system activity on Windows.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first few logs are about Microsoft Edge update processes: creating files and changing their creation times. That seems normal because software updates often create temporary files during installation.\n\nNext, there are entries from CompatTelRunner.exe loading some DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate system components, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen, I see setup.exe creating a pipe. Pipes in Windows can be part of normal process communication, especially during installations or updates, so that's not alarming on its own.\n\nLooking further down, services.exe and taskhostw.exe are involved in logon events. These processes are standard for system services and scheduling tasks, respectively, so their activities are expected.\n\nThere are several entries with null processes and tasks like Special Logon and User Account Management. These could be related to user login or account changes but don't provide enough context to raise a flag unless they're part of an unusual pattern.\n\nI notice two powershell.exe instances: one with an execution policy set to Restricted, which is a common security measure to prevent script execution. The command being run checks for specific INF files and exits if it finds them. This seems like a legitimate system check or possibly a script that's part of normal operations.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event creates a file in the StartupProfileData directory, which is standard behavior for PowerShell when starting non-interactive sessions. No signs of malicious activity here.\n\nFinally, chrome.exe makes a DNS query, which is normal browser behavior as it resolves domain names.\n\nPutting all these together, each individual event looks benign. There's no indication of unusual access patterns, multiple failed attempts, or known malicious file hashes. The combination doesn't suggest an attack vector; instead, it seems like regular system updates and process activities.\n\nHowever, the volume of User Account Management events (repeated 14 times) might be worth a closer look. High frequency could indicate privilege escalation or account manipulation, but without additional context, it's hard to say if this is malicious. Still, considering all other events are normal, the overall risk seems low.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear sign of malicious behavior. Each event can be explained by standard system operations and updates.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activities, including processes related to Microsoft Edge update, legitimate DLL loadings, PowerShell executions under restricted policies, and standard user account management tasks.

Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst up is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal because winlogbeat is likely logging data as part of its monitoring function. Next, svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process, so that's not unusual. It happens frequently for various services.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. The Calculator app is standard, and urlmon is a Windows DLL for URL handling, which makes sense here. Moving on, another svchost.exe instance with specific command line arguments. That looks like it's running as part of a service, so that's expected.\n\nChrome.exe also sets a registry value. Browsers often interact with the registry to store settings or preferences, so this is typical activity. MsMpEng.exe loading taskschd.dll—Windows Defender processes are known to do this for scheduled tasks.\n\nAnother winlogbeat file creation; again, consistent with logging behavior. ComptelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll as well, which aligns with its role in managing Windows features like remote desktop or error reporting.\n\nNow, several svchost.exe events creating files related to Delivery Optimization under NetworkService profile. This might be part of Windows Update's delivery optimization feature, which caches updates for other machines. It's legitimate but something to watch because sometimes attackers can abuse this service.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe both creating and deleting a file in the Temp directory. Edge's update process does this when downloading and installing updates, so it's normal unless there's something unusual about the files involved.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe loading Defender-related DLLs and creating a lock file in Temp. This is part of Windows Defender operations, possibly during scans or updates. The creation of temp files here isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nConhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values. Conhost is used by command-line tools to host Windows console applications, and mintty is for Cygwin\/Mingw environments. If these are running as expected with legitimate processes, their activity shouldn't raise flags.\n\nPutting it all together, most of the events are standard system processes performing normal operations—file creations, registry modifications, loading DLLs, etc. While there's some interesting points like svchost.exe creating files under NetworkService, which could be monitored more closely, there's no clear indication of malicious activity across the batch. The overall pattern doesn't suggest an attack or unauthorized access.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit cautious because sometimes legitimate processes can be part of a larger campaign.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first two entries are both related to \"MpCmdRun.exe\" loading image files for Windows Defender components: MpClient.dll and MpCommu.dll. This seems normal because Windows Defender is an essential security component, and these processes are part of its operation. Image load events are common and usually not indicative of malicious activity unless there's something unusual about the file paths or versions.\n\nThe third event has null values for process, winlog, and file, which doesn't provide any meaningful information and can be safely ignored.\n\nNext, a series of events (from 4 to 17) involve \"git.exe\" creating various files within the node_modules directory. Specifically, these are files related to the 'semver' package, which is used for versioning in software projects. Since this activity is happening during a git operation and involves standard npm modules, it appears to be part of a legitimate development or build process.\n\nPutting all events together, I don't see any red flags. The events either relate to normal Windows Defender operations or are part of a user's development workflow with Git and Node.js. There’s no evidence of unexpected file accesses, failed logins, or processes that shouldn’t be running.

These events likely occurred during the installation or update of the semver package. The fact that multiple files are being created suggests it's part of the standard setup process.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here, like unusual file names, writes to system directories, or attempts to execute scripts outside the expected scope.

Semver is a well-known Node.js module used for semantic versioning, which makes sense if this is part of a software development project.\n\nSince each event is just a file creation notification from Git, it's likely that someone is working on a project where node_modules are being set up or updated. This is a common activity when developers clone repositories, install dependencies, or sync changes. The fact that multiple files are being created in sequence suggests an automated process, possibly during a build or install step.\n\nI don't see any indicators of malicious behavior here. No signs of unusual file paths, access to restricted areas, or activities outside the scope of typical development work. All the file paths are expected within a node_modules structure, and git.exe is a standard tool used in software development environments.\n\nConsidering that these events are part of normal operations for someone using Git and Node.js, there's no reason to flag this batch as interesting from a security perspective.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at a batch of system log events. Each event is in JSONL format, which means one JSON object per line. The task is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nLet me start by examining each individual event. They all share similar structures: process information indicating that \"git.exe\" is running, a Windows log entry noting a file creation event, and details about the file path where the file was created.\n\nI notice that every line shows that git.exe is creating a file. The paths are within the \"node_modules\" directory of a user's folder named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". This seems to be part of a Node.js project setup, given the presence of packages like \"serialize-javascript\", \"set-blocking\", and \"set-function-length\".\n\nSo, what's happening here? It looks like someone is cloning or setting up a repository using Git. The creation of multiple files in the node_modules folder suggests that npm (Node Package Manager) is installing dependencies. This is a common step during development when you run `npm install`, which downloads and installs packages and their associated files.\n\nIs this behavior unusual? Not at all. Developers regularly work with version control systems like Git and package managers like npm, so these events are expected in a typical development environment. There's nothing indicating any malicious activity here—no signs of unauthorized access, strange file paths, or known malware indicators.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of log injection or spoofing, but since all events follow a consistent pattern and involve legitimate actions within a user's directory, there's no evidence to suggest tampering.\n\nGiven that, I don't see any red flags. These logs align with normal development activities. Therefore, the batch doesn't seem relevant for further investigation from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation during a git operation in a Node.js project setup, indicating normal development activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. Let me break down what each part means.\n\nFirst, the process name is \"git.exe\". That's the Git command-line tool. So whatever action is happening, it's being triggered by a Git process. Then there's a winlog entry indicating that a file was created, according to the FileCreate rule. The files being created are various .js, .d.ts, .json, .LICENSE, and README.md files.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to locations within \"node_modules\", like set-function-length and shebang-command. These are typical directories for npm packages in a Node.js project. The specific files include everything from source code (index.js) to configuration (package.json), documentation (README.md), and licenses.\n\nNow, considering the context: someone is using Git to create files inside their node_modules directory. But why would that be suspicious? Well, if these events are part of a legitimate software development workflow, like installing or updating packages, then it's normal. However, since all these files are being created in quick succession by git.exe, maybe there's something off.\n\nI should think about how Git is used. Normally, when you clone a repository, Git checks out the files, so perhaps this is part of a checkout process. But if someone is manually creating these files using Git commands, that could be unusual. Alternatively, it might indicate automated script execution or some form of file injection.\n\nAnother angle: node_modules directories often contain third-party libraries. If an attacker gains access, they might drop malicious modules here. However, in this case, the events are about creating multiple files within existing package directories, which seems more like a setup phase rather than malicious activity.\n\nI'm also considering if these could be part of a build process or cache clearing. Sometimes, tools recreate certain files during builds or updates. But without additional context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nThe fact that all events are from the same user (fiddelis) and path structure doesn't immediately raise red flags. However, the volume of created files in a short time might be worth looking into if this isn't part of an expected workflow.\n\nSo, is this batch interesting? It's borderline because it could be normal development activity or something more nefarious like a script dropping multiple files quickly. Without more data points, it's hard to classify as definitely malicious, but the volume and specific file operations might warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file creation activities by Git during a typical software development workflow involving Node.js packages.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

This seems like a typical setup for a Node.js project where node_modules contains third-party libraries.\n\nThe files created include package.json, index.js, test files, and others that are standard in a Node project. The presence of directories like \"test\" and files like \".eslintrc\" also aligns with common development practices.\n\nSince all these events are related to the creation of files during a Git operation (probably cloning or initializing a repository), there's nothing unusual here. It doesn't show signs of malicious activity like access to sensitive files, unexpected processes, or multiple failed attempts that might indicate brute force attacks.\n\nI don't see any red flags such as writes to unexpected locations, execution of scripts, or other anomalies that would warrant an investigation.

My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. \n\nLooking at each event, they all have \"git.exe\" as the process name and the task is about file creation. The files being created are in different paths under \"node_modules\". For example, one is creating \"signal-exit\", another \"slice-ansi\", and so on. These look like Node.js packages or modules.\n\nSo, why would these events be interesting? Well, if someone is setting up a development environment, they might clone a repository that includes node_modules. Git can sometimes be used in scripting for deployments or setups, which could involve creating files in such directories. However, if this activity is happening without legitimate reason, like during software installation or normal dev work, it's probably not suspicious.\n\nOn the other hand, an attacker might use git.exe to execute malicious scripts, especially since some npm packages can be malicious. But here, all events are about creating standard files and folders typical in a Node.js project. There's no evidence of any unusual file names or paths that stand out as suspicious. Everything seems like it's part of a normal setup process.\n\nI should also consider the volume of these events.

The files being created include various JavaScript modules like algs.js and certificate.js. These look like standard library files for a package called sshpk.\n\nI'm trying to think if these activities are normal or not. Git creating files in node_modules is typical during installations or updates of dependencies. It's part of how Node.js packages are managed. There's no indication of anything malicious here, like unexpected file paths or unusual process names.\n\nThe user's environment seems to be a development machine since they're dealing with software quality courses and Node modules.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL data provided, each line represents an event with three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file path information. The process name in every event is \"git.exe\", which tells me that whatever activity is happening here is related to Git, a version control system used for software development.\n\nThe task under winlog is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means each of these events indicates the creation of a file. That's pretty standard because when you install or update packages in Node.js using npm, Git might be involved in cloning repositories or managing submodules. So, creating files during this process is normal.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\sshpk\\\" followed by various subdirectories and filenames. The directory structure seems typical for a Node.js module called 'sshpk', which is used for SSH key management. The files include JavaScript modules, man pages (like \"man1\" directory), and other support files.\n\nSince all the events are generated by the same process (\"git.exe\") creating multiple files within a node_modules directory, it suggests that this activity is part of installing or updating a package in a Node.js project. This is a common occurrence during development work, especially when someone is setting up their environment or adding new functionality to their codebase.\n\nI'm also considering whether there's any indication of malicious behavior here. Typically, suspicious activities might include repeated failed access attempts, creation of hidden files, or changes outside expected directories. However, in this case, all the file creations are within a well-known module location for Node.js packages, and the files themselves are standard parts of the 'sshpk' library.\n\nIt's possible that these events could be part of a larger investigation if they were isolated or showed unusual patterns, but as a standalone batch, they don't raise any red flags. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, deletion of files, or other signs of compromise.

Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The common elements here are the process name \"git.exe\", the task being \"File created\" under winlog, and various file paths.\n\nFirst, git.exe is typically used for version control with Git repositories. When someone clones a repository or installs node modules, git might create files in the node_modules directory. Looking at the file paths, they're all within \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\", which suggests this is part of a Node.js project setup.\n\nEach event shows different files being created: package.json, index.js, readme.md, etc. These are standard files you'd expect when setting up or cloning a repository with node modules.

Let me go through each step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that every line is a separate JSON object.

That makes sense because Git is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments. So, this could be part of normal software development activities.\n\nLooking at the winlog task description, it's consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This indicates that a file was created, which is standard when working with files in any application. It doesn't seem suspicious on its own since creating files is something Git does regularly during operations like cloning repositories or updating dependencies.\n\nNow, examining the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\...\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\\" followed by different package names and their respective files. This path looks typical for a Node.js project setup. The node_modules folder is where npm (Node Package Manager) stores third-party libraries, which are essential for many JavaScript applications.\n\nThe specific files created include various .js, .d.ts files, package.json, README.md, and others. These are standard files you'd expect to see in a Node.js module. For example, package.json defines the dependencies and scripts for a project, while the .d.ts files are TypeScript definitions. The presence of these files suggests that someone is setting up or updating their development environment with these modules.\n\nConsidering the timestamps, all events seem to be happening at different times but within a short period. This pattern aligns with Git operations where multiple files might be created in quick succession as part of an update or installation process.\n\nI should also consider if there's anything unusual about the paths or filenames. The folder structure seems legitimate—no obviously malicious file names or locations that are commonly associated with malware or suspicious activities.\n\nAnother thing to note is that all events share the same process name and task type, which reduces the likelihood of this being a distributed attack vector. Instead, it appears to be a single user performing development tasks.\n\nPotential red flags would include things like file creation in unexpected directories, execution of unknown processes, or access to sensitive files. However, node_modules is a standard directory, and creating files there is part of normal npm operations.\n\nAlso, since the process is git.exe, which is widely used and trusted, it's less likely that this activity is malicious unless Git itself was compromised, which isn't indicated here.\n\nIn summary, these events represent a user setting up or updating their Node.js environment using Git.

That's interesting because Git is commonly used for version control, so it's not inherently suspicious.

Yes, when you install npm packages, especially with tools like Yarn or npm, Git might clone repositories and create several files.

It's all within the node_modules folder, which is expected in a project setup.\n\nAlso, the consistency across events—same process name, same task type, similar file structure—doesn't raise red flags. If these were spread out over time or involved different processes, I'd be more cautious, but as a batch from the same operation, it looks normal.\n\nSo putting it all together, this batch doesn't seem to indicate any malicious activity. It's likely just part of a developer's workflow using Git and npm.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation activities by git.exe within a node_modules directory, which is normal during development setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at multiple JSONL entries here, each representing an event on a Windows system. Each line has three main components: process info, winlog details, and file information.\n\nFirst off, all these events have the same \"process\" name: git.exe. That's the Git executable, which is commonly used for version control in software development. It's not unusual to see Git-related processes on a system, especially if someone is working with Node.js or npm packages given the paths involved here.\n\nThe winlog field shows that each event is a \"File created\" task under the rule \"FileCreate\". This means the system is logging the creation of files. Looking at the file paths, they all point to various .js files inside the node_modules directory for a package called tcomb. Node.js modules often require these kinds of operations when installing or updating dependencies.\n\nThe file paths are:\n- C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\fromJSON.js\n- func.js\n- getDefaultInterfaceName.js\n- getFunctionName.js\n- getTypeName.js\n- installTypeFormatter.js\n- interface.js\n- intersection.js\n- irreducible.js\n- is.js\n- isArray.js\n- isBoolean.js\n- isFunction.js\n- isIdentity.js\n- isInterface.js\n- isMaybe.js\n- isNil.js\n\nThese all seem to be JavaScript files related to the tcomb module. Since tcomb is a known library for type checking in Node.js, it's standard for Git processes to create these files during installation or when pulling updates.\n\nNow, considering that all events are from the same process (git.exe) and involve creating files within a typical development environment setup, there doesn't seem to be any signs of malicious activity here. It looks like normal operation related to software development with Node.js and Git.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether repeated file creation in this directory could indicate something suspicious, but since it's part of the expected behavior when modules are installed or updated, it's unlikely. Unless there were unusual times or a high volume of such events beyond what's typical for the system, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nSo putting it all together: same process creating several files in a node_modules directory as part of Git operations. No red flags detected, and this aligns with standard software development workflows.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating multiple JavaScript files within the node_modules\/tcomb directory, which is a normal occurrence during package installation or updates. No signs of malicious activity are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event from the system logs.\n\nFirst, I notice that every event has the same \"process\" field with the name \"git.exe\". That's the Git executable file, which is commonly used for version control in software development. The next part is the \"winlog\" task, which says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So each of these events is indicating that a file was created.\n\nLooking at the files being created, all of them are under the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\". The filenames vary but they all end with .js or .d.ts, which are JavaScript and TypeScript declaration file extensions. These files seem to be part of a Node.js module since the path includes \"node_modules\", which is standard in Node.js projects.\n\nSince Git is involved, it's possible that someone is working on a project using Git for version control. The creation of multiple files under node_modules could be due to installing or updating dependencies. When you run commands like npm install or yarn add, new packages are downloaded and their files are created in the node_modules directory. This is a normal part of the development process.\n\nAnother angle: Could this activity indicate something malicious? Well, Git itself isn't known for being malicious, and the creation of JavaScript\/TypeScript files in a typical project structure doesn't raise red flags. Malware or suspicious activities usually show different patterns, like creating hidden files, accessing unexpected locations, or multiple failed attempts to create files.\n\nThe repetition of similar events with sequential file paths makes me think it's part of a script or automated process during development. For example, installing dependencies might trigger the creation of several files in quick succession, which is exactly what we're seeing here.\n\nI also consider the user context. The path starts with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\", so the user account is 'fiddelis'. If this were a compromised system, I'd expect activity that's not tied to any legitimate user profile, but in this case, it's clearly associated with a user's development work.\n\nLooking at timestamps (if they were provided), if these events occurred over a short period and are part of a known Git or npm process, there wouldn't be much cause for concern. If the timestamps showed irregular activity outside normal working hours, that might warrant further investigation, but without that info, I can't make that assumption.\n\nI also think about whether the files being created could contain malicious code. While it's possible in theory, in this context, they're part of a standard Node.js module named 'tcomb', which is a known package for type checking. So unless there's evidence that 'tcomb' has been tampered with or is part of an attack, these file creations are likely benign.\n\nIn summary, all the events point to normal development activities using Git and npm\/yarn. There's no indication of unauthorized access, malicious behavior, or anomalies that would suggest this batch requires investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by git.exe during software development, specifically within a Node.js project structure. This is expected and not indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
