{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two events where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the data directory. That makes sense because winlogbeat is an agent that collects logs, so it's normal for it to create configuration files or index files. Nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe accessing processes and then creating a known_hosts file under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\.ssh\\known_hosts when using SSH.exe. Wait, but in the logs, it's powershell.exe that's doing this? That seems odd because SSH is typically used for secure shell connections. Why would PowerShell be involved in SSH operations? Maybe it's some automation script, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe creating temporary files and then deleting them. For instance, the file __PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1 is created and then deleted by powershell.exe. This could indicate that PowerShell is running some script to test policies or something similar. But the creation and deletion within a short time frame might raise an eyebrow—could it be trying to avoid detection?\n\nAlso, there are several \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks from powershell.exe without file interactions. I'm not too familiar with what exactly this refers to, but it seems like it's part of PowerShell's initialization process. It might not be malicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe for creating and deleting files, especially in a script-like manner, could be signs of suspicious activity. Additionally, the involvement of SSH.exe accessing known_hosts via powershell.exe is unusual and potentially indicates command execution or some form of remote access being set up.\n\nI'm not entirely certain if these actions are malicious, but they do stand out as abnormal when considering all events together. The confidence level isn't super high because some of these could be legitimate processes, especially with winlogbeat and normal PowerShell operations. However, the combination of file creation\/deletion in temp directories and the use of SSH-related commands via PowerShell makes me lean towards classifying this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating and deleting temporary files, potential suspicious activity with SSH.exe accessing known_hosts file.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of events from system logs that I need to analyze. The goal is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event shows a process named powershell.exe with a task labeled \"Pipe Created.\" That's normal because PowerShell often creates pipes when running commands, especially if it's interacting with other processes or modules. So that doesn't immediately raise any red flags.\n\nNext, there's another event from powershell.exe with the task \"Engine Lifecycle.\" I'm not entirely sure what this means, but I think it refers to the start or stop of the PowerShell engine. Since powershell.exe is a legitimate tool, this seems benign as well.\n\nThe third and fourth events also involve powershell.exe, but they mention \"Image loaded\" for specific files. One is MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which makes sense because Defender often loads various modules when running. The other is urlmon.dll, which I know is related to URL handling in Windows. Both of these are standard system files that PowerShell might load if it's interacting with network resources or running scripts that require them.\n\nMoving on, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is likely part of the ELK stack (Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana), used for log management and analysis. So this process is probably setting up or updating its configuration files. That's normal behavior for a log management tool, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nThe last two events are from svchost.exe, which I know is a generic host process for system services. It created some files in the XboxLive directory under the user profile. This seems like part of normal operation since svchost can run various services, and XboxLive might be related to gaming or user profiles on Windows. The specific file AuthStateCache.dat sounds like it's used for authentication purposes, which is standard for user-related services.\n\nPutting this all together, none of the individual events seem out of place. Each process is performing actions that are expected within their normal operations. There's a healthy amount of PowerShell activity, but as I saw in each case, they're loading legitimate modules and creating pipes—typical behaviors when running scripts or commands through PowerShell.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual file accesses, attempts to load unknown libraries, or processes that aren't supposed to run together. The winlogbeat process is doing what it's designed to do, and svchost is handling its usual tasks. Therefore, the entire batch doesn't indicate any malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes running as expected, including PowerShell and legitimate file operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
