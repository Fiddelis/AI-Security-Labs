{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze as a cybersecurity expert. My job is to determine if this batch is interesting or not for investigation. I need to look at all the events together and decide based on their combination.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first line shows 'powershell.exe' being accessed. PowerShell is often used by both legitimate admins and attackers because it has so much power in scripting and system management. Accessing it could be normal or suspicious depending on context.\n\nNext, there's a process creation for 'whoami.exe', which is typically harmless since it's a standard command to get user info. But if it's being executed with certain parameters or triggered by another malicious process, that might be a red flag.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe accessed again. This repetition could indicate scripting activity, as scripts often run multiple commands in loops or batches.\n\nThen, there's a registry value set by powershell.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure it starts on boot or survives reboots. But sometimes legitimate software also does this for configuration purposes, so I need more context here.\n\nThe next event is crucial: powershell.exe being created with a specific command line. The command includes importing a PowerShell script from a path and executing it. Looking at the script name, \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\", which seems to translate to something like \"auxiliary component\". That's concerning because attackers often use custom scripts for malicious activities.\n\nThe script execution inside powershell.exe is then followed by file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. The files are named with a PS script policy test suffix, which might suggest some form of testing or persistence check. However, creating and immediately deleting files could be part of an attempt to avoid detection or clean up traces.\n\nLooking at the subsequent events, there's a lot of image loading by powershell.exe. These include various DLLs related to .NET frameworks and Windows Defender components. This is normal for PowerShell as it loads these libraries when executing scripts, so on its own, this might not be suspicious, but combined with other actions, it could raise flags.\n\nThere are multiple instances where files are being created and deleted by powershell.exe in the Temp directory, which again could indicate some form of malicious activity like dropping payloads temporarily or creating decoys. The fact that a file is both created and then immediately deleted might suggest an attempt to avoid logging or footprinting.\n\nAnother event shows svchost.exe creating a log file in the SoftwareDistribution DataStore Logs folder. Svchost is a legitimate Windows process, often used by services, so this could be normal unless it's associated with known malicious activity.\n\nLastly, there's a registry value being set again by svchost.exe. This could tie into service configuration or updates but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple powershell.exe processes accessing the system, creating and deleting files in Temp, executing external scripts, loading various DLLs, which can be indicators of malicious behavior. The presence of a custom script being executed, combined with file operations that might suggest persistence or data exfiltration, makes this batch interesting.\n\nI should also consider the volume of events. There are several powershell.exe instances and actions within a short time frame, which could indicate a script running multiple commands as part of its operation. This kind of activity is often seen in attack chains—gaining access, lateral movement, data collection, etc.\n\nThe use of custom scripts (componente_auxiliar.ps1) isn't something that comes up often unless it's part of known tools or APT activities. Without more context on what this script does, it's safer to flag it as suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, the repeated creation and deletion of files in Temp could be an attempt to leave minimal traces or bypass certain security measures. This behavior is common in malware for evading detection.\n\nSo, considering all these factors together, I would lean towards this batch being interesting for investigation because there are multiple red flags related to powershell.exe activity, execution of external scripts, and file operations that could indicate malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits several indicators of potential malicious activity, particularly involving powershell.exe. The key points include:\n\n1. **Multiple Powershell Instances**: Several instances of powershell.exe accessing the system, which can be indicative of scripting or command execution activities.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Powershell.exe setting registry values, a common tactic for persistence mechanisms in malware.\n\n3. **Script Execution**: A custom script (\"componente_auxiliar.ps1\") being executed by powershell.exe, potentially malicious as it could be part of an attack chain.\n\n4. **File Operations**: Creation and deletion of files in the Temp directory, which might suggest attempts to avoid detection or clean up traces.\n\n5. **DLL Loadings**: Loading various DLLs related to .NET frameworks and Windows Defender, while not inherently suspicious, can be part of malicious script activities.\n\n6. **svchost.exe Activity**: Creating log files and modifying registry values, though generally legitimate unless tied to known malicious processes.\n\nGiven these factors, the activity collectively raises concerns about potential malicious intent, especially with the execution of a custom script and repeated file operations in the Temp directory. Therefore, this batch is deemed **interesting** for further investigation.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe batch is **interesting** due to suspicious powershell.exe activities, including script execution and file operations that may indicate malicious intent."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process name is 'svchost.exe'. This is a common system process used by various Windows services. The tasks associated with these processes include registry value sets and file creations in standard locations like C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download. These activities alone don't raise any red flags because svchost.exe is known to perform such operations during normal system updates or maintenance.\n\nThere are also a few entries from other processes like 'powershell.exe' and 'RuntimeBroker.exe'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused by attackers. However, in this case, the task is a file creation related to the user's profile data, which seems standard unless there's more context indicating malicious behavior.\n\nLooking at the files created, they all seem to be within known Windows directories and have names like cache.dat or DLLs, which are typical for system operations. No executable files or scripts in unusual locations are present here.\n\nThe registry value sets don't specify where exactly they were modified, but again, svchost.exe is responsible for many legitimate registry changes during updates. Without specific indicators of compromise (IoCs), it's hard to say these are malicious.\n\nI also notice repeated loading of urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll by multiple processes. These are standard system components used for URL handling andBITS-related tasks. There's no evidence here that they were loaded from unexpected locations or in an unusual manner.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a lot of normal activity related to system updates and legitimate process operations. While it's always good to monitor for anomalies, the patterns here don't indicate any clear signs of malicious behavior. Therefore, I classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes performing legitimate tasks such as registry modifications and file creations in standard locations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. They're all JSONL entries, each with process info, winlog tasks, and file paths where applicable.\n\nFirst, the majority of these events are from svchost.exe, which is a legitimate Windows process used by various services. However, it's known to be often exploited by malware because many services run under this name, making it harder to detect malicious activities.\n\nThe winlog tasks show multiple instances of 'Registry value set' and some 'File created' events. While these aren't inherently suspicious on their own, the combination is important. Malware often modifies registry entries to maintain persistence or change system configurations. The files being created are in locations like Windows Logs, SoftwareDistribution, and ServiceProfiles. These are standard directories for Windows updates and system services, so that's not immediately concerning.\n\nLooking at specific file paths:\n- 'C:\\Windows\\Logs\\waasmedic...' is a known location related to Windows Update Antimalware Scan Interface (WSAI), which isn't suspicious.\n- The entries under SoftwareDistribution could be part of update processes or delivery optimization.\n- The Cache directory under NetworkService's AppData seems standard for certain services.\n\nHowever, the sheer number of events—many repeated instances—is notable. If svchost.exe is performing a lot of registry modifications and file creations in quick succession, it might indicate unusual behavior, especially if these tasks are out of the ordinary for typical system operations.\n\nAnother point is that some entries have 'None' for process or file info, which could be incomplete logs but might also mask malicious activities if an attacker is attempting to avoid logging certain details.\n\nConsidering all this, while no single event stands out as definitively malicious, the volume and combination of registry modifications and file creations by svchost.exe warrant attention. This could potentially indicate a system compromise or malicious activity trying to stay under the radar.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe performing Registry value set operations and creating files in various locations, which may indicate potential malicious activity or unusual system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from svchost.exe. Svchost is a common Windows process that hosts other services, so it's not unusual for it to perform tasks like registry operations or file creation. The first log shows the registry being modified, and then files being created in \"C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install\". That directory seems related to software updates or patches. The second entry under svchost creates a specific path with an .exe file, which might be part of an update process.\n\nNext, there are several logs from MpSigStub.exe. This is likely the Windows Defender process. It's creating multiple files in the Temp folder with GUID-based names. These look like temporary files related to updates or patches being applied. The filenames include terms like \"mpasdlta\" and \"mpavdlta\", which I think relate to antivirus update deltas. Defender often creates such files when downloading or applying updates, so this is normal behavior.\n\nThen, setup.exe appears multiple times. This is typically used for installing software. The paths point to Microsoft Edge Core components, like BHO stubs and other services. Each file created seems to be part of the installation process for Edge. These are legitimate actions during an update or installation.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe modifying a registry value isn't unusual either. It's involved in managing runtime aspects of Windows features and can access or modify registry entries as part of its operation.\n\nLastly, powershell.exe being accessed is common and could be used for various legitimate tasks by system administrators or scripts. Without more context, it's hard to say if this was malicious, but standalone process access isn't necessarily suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The logs show normal system processes like svchost, Defender updates, Edge installations, and runtime management. No signs of unauthorized access, encryption, data exfiltration, or other red flags typical of malware. All the activities are within expected baselines for a Windows system undergoing updates and installations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes related to software updates and installation.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 0\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. I'll start by analyzing each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving `whoami.exe` and `powershell.exe`. The initial event shows `whoami.exe` being executed, which is usually benign but can be used for reconnaissance. Notably, the command line for the PowerShell process looks suspicious—it's using a script that creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to an unfamiliar location: `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`. This seems like it could be attempting to create a persistent backdoor or malicious service.\n\nNext, there are several events where `powershell.exe` accesses the registry and creates files in temporary directories. For instance, it creates a file named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1`, then immediately deletes it. This behavior is concerning because creating and deleting scripts quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple image loads from the .NET framework and Windows Defender components. While this isn't inherently malicious, combined with other suspicious activities, it raises flags about potential code injection or abuse of legitimate processes.\n\nThe events involving `services.exe` writing to the registry repeatedly could indicate an attempt to modify system services, which is often a sign of malicious activity aiming for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nPutting all these pieces together—suspicious script execution, rapid file creation\/deletion, service creation attempts, and repeated registry modifications—it's clear that this batch of logs shows signs of potentially malicious behavior. The activities align with common tactics used in cyberattacks, such as creating backdoors, dropping malware, or attempting persistence mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" due to the combination of these events suggesting a possible attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell executing suspicious commands, including creating a service and deleting temporary files, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial events show a process named \"tarefa_logico.exe\" loading several DLL files related to .NET Framework. These look like standard operations since those DLLs are part of the .NET environment. No immediate red flags here, but I'll keep an eye on how this process behaves further.\n\nThen, there's an event involving powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That path seems a bit off because it's not a commonly used location for PowerShell profiles. This might be something to look into, as unusual file creations can indicate malicious activity.\n\nNext, I see two events where \"Execute a Remote Command\" is logged. The paths mentioned are C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. That's an unfamiliar location and the script name is somewhat generic, but without context, it's hard to say. However, executing remote commands can be risky if not authorized.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events with powershell.exe running a command that imports a module from C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1 and invoking Invoke-entrada_principal. The repeated use of the same script is concerning. Also, the fact that it's using try-catch blocks and exiting with HResult suggests they're trying to handle errors, which could be a sign of obfuscation or attempting to avoid detection.\n\nThe command line in these events is quite long and repetitive, which might indicate automation or a script being executed multiple times. The use of \"&\" to run the command directly without showing it in the console is another point that stands out—this is a common tactic used in malicious scripts to hide their activity from users.\n\nAdditionally, the file paths are structured in a way that seems designed to make them look legitimate but might be masking where the actual files reside. The nesting of \"registro_secundario\" within other directories could be an attempt to blend in or avoid standard scanning practices.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it's likely that there's malicious activity here. Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially harmful scripts, combined with attempts to handle exceptions and hide their actions, point towards a possible attack vector such as remote execution or script-based malware.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious PowerShell activity including remote command executions, repeated script imports, and error handling mechanisms indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. There are 19 JSONL entries here. The first event shows a PowerShell command executing some script. The path mentioned is C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. That seems like an unusual path with \"registro\" which translates to \"registry\" in Portuguese, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.\n\nLooking at the process events, the command line shows a PowerShell script creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" using New-Service and then starting it. This happens multiple times—six entries show this exact same command. The task field alternates between 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle'. I know that services can be legitimate, but so many repeated attempts to create the same service might indicate something suspicious.\n\nThen there's a different event where PowerShell is used to import a module from another path and call a function. This happens once in the first line. The rest of the events (lines 10-19) have no process information but show 'Execute a Remote Command' in the task field, pointing to the same script file.\n\nSo putting it all together: multiple attempts to create a service with the same name using PowerShell scripts from specific paths could be signs of malicious activity. The repeated use suggests persistence or installation of a backdoor. Also, the import-module command might be attempting to load malicious code. Since these actions are common in APTs or malware for persistence and remote execution, this batch is definitely interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated attempts to create a service named \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" using PowerShell scripts from specific paths. This could indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence or backdoor installation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is something I should look into. So, first off, there are multiple JSON objects here, each representing an event from system logs, probably Windows since the keys like 'winlog' and file paths with backslashes suggest that.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they all have \"process\": \"None\" except for one where it's \"services.exe\". The 'winlog' field varies. Most of them are about executing remote commands, which is a bit concerning because that could be indicative of remote access or command execution, often a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an event with \"Security Group Management\", which might be normal admin activity but could also relate to privilege escalation. Additionally, some events mention 'Special Logon', which in Windows usually refers to logons by system services or other non-interactive sessions, which is not typical for user logins and could be suspicious if happening too frequently.\n\nThe file path mentioned consistently across many events is \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The fact that the same script is being executed multiple times in quick succession raises a red flag. PowerShell scripts executing remotely are often used for malicious purposes because they can execute code, download files, or perform actions that are hard to trace.\n\nI should also consider how many of these events there are. There's a lot—over 20 instances where the same script is being executed as a remote command. That repetition makes me think it's not just an accidental trigger but possibly part of a larger campaign or automated attack.\n\nAnother point is that some events involve 'services.exe', which is a legitimate Windows process, but when combined with other suspicious activities like special logons and repeated remote commands, it could indicate that the attacker is using legitimate processes for malicious purposes, making it harder to detect.\n\nLooking at the timestamps would help, but since they're not provided, I have to rely on frequency and type. The consistent execution of the same script across so many events suggests a possible persistence mechanism or part of an attack chain where the script is being dropped and executed multiple times.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows a lot of activity that doesn't seem normal. Multiple remote command executions, special logons, and repeated access to the same file path are all signs that could point to malicious behavior. The repetition and combination of these events make it more than just some anomalies—they suggest a potential attack in progress or post-attack activities.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while each individual event might not be highly suspicious, the pattern across them indicates something worth investigating further. The confidence level isn't 100% certain yet, but given the volume and nature of events, it's high enough to warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of remote command execution targeting the same script file suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs provided in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event, and there are 18 events in total. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. The structure of each event includes three fields: process, winlog, and file. \n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all have \"process\": \"None\", which probably means that no specific process was detected or logged in these events. Then, under \"winlog\", there's a task field with different values. The majority of the events (up to line 14) show the task as \"Execute a Remote Command\". Only two events at lines 16 and 17 have \"Windows Update Agent\" as the task.\n\nThe file field is present in most events, pointing to the same path: \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". This path seems suspicious because it's a PowerShell script located in a directory that translates roughly to \"Logical Unit Secondary Record Auxiliary Component\" which doesn't sound like standard system files. The fact that the same file is referenced repeatedly might indicate that this script is being executed multiple times, possibly as part of automated or malicious activity.\n\nI also notice that after line 16 and 17, there are no further entries in the file field for those two events. This could mean that during these instances, no specific file was associated with the task, which might be normal if it's related to Windows updates but unusual if it's part of a malicious process.\n\nConsidering the repetition of the same file path and the \"Execute a Remote Command\" task, this pattern raises red flags. Malware often executes scripts repeatedly as part of its payload delivery or execution. The fact that all these events are occurring in quick succession (assuming they're timestamped closely) might indicate an active infection or malicious activity.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the possibility that this could be a legitimate script running as part of system operations. For example, certain automated scripts run periodically, and Windows Update Agent tasks are standard for system updates. But the combination of multiple remote command executions and the same file path makes me lean towards this being suspicious.\n\nAnother angle to think about is whether these events correlate with known indicators of compromise (IoCs). The file path includes \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\", which doesn't ring any specific bells, but it's common for attackers to use custom scripts that don't have easily identifiable names. However, the repeated execution could still be a sign.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility of log injection or false positives, where an attacker's tools generate such logs to mask their activities or as part of a larger campaign. In this case, the uniformity in file paths and task types might not just be random but part of a coordinated attack.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of repeated remote command executions and the same file path suggests potential malicious behavior that merits further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated execution of a PowerShell script, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
