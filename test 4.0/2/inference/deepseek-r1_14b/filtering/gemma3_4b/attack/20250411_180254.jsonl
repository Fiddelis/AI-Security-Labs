Let's go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal for a browser; it needs to resolve domains. Not suspicious.\n\nNext up is powershell.exe making a registry change. PowerShell can do a lot, good and bad. Registry changes alone aren't unusual, especially in legitimate scripts or configurations. But I'll keep an eye on how this behaves with others.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe running systeminfo and querying the registry. Systeminfo is a common tool for gathering system info, which could be part of an information-gathering phase by attackers. The registry query might be looking for specific services or configurations. This combination seems potentially suspicious but needs more context.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event with process access. This could mean it's interacting with another process, maybe trying to elevate privileges or inject code. But again, without seeing malicious behavior, it's hard to tell.\n\nCmd.exe again doing a registry set. Could be part of legitimate administration, like script execution. Still, multiple such events might indicate something's amiss.\n\nsysteminfo.exe creating a process and loading images. Since systeminfo is usually benign, unless it's being used as a loader for malicious components, which isn't evident here.\n\nNotepad.exe making a registry change—this seems odd because Notepad is a text editor and shouldn't be modifying the registry directly. Unless it's running a script, but that might not be standard behavior. Could be a sign of something fishy.\n\nsvchost.exe doing multiple registry writes and file creations in log files. Svchost is a common system process, often used by legitimate services, but it can also be abused by malware to hide processes or modify system settings. The repeated writes and the creation of logs might be part of normal operations or an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nWmiPrvSE.exe creating a process and loading modules. This is related to WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation), which can be a vector for attacks. Malware often uses WMI for persistence, so this event raises my concern, especially since it's using -secured and -Embedding flags in the command line.\n\nConhost.exe making a registry change—conhost is part of the console subsystem. It shouldn't typically modify the registry, so this could be an indicator of malicious activity trying to hide or set up persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at all these together, there are several red flags: multiple instances of cmd and powershell with suspicious commands, systeminfo and reg.exe being used for querying sensitive information, notepad modifying the registry (which it shouldn't do), and svchost along with WmiPrvSE making changes that could indicate persistence or privilege escalation. The combination suggests a potential attack where an adversary is gathering info, trying to access restricted areas, and setting up backdoors.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the sequence of events doesn't seem normal for everyday user activity. The use of multiple tools in a way that's not typical, along with targeting sensitive system areas like the registry and WMI, points towards possible malicious intent. My confidence is high but not certain without more data, so I'd rate it around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events indicating potentially suspicious activity such as registry modifications by cmd.exe and powershell.exe, process creations of systeminfo.exe and WmiPrvSE.exe with specific command lines, and file operations that may suggest information gathering or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is usually used for logging, so that seems normal. The next one is ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting a registry value. That's also standard since it's part of the shell infrastructure.\n\nThen there are multiple events from powershell.exe and Calculator.exe setting registry values. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be malicious if used inappropriately. However, without more context, these could just be normal operations or script executions.\n\nLooking further down, I see several instances where chrome.exe is involved. Chrome doing a lot of registry writes might be unusual because browsers typically don't modify the registry that much during normal operation. This repetition makes me wonder if there's something suspicious here, like potential persistence mechanisms or malicious activity trying to hide itself by modifying system configurations.\n\nThere are also events where chrome.exe loads modules like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are legitimate Windows components for antivirus and antispyware. That doesn't raise red flags on its own. However, combined with the excessive registry writes, it could indicate some form of unauthorized access or an attempt to alter system behavior.\n\nAnother point is that there are two events where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the same path. This might be normal if the log rotation process is happening, but it's worth noting as repeated file creation could sometimes be part of malicious activity trying to write logs repeatedly for some reason.\n\nAdditionally, powershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_padrao.txt' is interesting. The filename doesn't immediately ring any bells, but PowerShell has administrative privileges and can execute scripts, so this could be a sign of command execution or file creation as part of malicious activities like persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple registry writes from different processes, especially Chrome doing it repeatedly, could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations in a way that's not typical. The combination with PowerShell and file operations adds more layers of potential concern. While each individual event might seem benign, the overall pattern suggests possible malicious behavior.\n\nI'm not entirely certain because some activities like registry writes can be part of legitimate software updates or installations. However, the volume and specific processes involved make it worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events including excessive registry modifications by Chrome.exe, file creation by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what I need to do here. The user has provided a JSONL event that includes details about a process named chrome.exe setting a registry value through the Windows event log. They want me to analyze this batch and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I should understand each part of the event. The process is chrome.exe, which is a legitimate application, so that seems normal. The Windows log indicates that a registry value was set, which is a common activity for many applications during installation or configuration.\n\nI need to consider if setting registry values by Chrome is typical behavior. From what I know, Chrome does modify the registry when updating settings or extensions, so this isn't unusual. There's no indication here of any malicious activity, like multiple writes in quick succession or access to restricted areas.\n\nI should also think about whether there are other events in the batch that might change the classification, but since each line is individual, I can only assess this single event. Without more context, it's hard to see red flags. Maybe if Chrome was accessing unexpected registry keys, it could be concerning, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: a legitimate process modifying the registry is normal and doesn't raise any alarms. Therefore, the batch isn't interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The event indicates Chrome.exe setting a registry value, which is a common and legitimate activity for applications during configuration or updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
