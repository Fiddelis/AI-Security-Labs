That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and script-based attacks. The fact that it's accessed several times might indicate something malicious, but without more context on what exactly it's doing, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nThen I see cmd.exe and sc.exe being used in commands. For example, the command line for cmd.exe is \"\/c sc create win32times binPath= \"cmd \/c start c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\"\" which looks suspicious because it's creating a new service using sc.exe and setting its binary path to execute another script. The script mentioned (\"NonExistingScript.ps1\") doesn't exist, so this might be an attempt to create a persistent backdoor or something malicious.\n\nThere are also several entries where Registry values are being set by various processes like services.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and svchost.exe. This activity in the registry could be part of creating or modifying service entries, which is common in persistence mechanisms for malware. Multiple writes might indicate an attacker trying to establish long-term access.\n\nAdditionally, there's a process where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the user's directory, but that seems like it's from legitimate software used for log management, so probably not malicious unless it's behaving unusually, which isn't evident here.\n\nTaking all these together—the use of PowerShell, cmd with sc.exe to create services pointing to non-existent scripts, and multiple registry writes—it's likely indicative of potential malicious activity. The repeated attempts to set up services and registry entries suggest an attacker trying to establish persistence or execute arbitrary code. While I'm not 100% certain without deeper analysis, there's enough unusual behavior to warrant closer examination.\n\nSo, my confidence is high but not absolute. There might be non-malicious reasons for some of these actions, but the combination makes it interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious process activity including PowerShell.exe access and cmd.exe commands creating services with non-existent scripts. Registry value modifications by various processes suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The first few entries show processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe setting registry values. Setting registry values can be normal, but in some cases, it could indicate malicious activity. However, these alone don't raise immediate red flags because legitimate software often modifies the registry.\n\nNext, I notice that powershell.exe is accessing a process (ProcessAccess). PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. So this event catches my attention. It's important to see what exactly happened when it accessed another process.\n\nThen there are multiple events from chrome.exe setting registry values and creating pipes. While Chrome is a standard application, the number of registry modifications might be unusual. Additionally, the ImageLoad events for amsi.dll could be significant because AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) is used by Windows to detect malicious code. If an attacker tries to load this DLL through a malicious process, it might be an attempt to bypass detection.\n\nLooking at the repeated RegistryEvent tasks in chrome.exe, multiple writes can indicate something suspicious. Malware often creates multiple registry entries as part of its installation or configuration process. The ImageLoad for MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender, which seems normal, but paired with other events, it's worth noting.\n\nAlso, there are two ProcessAccess events related to powershell.exe. This could mean that powershell is being used to interact with other processes, possibly to inject code or gather information, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple registry modifications by different processes, especially chrome.exe and powershell.exe, along with attempts to load system DLLs, raises concerns about potential malicious activity. While individual events might not be alarming, the combination suggests possible investigation is needed.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry modifications by different processes (including chrome.exe and powershell.exe), along with an attempt to load amsi.dll, which could indicate potential malicious activity or attempts to bypass security mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
