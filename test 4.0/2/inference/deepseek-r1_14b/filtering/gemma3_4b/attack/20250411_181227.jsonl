{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. I'm seeing a batch of events that all involve powershell.exe processes, which immediately raises my suspicion because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the command lines, several entries show Powershell executing scheduled tasks with calc.exe as the action. The fact that they're creating scheduled tasks on system startup (AtLogon trigger) and using the Administrators group with highest privileges suggests an attempt to maintain persistence. This is a classic tactic for malware to ensure it runs at every user logon.\n\nAdditionally, multiple registry writes are happening, which further supports the idea of setting up persistent tasks. The repetitive creation of scheduled tasks with slightly different names (like unidade_ativo$object or pacote_logico$object) indicates an effort to create multiple backdoors, possibly to evade detection or ensure one survives even if another is removed.\n\nThere's also a process where mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll are loaded. These are part of the .NET framework, but in some cases, they can be used by malicious scripts to execute code. The fact that these DLLs are being loaded during Powershell execution might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with the other activities, it adds another layer.\n\nWhile I don't see any direct evidence of malicious payload execution beyond calc.exe (which is often a test or part of a proof-of-concept), the overall pattern—using elevated privileges, creating multiple persistent tasks, and registry modifications—is indicative of potentially harmful behavior. Malicious actors often use such techniques to ensure their code runs at every system restart.\n\nThe lack of other events like file creations or network communications might mean that this is just the initial phase of an attack focusing on persistence. However, given the nature of the activities observed, it's prudent to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks at logon with elevated privileges and unusual naming conventions, which may indicate persistence mechanisms or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this batch of system log events. I'm looking to determine if these events are interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nFirst, the logs show multiple instances of PowerShell.exe activities. Notably, there are several entries where PowerShell is loading different DLLs. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be a vector for attacks, so this catches my attention. I should check what those DLLs are. The paths like Microsoft.NET and Windows Defender seem normal, but sometimes attackers might load malicious modules or use reflective DLL injection.\n\nThen there's a file creation and subsequent deletion of a PowerShell script in the Temp directory. This is a red flag because attackers often create temporary scripts to execute malicious commands and then delete them to cover their tracks. The filename __PSScriptPolicyTest sounds like it could be part of some automated test, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is benign or suspicious.\n\nAnother event shows PowerShell.exe executing a scheduled task that runs calc.exe at logon with high privileges. Using Scheduled Tasks with administrative accounts can be risky because it allows persistence across reboots. The command creates a new scheduled task with an action to execute calc.exe, which seems harmless, but the use of administrative groups could indicate privilege escalation if this were part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple registry writes from chrome.exe. While Chrome does modify the registry for updates and settings, multiple writes in quick succession might be unusual. However, without knowing the exact changes made, it's hard to assess their impact. But considering that Chrome is a common target for attacks, especially supply-chain ones, this could be worth monitoring.\n\nThe latter part of the logs shows several events where 'Execute a Remote Command' was triggered with no process or file context. This is concerning because remote command execution can indicate an active attack, like over RDP or via another protocol. The lack of associated processes makes it harder to trace but doesn't necessarily make it any less suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: PowerShell activities, especially the scheduled task creation and temporary script handling, could be signs of malicious activity. The remote command executions are particularly worrying as they suggest potential unauthorized access or command execution. While some events might be legitimate (like Chrome updates), the combination raises enough red flags to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious PowerShell activities, including loading DLLs and creating\/deleting a temporary script, which may indicate malicious behavior. Additionally, there are multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process or file context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

Let me start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the 'winlog' task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That sounds suspicious because executing remote commands can be a sign of malicious activity, like command-and-control (C2) communication. But I need to look at these in context with other events.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where 'process' shows powershell.exe being executed with some command line arguments. The script creates a scheduled task that runs calc.exe on logon, with high privileges for the Administrators group. That seems concerning because using Powershell to create a persistent scheduled task is a common tactic in attacks—this could be creating a backdoor.\n\nThen there's an event where WmiPrvSE.exe loads taskschd.dll. I remember that WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation and can sometimes be used by attackers for persistence or privilege escalation. The fact that it's loading a task scheduling DLL adds more concern about potential malicious activity.\n\nNext, several svchost.exe processes are setting registry values. SvcHost is a legitimate process but often exploited by malware because it runs with system-level privileges. Multiple registry writes could be part of installing a persistence mechanism or modifying system configurations maliciously.\n\nAnother event shows svchost.exe creating a file in the Tasks folder named 'unidade_comum'. This seems like an unusual filename, and since it's created by svchost, which is often used by malware, this could indicate that a new scheduled task is being set up without proper authorization.\n\nThere are other events involving chrome.exe loading DLLs and registry writes. While Chrome can trigger these types of logs normally, the combination with previous suspicious activities makes me think there might be more to it, but I'm not sure if these are part of an attack or just regular operation.\n\nAdditionally, powershell.exe is creating a file in the user's AppData folder, which could be dropping malicious scripts. Also, winlogbeat.exe creating a config file isn't inherently suspicious unless it's being used for something nefarious, but that seems less likely here.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated remote command executions, use of Powershell to create a scheduled task with high privileges, WmiPrvSE activity, and svchost registry modifications all point towards potential malicious behavior. The persistence mechanisms (scheduled tasks) are red flags because attackers often use them to maintain access over time.\n\nI'm confident that this batch shows signs of an attack or at least suspicious activities that need investigation. So, I'd classify it as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple indicators suggest potential malicious activity, including remote command executions, creation of a scheduled task using PowerShell with elevated privileges, and unusual file and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first seven entries all involve \"chrome.exe\" setting registry values. That seems a bit repetitive. I know that Chrome sometimes modifies the registry for settings and extensions, but seeing it happen so many times in a row might be suspicious. However, it's also possible that this is just normal operation if Chrome is being updated or configured.\n\nThe eighth event is different; it's another \"chrome.exe\" process but this time it's making a DNS query. DNS queries are common for web browsing, so not sure if that stands out on its own. Maybe part of the same activity as before.\n\nThen there are two more events. The ninth entry shows \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the data directory with .new extension. That looks like it's part of the normal operation of the winlogbeat service, which is responsible for collecting logs. So probably not malicious.\n\nThe last event is \"powershell.exe\" creating a new file named \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\". PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful, but just creating a file isn't enough to conclude anything. It could be legitimate admin work or part of an attack. The filename doesn't immediately raise red flags, but I'm cautious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry writes from Chrome might indicate some activity, especially if they're happening in quick succession. The DNS query and the PowerShell file creation are a bit more concerning, though not conclusive. However, considering that these could all be part of normal user activities or legitimate scripts, the overall batch doesn't have enough clear indicators of malicious behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because individually each event might seem suspicious, but together they don't form a cohesive pattern of an attack. There's no evidence of multiple stages of an exploit, unusual file operations beyond what could be normal, or any signs of communication with external servers that would raise the red flags higher.\n\nSo, my classification is NOT INTERESTING because while there are some potentially concerning actions, they don't combine to form a clear indication of malicious activity when considered as a whole batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include normal system activities such as registry modifications by Chrome, DNS queries, and file creations by legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe and PowerShell. There are no clear indicators of malicious behavior in the provided logs.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
