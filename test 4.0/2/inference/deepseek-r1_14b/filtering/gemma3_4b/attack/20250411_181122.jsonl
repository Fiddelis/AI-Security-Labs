{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system events. First off, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. That immediately raises some flags because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities.\n\nLooking deeper, the command lines in these events show that powershell.exe is being executed with specific arguments. The script seems to be searching for strings related to passwords in various file types like .xml, .doc, .txt, and .xls. This pattern could indicate someone trying to harvest sensitive information.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances where the same command line is used across different events. Repetition of such commands might suggest automated or script-based activity, which isn't necessarily bad on its own, but combined with the content of the scripts, it becomes more suspicious.\n\nI also see that files are being created and then deleted in a short timeframe. The creation of temporary files followed by their deletion could be an attempt to hide traces of malicious activities. This behavior is common in malware to avoid detection.\n\nThe events show several registry accesses and modifications. Powershell has the capability to interact with the Windows Registry, which can be used for persistence mechanisms—meaning the attackers might be trying to ensure that their script runs on every boot or at regular intervals.\n\nFurthermore, there are multiple Image Load events for different DLLs related to .NET Framework. While this isn't inherently malicious, it could indicate that the PowerShell script is executing code that relies on these libraries, which might be obfuscating its true intent.\n\nPutting all these pieces together—the repeated use of powershell.exe with specific commands targeting sensitive data, file creation and deletion, registry interactions, and potential use of .NET components—it seems like a coordinated attempt to gather credentials or other sensitive information. This kind of activity is often indicative of a breach or an attack.\n\nI'm confident that this batch of events shows signs of malicious behavior, so it definitely warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances executing suspicious commands targeting password-related strings across various file types.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. I'll go through each event step by step and look for patterns or signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them involve processes like notepad.exe, calc.exe, chrome.exe, and various system processes like svchost.exe and conhost.exe. These are common applications and system components, so their activities alone aren't suspicious unless they're doing something out of the ordinary.\n\nHowever, I notice multiple entries related to powershell.exe with specific command lines. The command line arguments in the process events for powershell.exe catch my attention. For example:\n- `powershell.exe & {findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls\\\\nls -R | select-string -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Pattern password}`\nThis looks like a script that's searching through various file types (XML, DOC, TXT, XLS) for the word \"pass\" and then using select-string to find patterns matching \"password.\" This could be an attempt to harvest passwords from these files, which is a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessing different files and registry keys. Such repeated activity by powershell.exe might indicate persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration attempts. Powershell is often used in attacks because it's legitimate and has powerful scripting capabilities, making it hard to detect when abused.\n\nOther events involve processes like findstr.exe being spawned from powershell, which further supports the idea of script execution. The use of command-line tools like findstr for searching files could be part of a larger malicious payload trying to gather sensitive information.\n\nLooking at the file operations and registry changes, especially by non-standard processes like powershell.exe, adds to the concern. Malicious actors often use legitimate tools and processes to hide their tracks and achieve persistence.\n\nWhile some events seem benign (like notepad.exe modifying the registry or calc.exe loading a system DLL), the combination of multiple suspicious powershell activities suggests a potential attack vector. The repeated command lines and the nature of the commands point towards data gathering or exfiltration, which are key indicators of possible malicious behavior.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not be alarming, the cumulative evidence—especially the pattern of powershell.exe executing specific scripts that search for passwords in various files—strongly suggests this batch is worth investigating further. The confidence level is high due to the clear signs of potential data theft or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including searching for sensitive information and repeated process accesses, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are from 'chrome.exe'. The tasks include things like 'Registry value set', 'Dns query', 'Image loaded', and 'Network connection detected'. These are pretty common activities for a web browser. For example, Chrome might set registry values during installation or updates, perform DNS queries to resolve website addresses, load system DLLs for functionality, and establish network connections to communicate with servers.\n\nThere's also an event from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file. Winlogbeat is likely the tool used to collect these logs, so it makes sense that it would create files in its data directory. No red flags there.\n\nThen there are a couple of events from 'powershell.exe'. One of them creates a file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious purposes. However, without more context, creating a file isn't inherently suspicious. It could just be part of a script or user action.\n\nI notice that all events are from the same user ('fiddelis'), which might indicate normal activity rather than multiple users possibly indicating lateral movement in an attack.\n\nThe repetition of 'chrome.exe' performing registry writes and DNS queries stands out, but again, these activities alone aren't malicious. They could be part of legitimate operations or updates. The only thing that might raise an eyebrow is the number of registry writes—so many in a short period could suggest something unusual, but without knowing the baseline for this system, it's hard to say.\n\nI don't see any events indicating known malicious behaviors like file deletions, process creations from unknown paths, or network communications to suspicious domains. The lack of such indicators makes me lean towards these being normal activities.\n\nIn conclusion, while some actions could be considered if they occurred in isolation, the entire batch doesn't present a clear pattern of malicious behavior. Therefore, I classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are typical for a web browser like Chrome and do not indicate any suspicious or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the events involve various processes like powershell.exe, winlogbeat.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, and conhost.exe. The tasks include file creation, process access, process creation, image loading, and registry events.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe creates a file named 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. Creating a file might be part of script execution or data collection.\n\nThe second event is winlogbeat.exe creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file. Winlogbeat is likely an agent that's supposed to collect logs, so this seems normal unless it's being misused.\n\nLooking through the events, I notice multiple instances where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. This behavior could be suspicious because PowerShell can execute commands and modify system configurations, which is common in attacks for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThere are several cmd.exe command lines that delete scheduled tasks (schtasks). For example, deleting a task named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" using schtasks. Deleting system tasks might indicate an attempt to remove traces of malicious activities or disrupt normal operations.\n\nAnother event shows cmd.exe trying to delete the notepad.exe process with wmic. This is unusual because Notepad isn't typically associated with malicious behavior, but deleting processes can be a sign of process termination for hiding activity.\n\nThe schtasks.exe events show multiple deletions of tasks, which could be part of an attack trying to remove scheduled jobs that might be used later for persistence or other malicious activities. The fact that the same commands are repeated also suggests automation or scripting, possibly from a toolset used by attackers.\n\nRegistry modifications by svchost.exe and conhost.exe are notable because svchost is a legitimate Windows process but can be abused to load malicious DLLs or modify registry entries for persistence.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating files with PowerShell, deleting system tasks via cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, accessing processes, and modifying the registry suggests potential malicious activity. These actions could be part of an attack chain aiming to establish persistence, disrupt normal operations, or hide evidence. The repetition of certain commands also raises suspicion as it indicates a pattern that might not occur naturally in benign activities.\n\nTherefore, this batch of events is classified as interesting because they collectively show signs of potentially malicious behavior, such as process deletion, registry modifications, and file creation by scripts known for their dual-use capabilities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including PowerShell execution, file creation, process deletions using cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, and registry modifications which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes. Let me start by looking through each event carefully.\n\nThe first event involves WMIC.exe deleting Notepad.exe. That's a red flag because WMIC is often used by attackers for command and control. Deleting processes can be part of lateral movement or cleanup after an attack.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where WMIC loads different DLLs like urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. This could indicate the use of legitimate system functions but might also be a way to bypass detection mechanisms or load malicious components.\n\nThen I see PowerShell being used with registry access and process creation. Powershell is common in attacks for its scripting capabilities. The fact that it's accessing registries and other processes might be part of establishing persistence or lateral movement.\n\nThere are cmd.exe commands deleting user accounts, which could be an attempt to remove traces or escalate privileges. Using net.exe and net1.exe to delete users suggests a concerted effort to manipulate system accounts, possibly for privilege escalation or to cover tracks.\n\nMultiple instances of conhost.exe and whoami.exe running might indicate legitimate usage, but they can also be part of mimicking legitimate processes or gathering information about the system.\n\nLooking at the later events, there are several entries where process names aren't specified. These seem related to user account management and security groups. While these could be routine admin tasks, the combination with other suspicious activities might make them notable.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of deleting users, using WMIC for process deletion and DLL loading, PowerShell activity, and command-line tools like cmd.exe and net.exe suggest possible malicious behavior. The variety of commands and processes involved points towards potential attack vectors like privilege escalation, lateral movement, or system compromise.\n\nHowever, I need to balance this with the possibility that some of these actions could be from legitimate admin activities, especially if they're part of routine maintenance or scripts. But considering the frequency and types of events, especially the deletion commands and use of tools commonly associated with attacks, it's more likely than not that this batch is indicative of malicious activity.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it contains multiple red flags that together suggest potential security issues.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of potentially malicious activities including process deletions, DLL loadings, and user account management using tools like WMIC.exe, PowerShell, cmd.exe, and net.exe.

Let's look at each event.\n\nStarting with the first event, it mentions \"User Account Management\" in the winlog task. That could be related to user activity or changes, which might be suspicious but alone isn't enough.\n\nNext, there are multiple powershell.exe and cmd.exe processes accessing registry values or creating new processes. Powershell is often used for malicious activities because it's versatile. The command lines like \"\/c net user ... \/del \/domain\" suggest attempts to delete user accounts, which could indicate an attack trying to remove traces or elevate privileges.\n\nLooking further, I see several instances of 'net.exe' and 'cmd.exe' deleting users, along with other commands like 'sc delete win32times'. These look like they're part of a script to clean up logs or services. The repeated use of RegistryEvent tasks suggests tampering with system configurations, which is concerning.\n\nThe events involving 'whoami.exe' might be checking the current user context, possibly for lateral movement. Combining all these actions—deleting users, modifying registry entries, and using command-line tools—it seems like a coordinated attack. The volume of such activities within a short time frame increases suspicion.\n\nI don't see any legitimate reason for so many account deletions and system changes in quick succession.

Next, there's powershell.exe being accessed, which is often used by attackers for its scripting capabilities. Then another cmd.exe event where it sets a registry value—that could be modifying system settings to maintain persistence.\n\nThere are multiple events where powershell.exe is involved in various tasks: accessing processes, setting registry values, and loading different images. The repeated use of powershell.exe and the specific command lines like \"& {}\" might indicate some automated or script-based activity, which can be a red flag for potential malicious behavior.\n\nI also notice several \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events from powershell.exe.

They all seem to involve processes like powershell.exe and whoami.exe, which are commonly used for legitimate purposes but can also be indicators of malicious activity.\n\nFirst, there's a lot of PowerShell activity—loading images, creating files, accessing processes. Notably, the file paths mentioned are related to Windows Defender and PowerShell profiles, which might seem normal. But I should check if these activities are out of the ordinary for this system. The creation and deletion of temporary files by PowerShell could be part of script execution, which raises a red flag because attackers often use scripts to execute malicious commands.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances where whoami.exe is executed, which is typically used to get user information. If this is happening alongside PowerShell, it might indicate an attempt to gather system info or escalate privileges. The repeated process accesses by PowerShell could mean it's trying to interact with other processes, possibly for persistence or lateral movement.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level here.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze as part of detecting potential malicious behavior. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is relevant for investigation. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with only one classification—either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\"—along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll start by reviewing each event carefully. Each line represents a separate JSON object, so I need to parse them individually while considering the entire batch as a whole.\n\nLooking at the first event:\n- Process: whoami.exe was executed from C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe.\n- Winlog task: Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate).\n- No file information.\n\nWhoami.exe is typically a legitimate system utility used to display user information. However, in some cases, it can be used maliciously if it's part of an escalation or persistence mechanism. The command line seems standard, so nothing immediately suspicious here.\n\nSecond event:\n- Process: powershell.exe.\n- Winlog task: Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess).\n- No file info.\n\nPowershell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for script execution and lateral movement. The fact that it's being accessed could be normal admin activity or part of an attack. I'll keep this in mind but not flag it yet.\n\nThird event:\n- Process: RuntimeBroker.exe.\n- Winlog task: Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent).\n- No file info.\n\nRuntimeBroker is a known Windows process related to app containers and user profiles. Modifying registry values might be part of its normal operation, so this doesn't seem concerning on its own.\n\nFourth event:\n- Process: notepad.exe.\n- Winlog task: Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent).\n- No file info.\n\nNotepad is a benign application, but seeing it modifying the registry could be unusual. However, without additional context, I'm cautious but not immediately concerned.\n\nFifth event:\n- Powershell.exe accessed again.\n\nThis repetition might indicate something more, but powershell is so commonly used that multiple accesses alone aren't enough for alarm.\n\nSixth event:\n- Process: calc.exe.\n- Winlog task: Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad).\n- File: C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll is a bit odd because Calculator typically doesn't load such modules. Urlmon is related to URL parsing and might be used for malicious purposes like downloading files or establishing connections. This could be a red flag, but I need more context.\n\nSeventh event:\n- Process: svchost.exe.\n- Winlog task: Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent).\n- No file info.\n\nSvchost is a common process that hosts various services, and it often modifies the registry. Alone, this isn't suspicious.\n\nEighth to tenth events:\n- Multiple instances of svchost modifying the registry. Again, not unusual unless combined with other activities.\n\nEleventh event:\n- Process: winlogbeat.exe.\n- Winlog task: File created (rule: FileCreate).\n- File path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new.\n\nWinlogbeat is likely an agent or tool used for log management. Creating a new config file isn't suspicious on its own, but the presence of such a tool could indicate monitoring setup—possibly by attackers for data exfiltration.\n\nTwelfth to fourteenth events:\n- Multiple powershell accesses and process creations.\n\nFifteenth event:\n- ApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying registry. Another legitimate Windows process with standard operations.\n\nSixteenth event:\n- Calculator.exe modifying the registry, similar to calc.exe earlier, which is unusual but not necessarily malicious without more context.\n\nSeventeenth to twentieth events:\n- Chrome.exe making DNS queries and network connections. Browsers typically do this, so nothing out of place here.\n\nNow, looking at all events together:\n\nI notice several instances where powershell.exe is accessed multiple times. Powershell is a common tool for both admins and attackers. The fact that it's accessed frequently might not be suspicious on its own unless it's being used in an unusual way or alongside other indicators.\n\nThe calc.exe loading urlmon.dll stands out. This isn't typical behavior for Calculator, which usually doesn't load such modules. It could suggest that calc.exe is being used as a vessel to execute malicious code, perhaps downloading something over the network via urlmon.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries of svchost.exe modifying registry values. While svchost itself is legitimate, attackers often abuse it by creating new services or modifying existing ones in the registry, leading to persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event could be part of log management but might also indicate that an attacker has deployed tools to monitor and potentially exfiltrate logs, which would be concerning.\n\nConsidering all these points, there are several red flags:\n\n1. calc.exe loading urlmon.dll: Unusual behavior.\n2. Multiple powershell accesses: Could be for legitimate admin tasks or malicious scripts.\n3. Registry modifications by various processes: Particularly when combined with other indicators, this could suggest malicious activity like persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nHowever, without more context on the timing and exact commands used in powershell, it's hard to definitively say these are malicious. Still, the combination of unusual calc.exe behavior and registry modifications is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple potential indicators that, while not conclusive on their own, together suggest possible malicious activity. The confidence isn't very high (maybe 60-70%) because some of these events could be legitimate admin tasks or false positives. But the anomalies, especially around calc.exe and urlmon.dll, are significant enough to merit closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"justification\": \"The batch contains multiple events that, while not conclusively malicious, present potential indicators of compromise. Notably, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll is unusual behavior, and repeated powershell accesses combined with registry modifications could suggest malicious activity.\",\n  \"confidence_score\": 65\n}\n```"}
