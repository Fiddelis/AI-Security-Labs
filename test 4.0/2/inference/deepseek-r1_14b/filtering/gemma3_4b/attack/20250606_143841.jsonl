Let's go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event is about powershell.exe accessing something. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers, so that's a red flag. Then there's whoami.exe being executed twice—this might just be normal user activity to check permissions or system info, so not too suspicious yet.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing different files and registry values. That makes me think maybe it's running scripts or trying to escalate privileges. The command line in one event shows a PowerShell script using New-PSDrive with a target like \"\\Target\\C$\". That looks fishy because it's attempting to access another drive, possibly as part of lateral movement.\n\nAlso, there are several file operations: creating and then deleting a .ps1 file quickly. This could be an attempt to execute malicious code temporarily, which is a common tactic to avoid detection. The files created in the Temp directory and then deleted might indicate that the attacker is cleaning up evidence.\n\nAdditionally, the events show powershell.exe loading various .dlls and interacting with system processes like Windows Defender. While some of these are normal for PowerShell scripts, others might be part of an attack chain, such as lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern here that suggests potential malicious activity. Multiple process creations, file operations, registry changes, and attempts to access other drives could indicate an attacker trying to move laterally within the network or execute malicious scripts. The repeated use of powershell.exe with these specific actions increases my concern.\n\nI'm also noticing that whoami.exe is run a couple of times without any obvious anomalies in its command line—so maybe it's just legitimate, but combined with the other events, it doesn't add much to the risk level beyond what's already there.\n\nOverall, the combination of powershell.exe activities, file manipulations, and registry changes points towards something that might warrant further investigation. So I'd classify this batch as interesting because it shows signs that could be part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing system resources, creating and deleting files quickly in the Temp directory, and attempting to access other drives.

Let's see what each event is about.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from powershell.exe accessing processes and registry changes. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The repeated ProcessAccess tasks could indicate someone exploring the system or trying to gain privileges.\n\nThere's a cmd.exe process that was created but with an empty command line. That might be suspicious, as sometimes adversaries use command-line tools minimally to avoid detection.\n\nI notice whoami.exe was run. This is typically used to get user information and could be part of reconnaissance activities.\n\nLooking at the file events: there are several FileCreate actions by powershell.exe, creating temporary files in AppData. The fact that one file was created and then immediately deleted (FileDeleteDetected) suggests an attempt to remove evidence or a failed script execution.\n\nThe ImageLoad tasks show various DLLs being loaded by PowerShell. This is normal for scripts but could also be part of malicious activities if the DLLs are unknown or suspicious.\n\nThere's a PipeCreated event, which might be used for inter-process communication. Malware sometimes uses pipes to hide their activity.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and registry, creating and deleting files in temp directories, using whoami.exe—these behaviors could indicate command-and-control activities or lateral movement within a network.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. So, all these events are from PowerShell processes. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement.\n\nLooking through the events, I see several instances where Registry values are being set. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts, so that's concerning. There are also multiple file creation and deletion events. The file created is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_gbsqa1tg.2k0.ps1, which seems like a temporary script file. Then it gets deleted shortly after, which might indicate an attempt to execute the script without leaving long traces.\n\nAnother point of interest are the ImageLoad events, which show PowerShell loading various .NET framework components and others. While this is normal for scripts, the combination with other actions could be suspicious. Additionally, there's a Pipe Created event, which can be used for communication between processes or to hide malicious activities.\n\nThe batch also includes a whoami.exe execution. That might just be reconnaissance, but when combined with PowerShell activity, it raises the possibility of an attacker checking user privileges or system information.\n\nPutting all these together—multiple registry changes, temporary file creation\/deletion, image loads, and process access—it seems like this could be part of malicious script execution or persistence setup. The confidence is high because several indicators align with common attack behaviors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple Registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, and the use of PowerShell, which are potential indicators of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is whoami.exe being executed. That seems normal because it's a standard command used to check user information. No red flags here.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Now, PowerShell can be legitimate but is often abused in attacks. The fact that it's accessed and created several times makes me cautious. I should look into the commands being run.\n\nOne of the events shows a command line with an if-else statement checking for procdump.exe. Procdump is a legitimate tool used for debugging, but attackers sometimes use it to dump process memory. The script exits if procdump exists; maybe trying to avoid detection or proceed only under certain conditions.\n\nAnother event mentions creating and then deleting a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_h1gpo202.5ec.ps1). This could be part of testing script execution policies, but it's suspicious because attackers might use such scripts to execute malicious code while evading detection by removing evidence afterward.\n\nLooking at the file operations, there are several file creations and deletions, which might indicate an attempt to create temporary files for malicious activities. The deletion after creation is a common tactic in attacks to clean up traces.\n\nRegistry modifications aren't directly shown here, but process access events could relate to privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe without legitimate context, combined with these file operations and the presence of potentially malicious scripts, raises concerns about possible attacker activity. However, it's also possible that this is part of a system's normal operation, especially in environments where PowerShell scripting is common.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because the combination of multiple PowerShell accesses, script creation\/deletion, and file operations could indicate malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and executed, along with suspicious file creation and deletion activities, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are related to PowerShell and cmd.exe being executed. For example, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is loading files, creating new files, accessing processes, and even creating processes. This could be normal administrative activity, but it's worth keeping an eye on because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities.\n\nThen, I see that whoami.exe was run a couple of times. That tool is typically used to determine the current user's identity, which might not be suspicious by itself unless it's part of a larger pattern indicating privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n\nThe cmd.exe entry caught my attention because it executed \"netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off\". This command turns off Windows Defender Firewall, which could be an indicator of malicious activity trying to disable security features. However, legitimate users might do this too if they're troubleshooting network issues, so context is important here.\n\nAnother red flag is the use of netsh.exe to again attempt turning off the firewall. Repeated attempts to modify firewall settings can be a sign of unauthorized access or an attempt to create persistence in malware.\n\nLooking at the svchost.exe entries, there are several registry-related tasks. SvcHost is a legitimate Windows process, but it's often used by malware to hide their activities because many services run under svchost.exe. The repeated registry modifications could be an attempt to install persistent backdoors or alter system configurations maliciously.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple PowerShell executions with various file and registry operations, disabling the firewall through cmd and netsh, whoami for user enumeration—all these behaviors collectively suggest potential malicious activity. They don't necessarily confirm it on their own, but the combination raises red flags that could indicate a breach or attack.\n\nI'm concerned about the number of events involving process creation and access, especially with tools like PowerShell and cmd being used in ways that might not be typical user behavior. The attempt to disable the firewall is concerning because it can leave the system more vulnerable, which is something attackers might do after gaining access.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if this could be a result of legitimate administrative tasks or system updates. But given the variety and frequency of these actions across multiple processes, it's leaning towards being suspicious. The confidence isn't 100%, but there are enough indicators to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creations and file\/registry operations involving potentially malicious activities such as disabling firewall, using PowerShell for unknown purposes, and svchost.exe registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine whether this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nEach line in the JSONL is an event with three fields: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always 'svchost.exe', which is a common system process that can be legitimate but sometimes used by malware. The winlog field indicates that there was activity related to adding or deleting registry objects, specifically under the RegistryEvent rule. The file field is None in all cases.\n\nI know that svchost.exe is often associated with services and can be involved in malicious activities if it's part of a known threat. But seeing multiple instances where the same process is performing registry modifications might not always be suspicious. However, the fact that there are 25 identical events could raise an eyebrow because repeated registry changes by svchost.exe might indicate some kind of pattern or script running.\n\nOn one hand, these could just be legitimate system updates or service configurations. On the other hand, attackers sometimes use such processes to create persistence mechanisms by modifying the registry. The high number of events suggests a possible loop or automated process altering the registry multiple times.\n\nI also consider that the file field being None might mean there's no associated file operation, which could point away from some types of attacks but not others. Since each event is isolated and only involves registry changes, it's hard to tell without more context. But the sheer number makes me lean towards it being interesting because repeated activity by svchost.exe in this manner isn't typical unless something is scripting it.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is malicious, but I think there's a reasonable chance that these events could indicate suspicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe making registry changes may indicate potential malicious activity or unusual system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. There are quite a few events here—let me count them quickly... It looks like around 20 events in total. \n\nLooking at the first several entries, I see that they all involve 'svchost.exe' and mention tasks related to RegistryEvent. Specifically, the task field says \"Registry object added or deleted\" for the first 17 logs. So these are events where svchost.exe is making changes to the Windows registry. Now, svchost.exe is a legitimate process that hosts various services in Windows, so it's not inherently malicious. But repeated registry modifications could be a red flag if they're unusual or happening at an unusual time.\n\nThen, around the 18th event, there's a change. The task becomes \"Registry value set,\" which is another type of registry activity—this time setting a specific value rather than adding\/removing objects. Still, within svchost.exe's normal operations, so maybe not too concerning yet.\n\nMoving on to the next group of events (from 19 onwards), I notice that the process command line now shows 'powershell.exe' with some arguments. The commands are: \n`{New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}`\n\nWait, let me parse this. Powershell's New-PSDrive cmdlet is used to create a new PowerShell drive. In this case, it's trying to map the G:\\ drive to a remote location on \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\". The use of \"\\Target\\C$\" suggests that they're attempting to connect to a remote machine named 'Target' and access its C drive.\n\nThe tasks associated with these events are \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle.\" These typically relate to PowerShell's own operations, such as starting up or initializing modules. But when combined with the command line arguments, it raises an eyebrow because using Powershell to connect to a remote machine could be part of legitimate administration but is also commonly used in malicious activities like remote access or lateral movement.\n\nSo putting this together: multiple svchost.exe processes making registry changes and then Powershell attempting to create a drive to a remote location. Could this be normal? Well, svchost.exe doing RegistryEvent tasks might be normal during system operations, especially if services are being started or stopped. However, the sheer number of these events—17 in a row—is a bit concerning because that's a lot of registry activity from the same process.\n\nAs for the Powershell part, connecting to another machine could be part of legitimate remote management but is often seen in attacks as a way to spread within a network or access data. The combination of multiple registry changes followed by remote PowerShell commands makes this batch interesting. It might indicate an ongoing attack where an attacker is setting up persistence mechanisms (registry modifications) and then attempting to move laterally to other machines.\n\nAnother point is that the Powershell command seems repeated several times, which might suggest automated or script-driven behavior—potentially malicious scripts trying multiple attempts or different commands.\n\nSo considering all these factors: svchost.exe making numerous registry changes and then Powershell attempting remote connections. While each individually could be legitimate, together they create a pattern that's more suspicious than not.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe performing RegistryEvent tasks followed by repeated Powershell commands attempting to connect to a remote machine suggest potential malicious activity such as lateral movement or persistence setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break down each part.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell executions. The command lines vary slightly but mostly involve `powershell.exe` with some script snippets. In the first event, there's an attempt to create a new drive using `New-PSDrive` targeting \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\". That stands out because it looks like an external or remote drive mount, which could indicate lateral movement in an attack.\n\nThen, I see multiple events where PowerShell is run with empty command lines. These might be part of legitimate processes, but the repetition raises a flag. Maybe they're testing if a file exists, as seen in later events where `Test-Path` checks for \"procdump.exe\". This suggests an attempt to verify the presence of specific files, possibly before downloading or executing them.\n\nLooking at the 'task' field in winlog, there are both 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks. The mix could indicate different stages of PowerShell execution, like starting up or providing services, which might not be suspicious on their own but combined with other activities could signal something more.\n\nI also note that all these events have \"file\":\"None\", meaning no file paths were captured. This makes it harder to trace where files are being accessed or written, which is concerning if malicious activity is suspected.\n\nPutting this together: the batch shows repeated PowerShell executions with varying scripts, some targeting remote drives and others checking for specific files. These behaviors could be part of reconnaissance, file exfiltration, or installing malware. The fact that they're spread across multiple events suggests a possible attack chain.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the combination of actions—using PowerShell with potentially malicious scripts, remote drive access, and repeated checks for files—points to possible malicious intent. However, without more context like timestamps or source IPs, it's hard to be certain, so my confidence is around 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell executions with potentially malicious commands, including attempts to access remote drives and file existence checks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, there are two identical JSON objects here, each representing a process event. The command line is \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell.exe\" with some additional code inside curly braces. The code checks if a specific file exists: \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..\\registro_secundario\\procdump.exe\". If it does, the script exits with 0; otherwise, it exits with 1.\n\nThe winlog field shows the task as 'Engine Lifecycle' for both events, and there's no file information provided. Since these are process creation events in Windows, they're pretty standard, but let me think deeper.\n\nI know that PowerShell is often used for legitimate administration tasks but can also be abused by attackers. The script here is checking for a specific executable. If an attacker uses such a script, it might be part of an attempt to check if certain tools are present on the system before deploying malicious ones. But in this case, since the events just show the check and no subsequent actions, they don't indicate any immediate harm.\n\nHowever, repeated checks like these could be signs of reconnaissance or persistence mechanisms. Maybe the attacker is trying to ensure that their tooling is present before proceeding with an attack. Alternatively, it could be a benign script checking for tools as part of system monitoring.\n\nI'm also considering whether this behavior aligns with normal user activity. A legitimate admin might run such checks, but the exact path structure (with ..\\registro_secundario) seems a bit convoluted. It's possible but not common. \n\nSince there are two identical events, it suggests that the same script was executed twice, which could be part of an automated process or multiple attempts to check the file's existence. This repetition might warrant closer look if seen in a real-world scenario.\n\nOn the other hand, without seeing any other related events like actual execution of procdump.exe or unusual network activity, it's hard to classify this as malicious. It could just be a script running checks for various reasons.\n\nSo, is this batch interesting? It does raise some flags but doesn't definitively indicate malicious behavior. The justification leans towards it being potentially suspicious but not conclusive. My confidence is moderate because while the activity isn't entirely normal, it's also possible to have legitimate reasons.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show a PowerShell script checking for the existence of procdump.exe, potentially indicating reconnaissance or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
