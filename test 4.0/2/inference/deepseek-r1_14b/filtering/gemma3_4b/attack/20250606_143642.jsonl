{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this batch of log events to see if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. So, I'm seeing multiple events related to powershell.exe being executed on the system. That's already a red flag because PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement.\n\nLooking closer, there are several ImageLoad events for various DLL files. Some of these paths seem legitimate, like clrjit.dll and mscoree.dll, which are standard parts of the .NET framework. However, I notice that some of these loads are happening from different locations, including Windows Defender Platform files. That's a bit concerning because attackers might try to mask their activities by using legitimate processes or libraries.\n\nAnother event stands out: powershell.exe was executed with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The command line includes a script that checks for specific .inf files in the Windows directory and looks for a particular pattern. This could be part of a malicious payload trying to gather information or perform some system changes based on certain conditions. Restricted execution policies usually restrict scripts, so this might be an attempt to bypass some security measures while still executing code.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event where powershell.exe creates a file in the Windows Temp directory with a somewhat unusual name containing \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\". This could indicate that the script is attempting to test or modify script execution policies, which is another common tactic used by attackers to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple PipeCreated and ProcessAccess events. Pipes are often used for interprocess communication, but in the context of PowerShell scripts, they can be a way to hide commands or exfiltrate data. The fact that these events are happening alongside other potentially suspicious activities adds to the concern.\n\nI also notice that whoami.exe was executed. While this is a common command to check user permissions, it's worth noting if it's part of a larger sequence of events that could be used for privilege escalation or information gathering.\n\nPutting all this together, while some of these actions are normal and don't necessarily indicate malicious activity on their own, the combination raises flags. The repeated use of PowerShell with specific execution policies, the creation of temporary files, and the checking of system files could all be part of a larger attack vector. It's possible that an attacker is using legitimate tools in a way that's unusual or attempting to execute arbitrary code.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that this is just normal script execution or system maintenance. Without more context, like timestamps or additional events showing异常 behavior, it's hard to be certain. But given the nature of the commands and the repeated use of powershell.exe with specific parameters, there's a reasonable suspicion that this batch might indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious PowerShell activities including execution with restricted policies, file creations in system directories, and attempts to access or load potentially malicious modules.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL events here.\n\nThe first event shows cmd.exe being executed with the command line that includes Dism and some parameters. The task is Process Create. Then there's a PowerShell process access event. Next, several events show Dism.exe creating files and detecting executables in specific paths under the user's temp directory.\n\nHmm, I know that Dism is a legitimate Windows tool used for managing system features. But seeing it being executed with commands to disable Defender and remove components sounds suspicious. Also, the fact that multiple DLLs are being created in a temporary folder might indicate something malicious, like files dropped by malware.\n\nThe repeated File Executable Detected events on these new files could mean that the system is flagging them as potential threats. This combination—using Dism to alter system features and creating numerous executables—isn't typical user behavior. It looks like it could be an attempt to disable security features or deploy malicious software.\n\nSo, putting this all together, there's a high chance of malicious activity here. The events are definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Dism.exe executing potentially suspicious commands and creating files in temporary directories, along with repeated file executable detections, suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line has three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nThe process is always Dism.exe. That rings a bell; Dism is usually related to Windows deployment services, like deploying or configuring Windows images. It's part of the operating system tools, so it's not inherently malicious.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, each one says \"File Executable Detected\" with the rule FileExecutableDetected. This sounds like a standard Windows event when an executable file is created or modified. It's a common event to track executables for security purposes but doesn't necessarily mean something bad happened—it could just be normal activity.\n\nThe file paths are all under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with various .mui extensions. These files seem to be localized resource files, often used by Windows and applications for language-specific resources. The filenames like DismProv.dll.mui and others ending in .mui suggest they're part of the system's localization packages.\n\nPutting it all together, each event is Dism.exe detecting an executable file in a temporary directory with standard naming conventions. Since these are just resource files being processed by a legitimate Windows tool during deployment or setup, there doesn't seem to be any indication of malicious activity here.\n\nI don't see any unusual patterns like repeated failed attempts, access from unauthorized locations, or deviations from normal Dism.exe operations. It's possible that the system is installing updates, performing some deployment tasks, or running scripts that involve these localized resources.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I'm leaning towards this batch being not interesting for investigation. The events are typical and don't raise any red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Dism.exe detecting standard executable files during normal system operations, likely related to Windows deployment or localization resources.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events here. All the JSON objects seem to be similar, each with a process named \"Dism.exe\", a winlog task indicating a file executable was detected, and a file path that's varying but within the same temporary directory.\n\nFirst off, Dism.exe is known as the Deployment Imaging Service and Management tool in Windows. It's used for managing image-based deployments. So it's a legitimate system process. But seeing multiple instances of it might raise some flags because it's not common to have so many file executions from this process at once.\n\nLooking at the files being detected, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\" followed by different DLLs like SysprepProvider.dll.mui and others. The fact that these are .dll files suggests they're dynamic link libraries, which could be legitimate or malicious depending on their source.\n\nThe temporary directory path is a red flag because it's a common location for malware to drop files since it's less likely to be monitored. Also, the naming of the files seems consistent but I'm not familiar with all these specific DLLs. Some might be standard, while others could be part of malicious activities.\n\nConsidering that each event is Dism.exe detecting a file executable, this could be normal if Dism is running as part of some legitimate process, like installing or configuring software. However, the sheer number and variety of files being executed by Dism.exe in a temporary folder might indicate something suspicious, such as an attacker using Dism to execute multiple malicious payloads.\n\nAnother angle is the frequency of these events. If this happened over a short period, it could suggest a concerted effort to deploy several components quickly, which isn't typical during normal operations. Additionally, the fact that all files are in the same temp directory and have similar naming conventions might point to a batch deployment mechanism, possibly used by malware for lateral movement or installing multiple components.\n\nI should also think about whether Dism.exe is known for executing many files at once. From what I know, it's more commonly used for imaging tasks rather than executing numerous DLLs. So this could be outside its usual behavior, which would make it suspicious.\n\nIn conclusion, while the individual events might not all be malicious, the combination of multiple executions by Dism.exe in a temp directory raises concerns about potential malware activity or unauthorized system changes.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process and File Types:**\n   - The process running is `Dism.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment imaging services.\n   - The detected files are DLLs, which can be either legitimate or malicious.\n\n2. **Analyze the Temporary Directory Usage:**\n   - All files are located in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`), a common location for both legitimate and malicious activities due to reduced monitoring.\n\n3. **Examine Frequency and Number of Events:**\n   - The occurrence of multiple file executions by `Dism.exe` within a short period is unusual, as such processes are typically not frequent in normal operations.\n\n4. **Assess File Names and Quantity:**\n   - The variety of DLLs (e.g., SysprepProvider.dll.mui, IntlProvider.dll) raises suspicion. While some might be legitimate, others could indicate malicious intent.\n\n5. **Consider Potential Malicious Activities:**\n   - The high number of files in a temp directory suggests possible malware deployment or unauthorized system changes.\n   - `Dism.exe` is not typically used to execute numerous DLLs; this behavior may signal misuse.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events likely indicates suspicious activity. While individual components might be legitimate, the combination of multiple file executions by `Dism.exe` in a temporary directory suggests potential malware or unauthorized system changes. Further investigation is recommended to confirm the nature of these files and processes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"incident\": {\n    \"description\": \"Multiple file executions detected by Dism.exe in a temporary directory, raising suspicion of malicious activity.\",\n    \"status\": \"Investigation Needed\",\n    \"recommendations\": [\n      \"Scan the identified DLLs for malware using antivirus software.\",\n      \"Review system logs for unusual patterns around these events.\",\n      \"Monitor the affected user account for any signs of compromise.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```"}

There are several JSON objects here, each representing an event on the system.\n\nFirst, I notice that many events involve 'Dism.exe' and various DLL files being detected as executables. Dism is commonly associated with Windows deployment services, so it's not unusual to see it running during setup or configuration processes. The repeated detection of these DLLs might just be part of a legitimate operation, like deploying an OS image or performing system updates.\n\nThen there are events involving 'DismHost.exe'. This process is also related to disk management and system deployment. It's starting up and loading several modules, which again seems consistent with standard operations rather than malicious activity.\n\nAll these files are located in the same temporary directory, which suggests they're part of a single, ongoing process. The naming conventions of the DLLs like 'SetupPlatformProvider.dll' and 'OSProvider.dll' align with known components used during system setup or repair.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access, encryption attempts, or other red flags typically associated with malware. The consistent use of Windows-related processes and files makes me think this is a legitimate activity, possibly related to system updates or deployment.\n\nSo overall, while it's important to monitor such activities, there doesn't seem to be anything malicious here. It looks like normal operations involving known Microsoft tools.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate processes related to Windows deployment and system management using Dism.exe and DismHost.exe, loading various provider DLLs for standard operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is DismHost.exe, and the Windows log task is Image loaded with various DLL files in the same temporary directory. This seems normal because DismHost.exe is part of the Windows Deployment Services, used for imaging and deployment tasks. Loading these DLLs is expected during its operation.\n\nThen, towards the end, there's an event where Dism.exe is deleting files like AppxProvider.dll from that same temp directory. Again, Dism.exe is another known tool related to image servicing. It’s common for it to delete temporary files after use.\n\nLooking at all these events together, they seem to be part of a normal Windows system process—specifically, the deployment or imaging tools creating and then cleaning up temporary DLLs. There's no indication of unusual activity, such as multiple failed attempts, access from unknown sources, or inconsistencies that might suggest tampering or malicious behavior.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized processes or unexpected file operations outside the scope of what DismHost.exe and Dism.exe typically do. The files being loaded and deleted are all standard components for these tools.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn’t raise any red flags. It’s more about routine system operations rather than anything malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal operations of DismHost.exe loading DLLs and subsequent deletion by Dism.exe, which are part of standard Windows deployment processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at multiple events here, each in JSONL format. Each event has three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nFirst, the process key shows that \"Dism.exe\" is running. Dism.exe stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool, which is a legitimate Windows utility used for servicing operating system images. So on its own, seeing Dism.exe shouldn't be suspicious because it's part of standard OS operations.\n\nNext, looking at the winlog key, each event mentions tasks like \"File Delete logged\" or \"File creation time changed\". The task names are from specific rules: FileDeleteDetected and FileCreateTime. These seem to be Windows security logs indicating that a file was deleted or its creation time was modified. These events could be part of normal system operations or might indicate something malicious.\n\nNow, the file paths all point to different DLLs and MUI files within a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder. The paths look like they're part of an installation or update process. For example, \"DismCorePS.dll\" and \"en-US\\AppxProvider.dll.mui\" are typical for language packs or system components being handled during servicing.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Dism.exe is deleting several files in a temporary directory. Since Dism.exe is a legitimate tool used for OS deployment and updates, this could be part of an update process cleaning up old files or installing new ones. The repeated deletion of multiple files might seem concerning at first glance, but considering the context, it's more likely related to system updates.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether these deletions are happening outside of normal operations. Since all events are from the same user and the same temporary directory, it doesn't immediately suggest a breach or unauthorized access. If there were other signs like unusual file origins or times, that might raise more flags, but here everything points to standard servicing activities.\n\nTherefore, while I'm cautious because file deletions can sometimes be part of malicious activity, in this case, the combination of process and files suggests it's related to legitimate system updates rather than a security threat. So, this batch isn't particularly concerning unless there are additional indicators pointing to compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch is not particularly concerning as it likely relates to legitimate system operations.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Process Identification:** The events involve \"Dism.exe,\" a legitimate Windows tool used for OS image servicing, indicating potential updates or installations.\n\n2. **File Operations:** Multiple files are being deleted in a temporary directory, which is typical during the cleanup phase of system updates or installations.\n\n3. **Log Type:** The tasks logged (File Delete and File Creation Time Changed) are standard actions captured by Windows security monitoring, not indicative of malicious activity without additional context.\n\n4. **File Paths:** The files are DLLs and MUIs within an AppData temporary directory, which aligns with components handled during system servicing or updates.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch represents normal system operations related to OS updates or servicing using Dism.exe. There's no evidence of malicious intent in the provided logs."}

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this log data and trying to figure out what's going on. It seems like a lot of process creation and file activity, especially from PowerShell. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where PowerShell is being created or accessed. The command line for one of them is \"& {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}\". That looks like a script trying to delete files in the Temp directory. Maybe someone is trying to clean up traces of something else.\n\nThen, there are several ImageLoad events from PowerShell loading different DLLs. This is normal when scripts run because they use .NET and other libraries, but it's worth noting which ones are being loaded. For example, System.Management.Automation.ni.dll is expected, but the MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender seems out of place. Could that be a red flag?\n\nLooking at file operations, there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1. Then it's deleted shortly after. This might be part of PowerShell's script policy testing, but the naming looks suspicious, especially with \"entrada_principal\" which I think is Spanish for \"main entry.\" That could indicate some malware trying to execute a payload.\n\nOther processes like services.exe and svchost.exe modifying registry values aren't unusual, but they should be monitored. Malware sometimes uses these legitimate processes to hide its activities. Also, the whoami.exe process running might just be checking permissions, but it's something to keep an eye on.\n\nThe timestamps show activity happening in quick succession, which could indicate automated scripts or malicious behavior trying to stay under the radar. The repeated file creation and deletion of the PowerShell script is concerning because it might be part of an attempt to execute code without being detected for long.\n\nI should also consider the user context. If this activity is from a regular user account, it's more suspicious than from a system process. Plus, the use of \"fiddelis\" in the file path doesn't ring any bells as a standard username, which adds to the oddness.\n\nIn summary, while some activities are normal for a system with PowerShell scripts running, the combination of deleting files, creating and then immediately deleting script files, and using potentially suspicious command lines points towards possible malicious activity. It would be wise to run additional checks, like looking for more deleted files or recent changes in system settings, to confirm if this is an attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log data indicates potential malicious activity on the system, particularly involving PowerShell processes and file operations. Here's a concise summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Malicious Script Execution**: The command line \"& {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}\" suggests an attempt to delete files named \"*entrada_principal.zip\" in the Temp directory, possibly to remove traces of malicious activities.\n\n2. **Suspicious File Operations**:\n   - A PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1) is created and immediately deleted. This behavior could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving a trace.\n   - The filename \"entrada_principal\" translates to \"main entry\" in Spanish, which might be part of a payload execution.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Processes like services.exe and svchost.exe are modifying the registry, which is common for both legitimate software and malware aiming to maintain persistence.\n\n4. **DLL Loadings**: PowerShell loads several DLLs, including MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which might indicate an attempt to disguise malicious activities under legitimate processes.\n\n5. **Process Activity**: The repeated creation and deletion of processes (e.g., powershell.exe, whoami.exe) could be part of a script meant to evade detection or perform unauthorized actions.\n\n6. **User Context**: The username \"fiddelis\" is not standard, which adds to the suspicion, though it's possible it's a legitimate user account with unusual naming.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n- Conduct a thorough system scan for any hidden files or processes.\n- Review recent file and registry changes to detect unauthorized modifications.\n- Monitor network activity for signs of data exfiltration or communication with external servers.\n- Consider isolating the affected system and performing a clean installation if malicious activities are confirmed.\n\nThis analysis suggests that the system may have been compromised, and immediate action is needed to mitigate risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events from a cybersecurity perspective. The user provided several JSONL entries, each representing an event on the system. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that almost all the events are related to PowerShell.exe. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for executing malicious commands due to its built-in capabilities and widespread presence on Windows systems. However, it's also commonly used by admins for legitimate tasks, so context is key here.\n\nLooking at the details:\n\n1. Some events show that PowerShell is accessing system files like `clrjit.dll` and `MpClient.dll`. These are standard .NET framework components and part of Windows Defender, respectively. Accessing these might not be suspicious on their own but could indicate script execution.\n\n2. There's a file creation event in the user's AppData folder: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`. This is unusual because it's creating a custom directory, which could be part of a persistence mechanism or data exfiltration.\n\n3. Registry activity is present where a value is being set. This could be for creating a registry-based persistence point to ensure the script runs on subsequent reboots, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\n4. Multiple events show process access and provider\/engine lifecycle events, suggesting that PowerShell is starting up or tearing down components. The repeated occurrence of these tasks might indicate an automated process running multiple times or a script looping through actions.\n\n5. The command lines are varied but often involve `Write-Host` statements, which output messages to the console. However, one of the commands is more complex: it's checking for specific patterns in .inf files under the Windows directory. This could be attempting to detect installed drivers or components, possibly looking for indicators of other software or vulnerabilities.\n\n6. The fact that the same command lines are repeated multiple times might indicate an automated script being run several times, which could be a sign of testing or probing behavior.\n\n7. Despite the restricted execution policy (`-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`), some commands are still executing, which means they're likely using signed scripts or taking advantage of other bypass techniques. However, in this case, it's unclear if those checks were actually successful.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell activity that includes file creation, registry modifications, and script execution. While some actions aren't inherently malicious, the combination—especially the repeated attempts to check .inf files and create a custom directory—raises concerns about potential malicious intent. Additionally, the persistence mechanisms (registry writes) and repeated process access could be signs of an active infection trying to maintain presence on the system.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it exhibits several red flags indicative of possible malicious activity, even though individual actions might not be suspicious on their own. The cumulative effect across all events suggests a need for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation, registry modifications, and repeated script execution with potential persistence mechanisms indicate possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the initial events have a process command line that looks suspicious. It's using powershell.exe with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted, which is a bit unusual because usually scripts run without such restrictions unless they're trying to do something sneaky. The command seems to be searching through .inf files in the Windows directory and checking if they contain specific patterns related to installation sections. That could indicate someone is looking for driver or system component information, maybe trying to identify vulnerabilities or components that can be exploited.\n\nThen there are a bunch of events where powershell.exe is being used with a command to remove specific files from the Temp directory. The exact file being removed is *entrada_principal.zip. This looks like an attempt to delete potentially malicious files or evidence of previous activities. The fact that it's using Remove-Item in PowerShell could mean they're trying to clean up traces.\n\nLooking at the event types, some are under 'Provider Lifecycle' and others under 'Engine Lifecycle'. I'm not entirely sure what each task corresponds to, but the repeated occurrence suggests a pattern rather than isolated events. The combination of searching for certain files and then deleting specific ones could be part of a larger script or routine, possibly malicious.\n\nI also notice that multiple events have the same command lines, which might indicate automated execution, perhaps from a script running multiple times or different processes invoking the same commands. This repetition is a red flag because it suggests either persistence (like in a botnet) or testing certain attack vectors repeatedly.\n\nThe confidence level here is pretty high because the activities involve using PowerShell with restricted policies and deleting specific files that might be malicious. While some of these actions could be legitimate, the combination and frequency make me lean towards them being suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe commands show file deletion attempts in Temp directory and searching for specific .inf files, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
