{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about DiscordSetup.exe being created with a command line that points to the download location. That makes sense because when you install software, you usually run an installer like DiscordSetup.exe. So this seems normal.\n\nNext, there are events where the image loads DiscordSetup.exe, followed by creating files under SquirrelTemp for Update.exe. SquirrelTemp is something I've heard about related to squirrel-based package managers, maybe for updates? So it's possible that Discord is checking for updates or something similar.\n\nThen, Update.exe gets created and runs with a command line that includes --install. That also sounds like part of an update process. It loads some .NET framework DLLs, which is normal for executables running in Windows. There are multiple ImageLoad events from Update.exe pointing to different system libraries, which again seems standard.\n\nThere's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a configuration file, which makes sense if it's part of the log collection process. Then, Update.exe creates files related to Discord's app directory, which is probably during installation or update.\n\nThe next several events are all ProcessAccess tasks from Update.exe accessing itself. I'm not entirely sure what these mean, but they might be part of some internal checks or processes that don't indicate anything malicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together, the events look like a normal update process for Discord. The setup runs, creates temporary files, installs updates, and logs activity. There's no indication of any unusual behavior or signs of malware, such as unexpected file creations in system directories or strange network connections. All the processes are related to expected activities during an application update.\n\nTherefore, while I can see that there's a lot happening with Update.exe accessing itself multiple times, without more context indicating malicious intent, these events seem normal. So the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because nothing stands out as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show a standard update process for Discord, including setup execution and file creation related to updates.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two events where Update.exe is being accessed and created. That might be part of the normal update process for the app, so it doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, several events show Discord.exe creating pipes and accessing processes. These activities look typical for a running application, especially one like Discord that uses background processes and might communicate with other services or crash handlers. The command lines mention squirrel install and crashpad handler, which are standard mechanisms for updates and crash reporting in Electron-based apps.\n\nI notice multiple ImageLoad events for Discord.exe and ffmpeg.dll. Again, this is normal since these files are essential for the app's functionality, handling audio and video processing.\n\nThe ProcessCreate event for Update.exe with a specific command line about creating a shortcut also seems routine—it’s probably part of setting up the application or its launcher on the system.\n\nLooking at all events together, there's no indication of unusual access patterns, missing files, or signs of tampering. The activities align with Discord's expected behavior during launch and operation.\n\nI don't see any red flags like unexpected file accesses, network connections to suspicious domains, or process injection attempts.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is an update.exe loading clrjit.dll. That seems normal because it's part of the .NET framework. No red flags here.\n\nNext are multiple Discord.exe processes being created and accessing other processes or files. The command lines look like standard Discord startup parameters, including various options for GPU processes and network services. Nothing unusual in the arguments; they're typical for a Discord instance.\n\nI notice several events where Discord loads DLLs like ffmpeg.dll, which is expected since Discord uses such libraries for media processing. Also, Pipe Created events are common in inter-process communication, so that's nothing to worry about.\n\nThere are two FileCreate tasks by Update.exe, creating shortcuts in the Start Menu. This seems like an installation or setup process, maybe when Discord was installed or updated. The creation of a .lnk file is standard for shortcut files, so no issue there.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, all these events are happening within a short period. This could indicate a normal startup or update sequence rather than malicious activity spread out over time.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual file accesses, network connections, or other behaviors that would raise suspicion.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm looking at a batch of events from a system log. The goal is to determine if the entire batch should be classified as interesting or not based on potential malicious behavior.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve \"Update.exe\" accessing processes and creating files. Specifically, there are multiple instances where Update.exe accesses processes and creates links related to Discord. For example, one event shows Update.exe creating a file at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Desktop\\Discord.lnk\", which is a shortcut on the desktop pointing to Discord. Another event has it creating a shortcut in the Start Menu.\n\nI know that legitimate software updates might create shortcuts or access certain files during installation or updates, but I'm concerned because these actions are repeated multiple times and involve creating shortcuts for a Discord application. While Discord itself is a standard app, malicious actors sometimes use familiar tools to hide their activities.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where \"Discord.exe\" loads some DLLs which seems normal since Discord is a graphics-intensive application that relies on various libraries. However, I should consider if these DLLs are being loaded from unexpected locations or in unusual ways, but the paths provided look standard.\n\nThe fact that both Update.exe and Discord.exe are involved makes me think about potential file injection or unauthorized modifications. Maybe Update.exe is part of a legitimate update process for Discord, but it's possible it could be deploying malicious components if the source isn't trusted.\n\nI'm also considering whether these events indicate persistence mechanisms. Creating shortcuts in various locations like the desktop and Start Menu might be ways to ensure that the application runs on startup or during user sessions, which is common for both legitimate and malicious software.\n\nAnother point is the frequency of the events. There are numerous instances where Update.exe accesses processes without any associated file changes, which could just be normal operation, but the combination with file creation events raises a red flag. It's possible that this activity is part of a legitimate update process, but it's also worth investigating to rule out malware.\n\nI'm thinking about whether these actions align with known attack vectors or indicators of compromise. For example, creating multiple shortcuts in various locations might be a way for malware to ensure persistence across reboots. Alternatively, if Update.exe isn't actually part of Discord's legitimate update process, it could be a dropper for malicious software.\n\nGiven that I don't have more context about the source of these events or the system's environment, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because the repeated file creation and process access by an executable named Update.exe (which is generic and often used maliciously) alongside Discord-related activity could indicate potential nefarious intent. The confidence level isn't too high since it could be a false positive if Update.exe is indeed legitimate, but there's enough concerning behavior to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'Update.exe' creating Discord-related shortcuts and accessing processes suggest potential malicious activity or unauthorized system modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm new to analyzing logs, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about processes accessing or creating things. For example, there's a lot of \"Process accessed\" and \"Pipe Created\" tasks. The same goes for files and registry changes. I wonder if these activities are normal or suspicious.\n\nLooking at the process names, I see \"Update.exe\", \"Discord.exe\", and \"reg.exe\". Discord is a known application, so some of its activity might be expected. Reg.exe is used to edit the Windows Registry, which could be part of installing or updating software.\n\nI notice several instances where reg.exe is being used with commands like adding registry keys under HKCU\\Software... It looks like they're setting up Discord's run entry and modifying class associations. That seems a bit unusual because typically, you wouldn't expect an application to modify the registry in that way unless it's installing something.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Pipe Created events for Discord.exe. I'm not sure what those pipes are for. Maybe they're used for inter-process communication? But having so many might be a red flag or just normal depending on the application.\n\nThe file created event is for a .lnk file in the user's desktop pointing to Discord, which seems like a shortcut creation. That's probably normal if someone was setting up their environment.\n\nHowever, considering all these events together, especially multiple registry edits and process creations\/terminations, it feels like something might be off. It could be part of a legitimate update or installation, but the frequency of these events across different processes makes me think there's more to it.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is malicious, but it definitely stands out as abnormal enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple registry modifications and pipe creations by Discord.exe, which may indicate unusual behavior or potential tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events. Let me try to make sense of them. The logs are all related to Discord and another process called Update.exe. \n\nFirst, there's a lot of activity involving reg.exe, which is usually used for registry operations. The command lines in the logs show that reg.exe is being used to modify the Windows Registry under HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Classes\\\\Discord. Specifically, it's setting default icons and shell commands. This might be Discord trying to set up its integration into the system or add entries so it can be opened from file associations.\n\nThen, there are several instances where Discord.exe creates pipes. Creating multiple named pipes could indicate some form of inter-process communication, which is normal for applications, but in some cases, it might also be a technique used by malware to establish hidden communication channels.\n\nLooking at the process create and terminate events, I see that Discord is starting up, then Update.exe is involved in creating a shortcut on the Start Menu. The ImageLoad events show Discord loading various DLLs, which is standard for an application's operation.\n\nHowever, the use of reg.exe modifying the registry to set default icons and shell commands might be suspicious because it could be an attempt to gain persistence or modify system behavior in ways that are common in malicious activities. While Discord is a legitimate application, such changes might not be typical during its normal operation unless it's part of its update process.\n\nThe repetition of these events—like multiple pipe creations and process accesses—doesn't immediately raise red flags but could indicate some automated setup or updates. The fact that the same commands are being executed multiple times might suggest a loop or repeated attempts, which could be concerning if they're outside normal operations.\n\nConsidering all this together, it's not clear-cut whether these events are malicious. They could be part of Discord's legitimate update process or something else. However, the combination of registry modifications and repeated process creations\/terminations, along with pipe creations, does warrant closer examination to ensure there's no underlying malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple Discord.exe processes accessing system resources and modifying the Windows Registry via reg.exe.

Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nMost of the logs are from \"Update.exe\" accessing processes and files, but a few are from Discord-related processes. The first thing that stands out is that there are multiple entries where Update.exe accesses something via ProcessAccess. I know that repeated process access could be normal for updates or system checks, but it's also possible that an attacker might use the same process name repeatedly to hide malicious activity.\n\nThere's one event where Update.exe created a file at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Desktop\\Discord.lnk\". A .lnk file is a Windows shortcut, which could be used for malicious purposes if it points to something harmful. So creating this file might indicate some suspicious activity.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that Update.exe is setting registry values and then terminating the process. Legitimate software often modifies the registry, but combined with other actions, this could raise flags. Also, the termination of processes can sometimes be part of a cleanup routine by malware to cover its tracks.\n\nLooking at Discord-related logs: There's a DNS query, creation of pipes, loading images like ffmpeg.dll. Those seem normal for Discord running, especially since it's an Electron-based app that might need to load various components. The command line parameters look standard too, with options like crashpad-handler and annotations about the product version.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned because all these events are from the same user \"fiddelis\". If there's a lot of activity concentrated on one user account, especially if it's an admin account, that could be risky. Malware often operates under such accounts to gain higher privileges.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple process creations, file operations, and registry modifications by Update.exe, plus Discord-related activities. While some parts might be normal, the combination of many ProcessAccess events, creation of a shortcut, and registry changes could indicate potential malicious behavior. The high number of similar events from one process (Update.exe) adds to the suspicion.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these actions are benign, especially since there's a created shortcut file. But I also don't have enough context about whether Update.exe is a legitimate process on this system. If it's unexpected or running outside its usual environment, that could be concerning.\n\nSo my classification would be INTERESTING because while some parts might not look suspicious on their own, the overall pattern raises questions that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple process access events from Update.exe and a file creation of a .lnk shortcut.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of JSONL events to analyze as a cybersecurity expert. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING,\" along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's a process creation event for Discord.exe. The command line looks pretty standard, launching the Discord application with various parameters like GPU type, user data directory, and some disabled features. This seems normal because when you start an application, especially one as resource-intensive as Discord, these flags are typical.\n\nThe next few events are variations of process access and image load events for the same Discord.exe. These seem routine too; applications often log such events when they're accessed or when images (like DLLs) are loaded into memory. The paths mentioned, like app-1.0.9190 with specific files like ffmpeg.dll and updater.node, are all standard parts of Discord's operation.\n\nI notice that there are two separate process creation events for Discord.exe—one as a GPU process and another as a utility network service. This makes sense because Discord uses multiple processes to handle different functionalities, such as graphics rendering or networking. The command lines have similar disabled features but different types, which aligns with how Discord structures its processes.\n\nAll the events are under the same user (fiddelis) and occur in the same directory structure. There's no indication of unusual paths or external executables being loaded. No network connections or file writes\/reads outside the expected locations are present in these logs. The lack of any anomalies like unexpected process spawns, missing files, or signs of tampering is significant.\n\nConsidering that Discord is a well-known application with a large user base, its legitimate processes would generate such log entries frequently. Without seeing deviations from the norm—like unusual command-line arguments, access to restricted areas, or failed operations—the events here don't raise red flags.\n\nI also think about whether these logs could be part of an attack vector. For example, sometimes malware uses legitimate processes like Discord.exe as a parent process for its own execution. However, in this case, all the processes are direct and expected without any signs of child processes or unusual behavior that would indicate malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is the timestamps of the events. If they're sequential and within a short period, it suggests a normal startup sequence rather than spread out over time, which might be suspicious if occurring under different circumstances.\n\nIn summary, each event in the batch appears to be part of Discord's standard operation. There are no signs of unauthorized access, unusual activities, or deviations from expected behavior. Therefore, this batch isn't particularly interesting from a cybersecurity investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events describe normal process creation and image loading by Discord.exe with standard parameters and file accesses.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of events from \"Discord.exe\". The first event is a file creation of a .lnk file on the desktop. Then there are multiple entries where Discord accesses processes and creates pipes. These could be normal operations since Discord might need to access various system resources. \n\nLooking further, there's an entry for \"reg.exe\" being used to modify the registry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord, setting a value to \"URL:Discord Protocol\". This seems like it's setting up a protocol handler in the registry, which is standard when an application wants to handle URLs or integrate with the system's URL handling. Discord might do this to enable its own protocol for links, like opening specific Discord servers or channels directly from the browser.\n\nI'm checking if any of these actions are out of the ordinary. The repeated \"Process accessed\" and \"Pipe Created\" events don't raise red flags since they're common in applications that need inter-process communication. The file creations are also normal when an application sets up shortcuts or registers itself in the system.\n\nThe registry modification by reg.exe is a bit more concerning, but since it's part of Discord's setup, it's likely legitimate unless there's evidence of malicious intent elsewhere. There's no indication here that any unauthorized access or privilege escalation has occurred.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they seem to be part of Discord's normal installation and operation processes. Without additional signs of suspicious activity like unusual file accesses, network connections, or failed process creations, I don't see enough evidence to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be related to Discord's normal operation and registry setup, with no signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst off, most of the events are related to Discord.exe. The initial event shows Discord starting with a bunch of command-line arguments. That seems normal because Discord is a complex application that might have many parameters when it runs. I've seen similar processes before where apps need specific flags for rendering, security schemes, and other configurations.\n\nThen there's an event where reg.exe is used to add a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord with the key \"URL Protocol\". That caught my attention because modifying the registry can be a sign of malicious activity. However, I remember that legitimate applications sometimes do this to register themselves as protocol handlers (like how Discord handles .discord links). So I need to check if this is part of Discord's normal setup.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where pipes are created by Discord.exe. I know that named pipes can be used for inter-process communication. Again, this could be normal, especially in applications that use plugins or have separate components communicating with each other.\n\nAnother event has reg.exe modifying the DefaultIcon value for Discord. This is setting the icon path and index. It's common for apps to set their own icons in the registry when they register themselves, so this doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nI should also consider the overall pattern here. There are multiple instances of Process Create, Image Load, Process Access, and Pipe Creation events all tied to Discord.exe. The fact that these events occur sequentially makes me think it's part of the normal startup process for Discord.\n\nIs there anything unusual? The command-line arguments in the first event include flags like --no-sandbox and --no-zygote, which are common in Chromium-based apps to improve performance and compatibility. So that doesn't raise a red flag.\n\nI also don't see any signs of failed operations or errors. If this were an attack, I might expect some events indicating access denied or failures, but everything seems to complete successfully here.\n\nSo putting it all together: the logs show Discord.exe starting up, accessing necessary resources, creating communication pipes, and registering itself in the registry. All these actions are standard for a legitimate application like Discord. There's no evidence of unusual behavior or indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal startup activities of Discord.exe, including process creation, image loading, registry modifications, and pipe creations, which are typical for a legitimate application.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL events related to Discord's activity on a system.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving reg.exe. The first event shows reg.exe being used to add a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. That seems a bit suspicious because modifying the registry can be a common tactic for malware or unauthorized software to maintain persistence or alter system behavior. I should keep an eye on that.\n\nThen, looking at Discord.exe's activities, there are several network connection detections. Network connections are pretty common, especially for applications like Discord that need to communicate over the internet. But multiple detections might indicate some unusual activity, like a botnet or command-and-control communication. However, since Discord is a legitimate application that requires frequent network access, this could just be normal traffic.\n\nThere's also a DNS query event. Again, this isn't uncommon for applications needing to resolve domains, but sometimes attackers use DNS for tunneling or C2. I'll need to assess if the queried domains are legitimate or if there's something fishy about them. However, without specific domain names in the logs, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother point is the file operations. Discord.exe is loading ffmpeg.dll and another DLL from a temporary directory. While Discord does use third-party libraries like FFmpeg for media handling, having files in temp directories might raise flags if those files aren't expected or if they're being executed unexpectedly.\n\nI'm also noticing multiple Process Create events and RegistryEvent changes. These can be part of normal operations, but when combined with other indicators like network activity and file modifications, it could signal something more malicious.\n\nOn the positive side, there's no evidence of actual exploitation or data exfiltration in these logs. The activities are all within what a legitimate Discord process might do, especially since there are events related to unzipper utilities and service sandbox types, which align with Discord's functionality.\n\nHowever, the initial use of reg.exe to modify the registry is concerning because it could be used for persistence or privilege escalation. Malware often uses registry modifications to ensure it starts up on boot. So that single event stands out as potentially malicious.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, while most activities are benign and part of Discord's normal operation, the use of reg.exe to modify the registry raises a red flag. This combination makes the batch interesting from a security perspective because it could indicate unauthorized system changes or potential malware activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious activities such as registry modifications and multiple network connections, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that most of them are from \"Discord.exe\". That's the Discord client, which is pretty common for users communicating online. Now, what do these events show?\n\nThe first seven events all have a task called \"Network connection detected (rule: NetworkConnect)\". That makes sense because Discord often needs to connect to servers for voice chat, messages, etc. So seeing multiple network connections isn't unusual.\n\nThen there's an event where the task is \"Process terminated (rule: ProcessTerminate)\". This could be normal if Discord is closing a process after use or shutting down. No immediate red flags here.\n\nNext, there's an event with \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Applications often interact with the Windows registry to store settings and preferences. So this activity isn't inherently suspicious either unless it's modifying sensitive areas or doing so in a way that's inconsistent with normal behavior.\n\nLooking at all these events together, I don't see any signs of malicious behavior. They seem consistent with Discord's expected operations—connecting to networks, terminating processes when done, and updating registry settings. There's no indication of unusual access patterns, multiple failed attempts, or other red flags like writes to unexpected files or privilege escalations.\n\nSince all the events are within the bounds of what a legitimate application like Discord would do, I don't see any reason to classify this batch as interesting for investigation. It might be helpful to correlate with other logs if there's a specific incident being investigated, but on their own, these don't raise concerns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal Discord operations, including network connections and registry updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
