Now, looking at the file paths, they're all located in a directory that includes \"node_modules\", which is typical for JavaScript projects, especially where tools like Cypress and lodash are involved. These files seem to be TypeScript definition files (.d.ts), which makes sense as part of a project's type definitions.\n\nI'm trying to think if creating multiple files at once could indicate something malicious. Git is commonly used in development, so it's normal for it to create or update files during cloning, pulling, or other operations. The fact that many .d.ts files are being created might just be part of the project setup or a build process.\n\nI don't see any unusual patterns here.

The output should be a single classification: either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nLooking at the logs, each line represents an event where the process name is \"git.exe\". The task in the winlog field says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the file paths all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\" followed by different .d.ts files. \n\nSo, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events are file creation events triggered by git.exe. The paths point to TypeScript definition files in a node_modules directory under cypress. This suggests that these are part of a project using Node.js and the Cypress testing framework, as they're located within the node_modules folder which is typical for npm packages.\n\nThe user account associated with this activity seems to be \"fiddelis\", based on the path C:\\Users\\fiddelis... So, it's likely that fiddelis is a developer working on the S206 - Qualidade de Software project. The file names like identical.d.ts, identity.d.ts, etc., are all part of the lodash library's type definitions for functional programming utilities.\n\nNow, I should consider whether these events are indicative of malicious behavior or something normal. Since git.exe is a standard tool used for version control, and creating files in node_modules during development is expected when installing dependencies or when npm packages are being updated, this seems like legitimate activity.\n\nIs there any red flag here? Let me think about possible signs of maliciousness. One thing that comes to mind is whether the file paths look suspicious or if they're executing unusual commands. But these are just file creation events in a typical development environment. There's no indication of privilege escalation, encryption activities, known malware signatures, or other indicators of compromise (IoCs) like process injection,registry modifications, or network communications.\n\nAnother angle is to consider the volume of events. There are 14 such events in this batch, each creating a different .d.ts file under lodash's fp directory. While it's possible that something malicious could generate multiple log entries, the context here aligns with a developer environment where multiple files might be created or updated as part of building or installing dependencies.\n\nI should also think about whether git.exe is being used in an unusual way. Git can execute arbitrary commands via hooks or through certain configurations, but in this case, it's straightforwardly creating files, which is standard during repository cloning or syncing.\n\nIs there any chance that these could be logs from a script or build process? Definitely. Many CI\/CD pipelines and development environments log file creation events when dependencies are installed or code is built.\n\nIn summary, the activities described in the logs appear to be normal and expected behavior within a software development context. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, malicious payload execution, or other suspicious indicators. The consistent use of git.exe and the paths involved strongly suggest that this is part of the standard build and dependency management process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal file creation activities by git.exe during development, specifically within a Node.js project's node_modules directory.

There's no indication that these file creations are part of a larger suspicious pattern. The consistent naming and structure of the files align with what you'd expect from a legitimate software development environment.\n\nThe fact that each event is just a file create action without any other associated activities (like network calls, permission changes, or deletions) makes me more confident that this isn't something to investigate further. It's pretty standard for development tools to create these types of files during setup or updates.\n\nAlso, considering the user context—C:\\Users\\fiddelis—it seems like a personal account being used for development purposes, which is another point in favor of normal activity.\n\nIn summary, while each event on its own could be monitored, when viewed as a whole batch, they collectively represent routine actions during software development.

The node_modules folder can get pretty big with all sorts of packages and their type definitions.

So, I'm given a batch of JSONL events where each event is a file creation by git.exe in specific paths under the node_modules folder related to Cypress and lodash. My task is to analyze all these events together to determine if they're interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst off, let's understand what each event represents. Each JSON object indicates that a file was created by git.exe. The file paths are all within the \"node_modules\" directory, which I recognize as a standard folder in Node.js projects where third-party modules are stored. Specifically, these files are under \"cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\", which suggests they're part of Cypress's type definitions for lodash functions.\n\nNow, considering that git.exe is typically used for version control operations like cloning repositories, checking out code, or syncing changes. When you clone a repository, especially one that includes Node.js projects, it's common to have files under node_modules because npm (Node Package Manager) automatically installs dependencies there. So, the creation of these files could just be part of the normal setup process when someone sets up a project using Cypress and lodash.\n\nLooking at all the events together, I notice they're creating multiple .d.ts files—these are TypeScript declaration files that define types for modules without including implementation details. Having several such files created in quick succession makes sense if a developer is initializing or restoring dependencies. Tools like npm install would trigger file creations in node_modules as part of their installation process.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual activity here. There's no indication that these files are being deleted, accessed abnormally, or coming from unexpected sources. The consistent naming and structure of the paths reinforce the idea that this is normal behavior during development setup.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider if there's any other context that could make this suspicious. For instance, if git.exe was used in an unusual way, like overwriting files or accessing restricted areas, but here it's just creating standard files in a typical location. Also, the frequency of these events—14 in total—isn't particularly high; it's within what you'd expect when setting up a project with multiple dependencies.\n\nIn summary, while each individual file creation isn't alarming, looking at the batch together shows a pattern consistent with normal development activities. There's no evidence of malicious intent or indicators of compromise present in these events.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to standard file creation operations during the setup of a Node.js project, specifically under node_modules which is typical for npm installations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The winlog task says it's a file creation event triggered by the rule FileCreate. The file paths are all under the same directory but different files within the node_modules of cypress\/types\/lodash.\n\nSo, each line represents a new file being created by git.exe in that specific path. It looks like someone is installing or updating dependencies related to Cypress and Lodash. These files are part of type definitions for TypeScript, which is common when using tools like npm or yarn.\n\nSince all the events are similar and involve legitimate file operations during development setup, there's no sign of malicious activity here.

Each event is a JSON object, and they all seem to follow the same structure. Let me try to break down what each part means.\n\nFirst off, every event has three main components: process, winlog, and file. The \"process\" field shows that the name is \"git.exe\". That's interesting because git is commonly used for version control in software development. So, it's likely related to some sort of build or deployment activity.\n\nNext, the \"winlog\" part indicates the task as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means that a file was created on the system, and this action triggered an event. The rule being referenced here is about tracking file creation events, which makes sense for monitoring purposes.\n\nLooking at the \"file\" field, each entry has a specific path. They all point to files within a folder structure: C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\. The filenames vary but they end with .d.ts, which I know is TypeScript declaration file format. These are typically used for type definitions in JavaScript and TypeScript projects.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like the git.exe process is creating multiple files related to Cypress types in a node_modules directory. Node_modules usually contains third-party libraries used in Node.js applications, so this could be part of a project setup or build process. The fact that they're all under cypress\/types\/lodash suggests they might be type definitions for the Lodash library, which is commonly used for utility functions.\n\nNow, considering whether these events are interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Since all events are file creations by git.exe in a node_modules folder, this doesn't immediately raise any red flags. It looks like standard behavior during development or build processes where files are being generated or copied as part of package installation or updates.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no indication that these files were created by unauthorized processes or from unknown sources. The paths are typical for a software project setup, and the process involved is git.exe, which is a legitimate tool.\n\nHowever, I should consider if repeated file creations in this manner could be part of an unusual pattern. But given that node_modules can change during deployments or updates, it's not uncommon to see multiple files being created at once. There's no evidence here of deletions, modifications, or other actions that would suggest tampering.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm pretty sure these are benign events. The consistent process name and predictable file paths reinforce this assessment. Unless there's additional context indicating that git.exe is acting abnormally in the system, which isn't present here, these logs don't warrant further investigation from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show file creations by git.exe in a typical node_modules directory during development or build processes, indicating normal activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

There's no indication of any unusual behavior or signs of malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events here. Each line is a JSON object with some system log information. All of them have the same structure: they mention \"git.exe\" as the process name, the task is \"File created\", and the file paths are all under a user's Downloads directory in a folder named after a course called \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". The files being created are various .d.ts files inside the node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash directory.\n\nFirst off, I need to determine if this batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break down what each part means. \n\n\"git.exe\" is a common tool used for version control. It's widely used in software development environments. The fact that it's creating files doesn't immediately raise red flags because git operations often involve file creation or modification as part of the normal workflow, like cloning repositories, updating code, or installing dependencies.\n\nLooking at the task description: \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This just indicates that a new file was made. It's a standard event in system logs and usually not suspicious on its own unless there are other factors indicating it shouldn't be happening, like unexpected locations or unusual patterns of creation.\n\nThe file paths all point to types\/lodash files within the node_modules directory. Node.js modules are common in web development projects. Cypress is a testing framework for JavaScript applications, and lodash is a utility library that's frequently used with JavaScript\/TypeScript projects. So these files being created under this structure seem typical of someone working on a software project using these tools.\n\nNow, considering the user context: the username is \"fiddelis\", which doesn't ring any bells as a known malicious actor or botnet name. The path includes a course named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\", which translates to something like \"S206 - Software Quality\" in Portuguese. This suggests that the user might be working on academic software projects, possibly in an educational environment where they're learning about software quality and testing—hence using tools like Cypress.\n\nLooking at all these events together, they seem consistent with a developer's routine activities. Multiple .d.ts files being created under the cypress\/types\/lodash directory likely relate to TypeScript type definitions for Lodash utilities, which would be part of setting up or updating the project's dependencies.\n\nI should also consider if there's any unusual volume here. There are 14 events in a row, each creating a different .d.ts file under the same parent directory. While it might seem like a lot at once, it could still make sense if this is part of an automated process during development setup or after updating dependencies.\n\nAnother angle to think about: Could \"git.exe\" be behaving abnormally? Git itself isn't malicious, but sometimes attackers use legitimate tools for malicious purposes. However, in this case, the events are straightforward file creations without any signs of exfiltration, deletion, or access patterns that would indicate something suspicious.\n\nThe timestamps aren't provided, so I can't tell how much time passed between these events. If they all occurred within a very short period, it might raise an eyebrow, but without that data, it's safer to assume normalcy unless there are other red flags.\n\nAdditionally, the file paths don't point to any sensitive areas beyond typical project directories. There's no indication of files being created in system folders or anywhere outside the user's own projects.\n\nIn summary, each event appears benign on its own, and together they present a consistent picture of a developer working with their tools and projects. Without evidence of anomalies like access to unauthorized resources, unusual file operations, or signs of lateral movement, there's no reason to classify this batch as interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by a user working with git and Node.js tools in a development environment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me start by understanding what each field means.\n\nLooking at the first few entries:\n\n- The \"process\" field shows that the name is \"git.exe\". So whatever action is happening is related to Git, which I know is a version control system used for software development.\n- The \"winlog\" field indicates that it's a file creation event, specifically under the task \"File created\" with a rule named \"FileCreate\". This means that each of these events represents the creation of a new file.\n- The \"file\" path is something like \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\...\", so it's pointing to various .d.ts files in a node_modules directory, specifically within the cypress and lodash folders.\n\nHmm, I'm noticing that all these events are occurring under the same process (git.exe) and they're all creating files. The file paths are all in a node_modules folder, which is typical for JavaScript\/Node.js projects because node_modules contains all the packages or dependencies used by the project.\n\nWait, but why would Git be involved in creating these files? Well, when you work with Node.js projects, especially using tools like npm or yarn to manage dependencies, sometimes Git can track changes in those modules. It's possible that during a development workflow, files are being added or modified within node_modules. However, modifying node_modules directly isn't common because it's usually managed via package.json and the package manager.\n\nBut looking closer at these events, they're all about file creation. So each event is a new file being created by Git? That seems odd because Git typically doesn't create files; it tracks changes to existing files. Creating files would be more in line with a build process or perhaps some script that generates code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is during the setup of a project where these files are being generated as part of installing dependencies. For example, if someone runs npm install, it downloads and extracts modules into node_modules, which might involve creating new directories and files. In such a case, Git might log file creation events as it starts tracking those new files.\n\nAnother angle: could this be related to malicious activity? If an attacker is trying to create files on the system, they might do so using legitimate tools like Git to hide their tracks. But in this case, all the files are under node_modules and are part of a Cypress or Lodash setup, which are standard libraries. So it's more likely benign.\n\nI also notice that each file path is different but follows a similar pattern. It's not one repeated file being accessed, but multiple specific .d.ts files—TypeScript declaration files—which are common in Node.js projects to provide type information for JavaScript code.\n\nConsidering all these points: the same process (git.exe), consistent task (File created), and all within a node_modules directory.

Since all events are consistent with normal development activity, there's a high probability (0.9) that this batch isn't interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creation by git.exe under the node_modules directory, which is typical during development or dependency installations and does not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of log events. Each event is in JSONL format, so one JSON object per line. Looking at the first line, it shows a process named \"git.exe\" creating files. The file paths all start with \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\\" followed by different filenames like \"valuesIn.d.ts\", \"without.d.ts\", etc.\n\nHmm, so it's multiple events of the same type—file creation by git.exe. Git is commonly used for version control, and node_modules is a standard directory in Node.js projects. Cypress is a testing tool, and lodash is a library often used in JavaScript projects. The files being created are TypeScript definition files (d.ts), which makes sense if someone is setting up or updating their development environment.\n\nSince all these events are related to the same user's development activities, it doesn't seem unusual. There's no indication of any unauthorized access or malicious activity here. It looks like normal file operations during a project setup or update.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by git.exe in a development environment, indicating routine project setup or updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
