Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nThe first event is CompatTelRunner.exe loading AMSI.DLL. I know that AMSI is related to antivirus scanning, so maybe that's just normal behavior. The second event also involves CompatTelRunner.exe but this time it's loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which sounds legitimate too.\n\nThen there are several entries with \"Special Logon\" and \"User Account Management.\" I remember these can be related to user login events or group policy changes, which are pretty common and not necessarily suspicious on their own.\n\nNext, setup.exe creates a pipe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, so unless it's an unusual process like setup.exe doing something unexpected, this might not be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the events: powershell.exe is being run with ExecutionPolicy Restricted and some commands involving reading .inf files to check for specific patterns. That catches my attention because PowerShell is commonly used in attacks, especially with execution policies set to bypass restrictions. The script is looking for certain sections in INF files, which could be part of a malicious payload trying to determine if it's running on a target system.\n\nThere's also an event where svchost.exe is started with parameters related to BthAvctpSvc, which sounds like a legitimate Windows service process. However, sometimes malware can hide under svchost.exe, so I should keep that in mind but not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nAnother event involves chrome.exe modifying the registry, which seems normal as browsers often interact with the registry for settings and extensions.\n\nThe CompatTelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll is another process monitoring thing, probably related to task scheduling, so again, likely benign.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating a file in its Download folder is part of standard update processes, so that's nothing unusual.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe events are from Windows Defender. They're loading various DLLs and creating temp files, which is expected behavior for antivirus operations. However, the fact that there are multiple instances and specific file creations might be worth looking into if they seem out of place.\n\nConhost.exe interacting with the registryâ€”conhost is often used by command-line tools or scripts, so unless it's doing something unexpected, this might not be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The powershell.exe event stands out because it's using a restricted execution policy and checking specific files that could indicate reconnaissance or payload delivery. While other events are normal, the presence of potentially malicious PowerShell usage raises concerns about an attack in progress or planning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes events indicating potential malicious activity, such as powershell.exe execution with a restricted policy and file creation by MpCmdRun.exe. These could indicate an attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I see a bunch of JSONL events here. Each line seems to represent an event with some process information, Windows log task details, and file paths.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a process named MpCmdRun.exe, which is related to Windows Defender. The Windows log task mentions \"Image loaded,\" so that means Defender loaded a module. That's normal since antivirus software does this regularly for scanning and protection. Nothing too suspicious here.\n\nThen, most of the other events are from git.exe creating files in a directory: C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\semver\\. This looks like someone is working with Node.js modules, specifically semver which is used for versioning. All these file creation events under node_modules are typical during development or when installing dependencies. Git is commonly used for version control, so this activity aligns with normal software development workflows.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. The processes involved are standard ones for a system with antivirus running and a user engaged in coding or development. There's no indication of unusual file accesses, process creations from unknown sources, or other red flags that might suggest an attack or unauthorized activity.\n\nSo considering the entire batch, everything seems benign. It's just regular system operations and software development activities without any anomalies.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes including antivirus loading and file creation during software development.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a set of JSONL events to analyze as a cybersecurity expert. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at each event, they all share similar structures: the process name is \"git.exe\", and the Windows log task is \"File created\" with specific file paths. The files being created are located in various directories under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\". These include node_modules folders, which suggests they're related to a Node.js project setup or module installations.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that all these events involve the creation of files by git.exe. Since git is commonly used for version control, it's plausible that this activity is part of cloning a repository or installing dependencies during development. The paths under node_modules point to different packages like semver, serialize-javascript, set-blocking, and set-function-length. These are all standard Node.js modules, so their installation via npm (which often uses git for fetching) would create these files.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no indication of unusual file creation locations, access to sensitive files, or other red flags like multiple failed attempts or writes to unexpected directories. The consistent process name and task type suggest routine operations rather than suspicious behavior.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, I'm pretty sure this isn't an attack. All activities are typical for a developer setting up or working on a project that uses Node.js modules. There's no deviation from normal patterns, so there's little reason to suspect foul play.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show routine file creation by git.exe during what appears to be normal development activities involving Node.js modules.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

They all come from the same process named \"git.exe\" and each event indicates that a file was created. The paths are all within a node_modules directory, which is typical for npm packages in Node.js projects.\n\nEach line shows git.exe creating files like package.json, licenses, and various .js files under node_modules. This looks normal because when you clone or install dependencies using Git, it's common to see these files being created as part of the repository setup.\n\nThere's nothing unusual here. No signs of permissions changes, network activity, or unexpected file creation in restricted areas. All events are confined to a user's Downloads folder and relate to software development tools. So, I wouldn't flag this batch for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities related to Node.js modules during Git operations, which is expected behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's see what these logs are showing.\n\nLooking at each JSON object, the process name is \"git.exe\" every time. The task under winlog is consistently a file creation event (FileCreate rule). The files being created are all within the node_modules directory of a user's download folder. Paths like \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\\" and various subdirectories within that.\n\nHmm, so git.exe is typically used for version control with Git repositories. When someone clones a repository or installs node modules, git might create these files as part of the process. Node modules are standard in JavaScript development, especially if the user is working on a project that involves npm packages. The presence of files like package.json, readme.md, license, and .d.ts files all align with typical node module structures.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no indication of unusual file names, execution outside expected directories, or any other red flags associated with malware or suspicious processes. All the events are straightforward file creations during what seems like a legitimate software development process.\n\nSo considering all these factors, the batch doesn't indicate anything out of the ordinary. The activities described are normal for someone using Git and Node.js in their workflow.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activity by git.exe during a development process, specifically related to node_modules directories which are standard in JavaScript projects.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

So, I see that all these events are from the same process, git.exe. Each event indicates a file creation under different paths in a node_modules directory.\n\nFirst off, the user's path shows they're working on a folder named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\", which sounds like a course or project related to software quality. The files being created are typical for npm packagesâ€”things like index.js, package.json, README.md, etc. This makes me think that someone is installing or updating Node.js packages.\n\nNow, why would these events be suspicious? Well, git.exe creating files in node_modules could indicate that it's part of a development workflow, which isn't unusual. The paths look standard for a Node project structure. There's no indication of any file deletion, access anomalies, or attempts to execute code outside the expected behavior.\n\nI'm also considering if there's any pattern here that might suggest malicious activity. For example, multiple writes in a short time frame could be suspicious, but without timestamps, it's hard to say. However, given the nature of the files and the fact that they're part of node_modules, which is common after npm install or similar commands, this doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events seem to be normal file creation activities during software development. There's no evidence of anything malicious here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show the creation of standard Node.js package files by git.exe, which is typical during development or installation processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of 14 JSONL events. Each event is about a file creation by the git.exe process in a specific directory path. The files being created are all within the \"node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\" folder, which suggests they're part of a Node.js project's dependencies.\n\nI know that when running commands like 'npm install' or working with Git repositories, it's common for many files to be created or modified, especially in node_modules. Since each event is just a file creation and the process is git.exe, this could be during a clone, fetch, or sync operation. There's nothing unusual here because these activities are normal in software development environments.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior like access to sensitive files, unusual processes, or repeated failed attempts. All events are straightforward file creations from a known process in a typical project directory.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch doesn't indicate any suspicious activity. It's likely just part of the normal development workflow.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creations by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is a common and expected behavior during software development activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

That looks like it's part of a Node.js project because of the node_modules directory.\n\nSecond event: Same process name git.exe, same task File created, path is similar but ends with isTypeName.js. So another file being created in the same location.\n\nThird event again git.exe creating a file at isUnion.js under the same directory.\n\nSo all three events are related to files being created by Git, and they're within a Node.js module called tcomb. The paths seem normal for such modules. Since it's just file creation during development or build processes, this doesn't raise any red flags. No signs of unauthorized access, unusual locations, or multiple failed attempts that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nI think there's nothing suspicious here.
