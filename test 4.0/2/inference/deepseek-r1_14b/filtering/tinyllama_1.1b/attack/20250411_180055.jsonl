Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is a process access for powershell.exe. That in itself isn't unusual because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But on its own, it might not be enough.\n\nLooking at the second event, there's a Process Create task with a command line that uses Compress-Archive. This script seems to be compressing files from various paths into zip files in the TEMP directory. The destination path is using $env:TEMP, which dynamically points to the user's temp folder. Using dynamic variables can be a red flag because it allows for more flexible and less traceable operations.\n\nNext, there are multiple Image Load events showing that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs. While this is normal for PowerShell scripts, the combination of these with other activities might raise suspicion.\n\nThen I see File Delete logged events where specific .ps1 files in the user's temp directory are being deleted. Deleting script files could be an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after executing malicious code, which is a common tactic in attacks to avoid detection.\n\nThere are several Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events with command lines again using powershell.exe and Compress-Archive. The varied paths being compressed across different modules like tarefa_logico, modulo_principal, etc., suggest some level of automation or multiple script executions. This could indicate an attempt to compress different files from various locations, possibly exfiltrating data or preparing for a larger attack.\n\nA Pipe Created event is noted, which isn't uncommon but can be used for communication between processes. If this pipe is part of a larger chain, it might be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThe last two events show Registry value sets by both powershell.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. While RuntimeBroker is legitimate, the combination with PowerShell's registry changes could indicate attempts to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together, these events suggest a sequence where PowerShell is being used to execute scripts that compress files from different directories into temporary zip files, delete script remnants, and interact with both file and registry operations. Such behavior can be indicative of malicious activities like data exfiltration, lateral movement, or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe repeated use of Compress-Archive and the dynamic temp paths are concerning because they're often used in attacks to package information for transmission outside the network. The deletion of .ps1 files could be an attempt to cover tracks by removing script evidence that might have been executed maliciously.\n\nWhile some events on their own aren't alarming, the combination of these activities across multiple events makes the batch interesting from a security perspective. It's possible this could be part of normal admin tasks, but given the nature and frequency, it leans more towards potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes executing Compress-Archive commands on various paths, combined with file deletions and registry modifications, suggest potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration or system configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting enough for investigation or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. The first one involves ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal since many applications interact with the registry. Next up is powershell.exe accessing something. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to note but not immediately suspicious.\n\nMoving on, there are multiple events from chrome.exe. A few of them set registry values, which again could be part of normal operation since Chrome might tweak settings or extensions. There are also instances where Chrome loads certain DLLs, like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those sound familiar; amsi is related to antivirus scanning, so that's probably benign.\n\nThen there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems straightforward as it's likely part of log shipping or monitoring tools.\n\nI'm noticing that some events have no file path associated with them, which isn't unusual depending on the context. However, I should check if any of these actions are outside the norm for typical user activity. For instance, multiple registry writes from Chrome could indicate extension installations or updates, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nI also need to consider the combination of all events. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks by Chrome and powershell.exe might be worth looking into. While each individual event isn't alarming, the volume could suggest something like a script running multiple commands or perhaps a configuration change happening in batches.\n\nAnother point is that the events don't show any signs of failed attempts, which are often indicators of malicious activity. They all seem to have completed successfully. Also, no file creations or deletions beyond what's expected from monitoring tools and browser operations are present.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm on the fence because while there are some red flags like PowerShell access and multiple registry writes, there's nothing overtly malicious. It could just be regular system activity, especially if this is from a user with admin rights or someone running scripts for legitimate purposes.\n\nBut wait, why is powershell.exe appearing twice? That might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with the other events, it adds to the overall picture. Maybe it's part of an automated script that's setting up configurations or deploying tools, which could be either legitimate or part of a larger attack chain.\n\nI should also think about the source of these logs. If this is from a system where such activities are common, like a development environment, they might not mean much. However, in a more restricted environment, these events could raise flags.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are elements that catch my attention, the lack of clear malicious indicators and the possibility of normal operations make me lean towards classifying this as NOT INTERESTING. But I'm not entirely sure, so my confidence is moderate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activity with no clear signs of malicious behavior. Processes like chrome.exe and powershell.exe performing typical tasks without anomalies.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
