{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple events where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that reference various script paths like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name sounds suspicious because keystroke loggers are often malicious tools used for espionage. The fact that it's invoked multiple times across different file paths suggests possible persistence mechanisms or multiple attempts to run the same payload.\n\nLooking at the tasks, there are several FileCreate and FileDelete events involving temporary files in the user's Temp directory. For example, creating a PowerShell script policy test file and then deleting it shortly after might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or test if scripts can execute without being detected.\n\nThe process accesses include registry modifications, which is common for malware trying to maintain persistence by adding entries that allow them to restart on system boot. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks in Chrome also stand out; while Chrome can make such changes normally, the frequency here might indicate something amiss, especially if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad events involving different DLLs, including Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. Malware often tries to load legitimate libraries to avoid detection or blend in with normal processes. The fact that these are loaded by PowerShell instances adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe EngineLifecycle and ProviderLifecycle tasks suggest that some components are being started or stopped, which could be part of a broader malicious activity trying to hide or alter system behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions with potentially malicious scripts, file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, registry modifications, and attempts to load legitimate-looking DLLs creates a concerning pattern. These activities are indicative of possible unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or installation of malware. The repetition and variety of events point towards a coordinated attack rather than normal system operations.\n\nI'm confident that this batch is indeed interesting for investigation because it exhibits several red flags commonly associated with malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts related to keystroke logging, file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, and registry modifications indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst event: The process is powershell.exe executing a script from \"C:\\tarefa_base\\entrada_ativo\\entrada_temporario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" and logging keystrokes to key.log in the TEMP directory. That script name, Get-Keystrokes, sounds suspicious because it's commonly used for keylogging, which is malicious activity.\n\nSecond event: There's an Execute a Remote Command task, and the file path points to the same Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script. This suggests that the command was executed remotely, which could be part of an attack vector like remote execution or lateral movement in a network.\n\nThird event: winlogbeat.exe created a new config file. That's normal because winlogbeat is legitimate software used for log management. No red flags here.\n\nFourth event: powershell.exe creates a file named pacote_temporario.txt. Powershell is often used maliciously, but creating a temporary file isn't inherently suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern. Given the previous events, this could be part of the attack chain.\n\nFifth event: svchost.exe creates a file in the DeliveryOptimization folder. SvcHost is a common process for services, and sometimes malicious actors use it. However, the filename keyValueLKG.dat doesn't immediately raise flags, but combined with other events, it might indicate persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together: The first two events are the most concerning. The execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 via powershell.exe and the remote command execution suggest possible malicious activity like keylogging or unauthorized access. While some events could be benign, the combination points to potential attack behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activities including a PowerShell script named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is often used for keylogging, and remote command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
