{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from powershell.exe, which is a common tool used both legitimately and maliciously. The tasks include things like Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad), File created (rule: FileCreate), and Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess). There are multiple instances where files are being deleted or created in temporary directories, like C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. For example, there's a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_0wo2rwkr.dxh.ps1 being deleted. Temporary files can be a red flag if they're part of malicious scripts.\n\nLooking deeper, I see that one event has the command line: \"powershell.exe\" & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}. This seems to be creating a new PowerShell drive mapped to a remote target's C:\\ drive. Using such commands can indicate attempts to access or manipulate files on another system, which could be malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there are repeated file loads from the Windows Defender Platform directory, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. While these might be legitimate, their loading in conjunction with powershell.exe could be suspicious if they're part of a larger script or payload.\n\nConsidering all these points together—multiple file operations, deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts, and remote drive mapping—it's likely that this batch shows potentially malicious activity. The combination suggests an attack vector using PowerShell for persistence or lateral movement.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe with file deletions, creations in temporary directories, and a command line showing remote drive mapping suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the entries involve PowerShell activities. Specifically, there are multiple instances where `powershell.exe` is executed with a command line argument. These arguments look suspicious because they're using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` which suggests that they're trying to execute code downloaded from the internet.\n\nLooking closer, the URLs point to GitHub repositories and seem to be fetching scripts from known malicious sources like 'WinPwn.ps1'. This script is often associated with persistence mechanisms and can indicate signs of a potential infection or unauthorized access. The fact that this command is repeated multiple times across different events is concerning—it could mean that an attacker is trying multiple ways to execute this script.\n\nThere are also entries where the task in `winlog` is 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which might be related to PowerShell initializing or terminating drives, possibly indicating some form of remote access or lateral movement within a network. Additionally, there are logs showing execution of remote commands without any associated file activity, which could mean that an attacker is using command-line tools to execute code directly on the system.\n\nThe initial event shows a file creation in 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local...', which might be setting up a persistence point or storing some configuration. However, subsequent events either have no process or show more PowerShell commands without any file operations, suggesting that maybe the malicious activity is moving away from file-based actions to in-memory execution.\n\nThe repetition of similar command lines across multiple entries indicates automated attempts or scripts trying to establish persistence or spread within a network. This pattern isn't typical for regular user activities and raises flags about potential threats like malware or unauthorized access.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of downloading malicious scripts via PowerShell, repeated attempts to execute them, and remote command executions without legitimate justification suggests that this batch is highly indicative of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing suspicious commands from known malicious sources (GitHub repository S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WInPwn), repeated attempts to download and execute scripts, potential indicators of unauthorized access or malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
