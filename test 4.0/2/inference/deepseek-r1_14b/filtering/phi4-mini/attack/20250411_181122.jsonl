{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of events. So, I'm given a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event from system logs. My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to spot any patterns or anomalies.\n\nThe first event involves 'whoami.exe' being executed. That's pretty standard; whoami is a common tool used by users and scripts to check system information. Nothing suspicious here on the surface, but it's worth keeping in mind as context for later events.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessed. PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool often used by admins, but it can also be abused by attackers. The event types include 'Process Create', 'Registry value set', and various file operations like creation and deletion.\n\nLooking closer at the command line arguments for one of the process creations, there's this:\n`powershell.exe & {findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls | select-string -Pattern password}`\nThis catches my eye. The command uses findstr to search for files with extensions like .xml, .doc, etc., and then filters results containing 'pass' or 'password'. This looks like a common technique attackers use to search for sensitive information, such as passwords stored in text files.\n\nMoreover, there's a file being created and then immediately deleted:\n- Created: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1`\n- Deleted: Same path just after creation.\nThis temporary file is likely part of the script execution. The quick create and delete might be an attempt to avoid detection by leaving minimal traces.\n\nAdditionally, there are several 'Provider Lifecycle' events for the same command line. This repetition could indicate a loop or multiple attempts to execute the same malicious script.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- Unusual PowerShell activity with specific commands targeting password searches.\n- Temporary file creation\/deletion suggesting evasion tactics.\n- Repetitive process creations and registry modifications, which might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nI recall that such patterns are often associated with credential harvesting or exfiltration attempts. The combination of searching for sensitive terms across various files and the use of a script to do so is red flags for malicious activity.\n\nTherefore, this batch shows signs of potential malicious behavior. While individual events like whoami.exe aren't concerning, the overall pattern points towards something worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands with patterns indicative of credential harvesting and suspicious file operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That seems normal since it's likely the log shipping agent doing its job.\n\nNext, notepad.exe setting a registry value. Notpad is a common app, but writing to the registry could be suspicious, though sometimes legitimate.\n\nThen there are multiple powershell.exe entries. Powershell is often used by attackers because of its scripting capabilities. The command line in one event has \"findstr\" looking for \"pass\" in various file types—this looks like a password harvesting script, which is definitely concerning.\n\nLooking further, svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a legitimate process but can be abused by malware, so multiple events might raise flags.\n\nThere's also an OfficeClickToRun.exe making a DNS query. That seems okay unless it's part of some C2 communication, but without more context, I'm not sure.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe entries setting registry values—this could indicate malicious activity if done repeatedly or inappropriately, but sometimes legitimate too.\n\nThe process create event for findstr.exe is also notable since it's often used in scripts to search files, which could be part of data exfiltration or credential theft.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated powershell and svchost activities with suspicious command lines are red flags. The use of findstr searching for passwords across various file types is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, multiple registry writes by different processes might suggest persistence mechanisms. Overall, this batch shows signs of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious command lines searching for sensitive information and activities indicative of lateral movement or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's see what we have here.\n\nLooking at the logs, most of them are from Chrome.exe performing various tasks like DNS queries, registry changes, image loading, and network connections. These activities are pretty normal for a web browser, especially when it's handling multiple tabs or extensions. I don't immediately see any red flags here since Chrome is known to interact with these system resources regularly.\n\nThere are also some events from winlogbeat.exe related to file creation. Winlogbeat is likely the agent used to collect and send logs, so its activity is expected. The paths mentioned seem legitimate for a tool being downloaded and set up, nothing malicious jumps out here.\n\nThen there are a couple of entries involving powershell.exe. PowerShell can be both a useful admin tool and potentially dangerous if misused. However, looking at the tasks: creating files, accessing processes, and setting registry values. These actions aren't inherently suspicious on their own unless they're part of a larger pattern. The files created have names like 'objeto_logico.txt' and 'estrutura_ativo.txt', which don't seem to indicate anything malicious. \n\nOne event stands out: the execution of whoami.exe, which is often used to determine user identity or privileges. But in this context, it's just a process creation without any unusual command-line arguments or access patterns.\n\nConsidering all events together, while there are multiple processes and some potentially sensitive actions like registry edits and network connections, none of these individually or collectively suggest malicious behavior. They align more with normal system operations and the activities of monitoring tools. There's no evidence of privilege escalation, file deletions, unusual network traffic to known bad IPs, or other indicators of compromise.\n\nSo, after reviewing all the events, I don't see enough signs that would require further investigation. The batch doesn't indicate any suspicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The log entries consist of normal activities such as browser operations, file creations by monitoring tools, and legitimate PowerShell commands without indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the user has provided a batch of system log events in JSONL format and is asking for an analysis to determine if this batch is relevant for investigation. The output should be a single JSON result with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nStarting with the first event: It's a process creation of cmd.exe with a command line that deletes two scheduled tasks using schtasks. That seems suspicious because deleting scheduled tasks can be part of malicious activities to remove traces or disable system functions.\n\nThe second event is powershell.exe being accessed, which is often used for scripting and can be abused for attacks. The third event is another cmd.exe process setting a registry value, possibly modifying system settings.\n\nNext, there's schtasks.exe creating a process to delete another scheduled task. This repetition of deleting tasks is concerning as it might indicate an attempt to remove multiple malicious or unauthorized tasks.\n\nLooking further, svchost.exe accessing the registry stands out because svchost is a common system process but can be hijacked by malware. The events where whoami.exe is run and powershell.exe accessing the registry also raise flags. Using whoami can help gather user information, which might be part of an attack.\n\nThere are multiple instances of cmd.exe and wmic.exe processes trying to delete notepad.exe. This could be an attempt to remove any running instance of Notepad, possibly because it's being used as a decoy or to prevent logging. It's unusual for legitimate software to delete other processes, especially in such a repetitive manner.\n\nThe events involving WMIC.exe loading various DLLs might be part of malicious activities, as WMIC can execute commands remotely and is often targeted by attackers. The repeated registry modifications also suggest persistent changes to the system configuration, which could be signs of malware installation or modification.\n\nPutting all these together, the batch shows a sequence of process creations, registry modifications, and deletion of tasks and processes. These actions don't seem normal for regular user activity; instead, they resemble steps taken by an attacker during an intrusion. The repeated use of tools like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and WMIC.exe with suspicious command lines further supports the idea that this batch is indicative of malicious behavior.\n\nI'm pretty confident in this assessment because each individual event seems innocent but when viewed as a whole, they form a pattern consistent with cyberattack tactics—like lateral movement, process manipulation, and persistence mechanisms. The confidence level is high because multiple red flags are present across different processes and activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including repeated deletions of scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe, registry modifications, and process creations involving potentially malicious tools like cmd.exe and powershell.exe. These actions may indicate potential malicious behavior or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system logs. The goal is to determine if the entire collection is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nLooking at each event, I notice a significant number of process creations and accesses involving common tools like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, net.exe, and others. These are standard utilities often used in legitimate activities, but they can also be red flags when misused.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the repetitive execution of these tools, especially with command-line arguments that suggest deletion of user accounts. For example, there are multiple instances where 'net user \/del' is executed, which could indicate an attempt to remove user accounts from the system. This kind of activity can be malicious, such as in a credential stuffing attack or trying to erase traces of previous activities.\n\nAdditionally, the use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with command-line arguments that redirect output to 'nul' suggests efforts to suppress console output, which is a common tactic to avoid detection. Powershell is particularly concerning because it's often used for executing scripts and can be a vector for malicious activity like downloading files or running commands.\n\nThe events also involve registry value modifications. Since the Windows Registry is sensitive and often targeted by malware to maintain persistence, these changes could indicate an attempt to hide processes or alter system configurations in a way that's difficult to detect without thorough analysis.\n\nAnother point of concern is the pattern of repeated process creations and accesses. While legitimate scripts might run multiple commands, such a high frequency with varied but related malicious-looking actions raises suspicion. It seems like there's a coordinated effort to perform several operations that together could be part of a larger attack strategy, such as credential theft, persistence mechanisms, or system compromise.\n\nTaking into account the combination of all these events, the potential for malicious activity is significant. The tools used are common but their specific command-line arguments and repeated execution patterns suggest they might be part of an attack chain. Therefore, this batch of logs merits further investigation to determine if these activities are indeed malicious or part of legitimate system administration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creations and accesses involving potentially malicious commands like user deletion and output suppression indicate possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst event is cmd.exe running a command to delete win32times service. That's a bit concerning because deleting services can be part of malicious activities, like removing traces of malware or disrupting system functions. But I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nNext, there's powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and attacks, so this alone isn't suspicious unless combined with other actions.\n\nAnother cmd.exe event sets a registry value. Registry modifications can be part of normal operations but also often seen in malware persistence mechanisms. I'll note that.\n\nThen sc.exe deleting the same win32times service again. Repeating the deletion might indicate someone trying to hide or remove something from the system, which is more concerning.\n\nServices.exe modifying the registry multiple times. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, so its activity might not be suspicious on its own unless it's making unusual changes. I'll keep an eye out for patterns here.\n\nConhost.exe and whoami.exe are next. Conhost is used by PowerShell for console output, so that's more expected if PowerShell is running. Whoami.exe is a common tool to check user information, so unless it's run in an unexpected context, it might not be an issue.\n\nI see multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed or modifying the registry. This repetition could indicate script execution, which is often used by attackers for persistence or to execute malicious commands.\n\nOne cmd.exe event deletes a file in the Temp directory. Deleting files can be part of cleanup after malicious activity. The specific path mentioned seems tailored, so it's worth looking into whether this file was created by legitimate processes or something else.\n\nLastly, several events show powershell.exe with an empty command line and Provider\/Engine Lifecycle tasks. This might indicate that PowerShell is being used without executing any commands, which could be part of a larger script or malicious activity trying to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple cmd and powershell executions, repeated deletions of the same service, registry modifications, and file deletions in Temp. These activities collectively suggest potential malicious behavior aimed at persistence, data exfiltration, or system disruption. While each event on its own might not be alarming, their combination raises red flags for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creation and registry modifications involving cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and services.exe suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. So first, let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few events involve powershell.exe being created and accessed, which is common because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But just seeing it run isn't enough to raise a red flag unless there's something suspicious about the commands or behaviors.\n\nI notice that there are multiple instances where powershell.exe accesses registry values and loads images. That could be normal script execution, but sometimes attackers use these actions to hide their tracks or deploy payloads.\n\nThere's an event where a file is created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. That's interesting because PowerShell scripts can execute code, so creating such a file might indicate malicious activity. However, it's also possible that this is part of legitimate script testing or setup.\n\nThen, the same file is deleted right after being created. This could be a sign of an attempt to remove evidence, which would raise concern. But sometimes scripts delete temporary files as part of their operation, so I can't be certain yet.\n\nAnother event shows the creation of a .winlogbeat.yml.new file by winlogbeat.exe, which is likely related to log management and shouldn't be suspicious on its own.\n\nThere are multiple Process Create events for powershell.exe and whoami.exe. The whoami.exe process is straightforward as it's used to get user information, but the repeated creation of these processes might indicate some automation or script execution, which could be malicious if there's a loop or persistence mechanism involved.\n\nThe use of Registry value sets in multiple events makes me think about potential persistence mechanisms or configuration changes that attackers might make to maintain access. But without seeing specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nPutting all this together, the repeated and varied activities involving powershell.exe—like file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, loading images, and process accesses—are concerning. These behaviors are often seen in attack chains, especially during lateral movement or when setting up persistence. The deletion of a temporary PowerShell script after its creation is a red flag because it suggests an attempt to cover tracks, which is common in malware.\n\nHowever, I should consider if these actions could be part of legitimate system administration tasks. For example, scripts might create and delete files as part of their operation, but the combination here seems more targeted and possibly automated.\n\nThe confidence level isn't very high because while the behavior is suspicious, there's no definitive evidence like known malicious file hashes or specific registry modifications that are clearly malicious. But the pattern of activities does lean towards potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe accessing registry values, loading images, creating and deleting a temporary .ps1 file, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So I'm given a bunch of events from system logs, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at each event one by one:\n\n1. The first event is \"whoami.exe\" being created with a command line pointing to its usual path. That seems normal; users might be checking their permissions.\n2. Then there are multiple entries of \"powershell.exe\" being accessed, but without any specific commands or parameters mentioned. PowerShell can do a lot, good and bad, so that's something to keep an eye on, especially if it appears several times in quick succession.\n3. There's also \"RuntimeBroker.exe\", which I think is related to Windows updates or background tasks. It accessing the registry might be normal activity.\n4. Notepad and Calculator are standard system tools. Seeing them interact with the registry isn't unusual unless they're doing something unexpected like writing to sensitive areas.\n5. \"svchost.exe\" is a common process that hosts various services, so it's accessing the registry as part of its usual operations.\n6. The winlogbeat.exe event shows a file being created in the user's downloads folder for some configuration file. That could be normal if this tool is running.\n7. There are multiple instances where \"chrome.exe\" makes DNS queries and network connections, which is typical behavior for a web browser.\n\nPutting it all together: While there are several events that individually might raise flags (like multiple PowerShell accesses), the context doesn't show any malicious patterns. No unusual file creations, writes to unexpected registry keys, or signs of data exfiltration. The high frequency of some processes could be suspicious, but without more specific indicators like known malicious commands or access to sensitive files, it's hard to say they're malicious.\n\nHowever, the repeated use of PowerShell might warrant closer investigation because attackers often use it for command execution and lateral movement. But in this batch alone, there's no clear evidence of misuse. So I'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75, meaning it's somewhat possible but not certain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are typical system activities and do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
