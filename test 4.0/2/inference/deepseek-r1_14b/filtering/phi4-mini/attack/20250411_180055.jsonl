{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously, so that's something to note. The first few events show Process Create tasks for whoami.exe and powershell.exe. Not immediately suspicious on their own, but the frequency of powershell executions stands out.\n\nLooking further, I see several Registry value set events from powershell.exe. This could indicate attempts to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms, which are red flags in a potential attack.\n\nThen there are Image loaded tasks for various DLLs. This is normal when running scripts, but combined with the other activities, it might suggest that powershell is executing some code that's loading additional modules or components.\n\nThe File Create and Delete events caught my attention too. Powershell created a temporary .ps1 file and then deleted it shortly after. This behavior is often seen in attempts to bypass script execution policies or as part of malicious activity where the attacker doesn't want evidence left behind.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of Compress-Archive commands with different paths. This seems like an automated process trying to compress files from various directories into temporary zip files. While compression can be legitimate, the combination with powershell and file deletions makes it suspicious.\n\nThe events also show that these actions are happening across multiple processes with similar command lines, varying only in the paths they're accessing. This pattern suggests scripting or automation, possibly indicating a wider spread of malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these together—frequent powershell executions, registry modifications, temporary file creation and deletion, automated compression—it's highly likely that this batch is indicative of malicious behavior. The actions are consistent with common attack tactics like persistence, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes accessing the system, modifying registry values, creating temporary files, and deleting them shortly after.

Let me go through each one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: Powershell is compressing a directory into a zip file. Compress-Archive is a common cmdlet, so that's normal unless it's used maliciously. But here, the path seems legitimate—C:\\pacote_temporario\\objeto_principal\\pacote_principal\\bin\\... Maybe just some script running.\n\nSecond event: Another Powershell command compressing files, destination in TEMP directory. Again, using Compress-Archive, which is standard for archiving. Destination is TEMP, but that's where a lot of apps write temp files.\n\nThird event: Powershell.exe name, no command line—maybe just starting up or part of a script. The log is about Pipe Created. That seems normal as Powershell often creates pipes for commands.\n\nFourth event: Powershell image loaded, with MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. No issue there; it's just loading the DLL as part of its process.\n\nFifth event: Another Compress-Archive command in Powershell, similar to the first two. The file path is pointing to a module, so probably part of script execution.\n\nSixth event: Same structure—powershell using Compress-Archive with destination in TEMP. Looks repetitive but not necessarily malicious.\n\nSeventh event: Another Compress-Archive call. Again, same pattern as before. Repetition could be a sign of something, but each is just archiving different paths.\n\nEighth event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file—probably the agent writing its config or logs. No issues there; it's part of log management.\n\nNinth event: Powershell creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive path. That seems normal if it's related to user profile setup, especially non-interactively.\n\nTenth event: Powershell setting registry values. Registry access can be malicious, but without knowing the exact value and key, it's hard to say. However, this is a common action for configuration.\n\nEleventh event: conhost.exe also setting registry—conhost is a known process host, not suspicious in itself unless it's modifying specific keys that shouldn't change.\n\nTwelfth event: Another Compress-Archive command. Same as before; no immediate red flags.\n\nThirteenth event: Notepad setting a registry value. Not sure why Notepad would do that, but maybe part of some automation or script. Unusual for Notepad but not impossible if it's running via a script.\n\nFourteenth and Fifteenth events: svchost.exe setting registry values multiple times. SvcHost is known to host various services, so frequent registry changes could be normal depending on what service it's running.\n\nPutting this all together, there are several Powershell instances performing Compress-Archive commands, which are legitimate operations. The repeated use of TEMP directories for zipping might raise an eyebrow but isn't inherently malicious without context. The other events like file creation by winlogbeat and registry modifications aren't unusual in a system with active services and scripts.\n\nI don't see any red flags like unusual file paths, access to restricted areas, or known malicious process names (other than the standard Powershell and svchost). The lack of writes to sensitive locations or unexpected binaries being executed makes me lean towards these events not indicating malicious activity. They seem more like normal system operations with some script execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT_INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate Powershell operations such as file compression and registry modifications, which are common in scripting and system administration. There is no indication of malicious activity or unauthorized access.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break down each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nThe first event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal since it's likely the log shipping tool setting up its configuration.\n\nNext, I see ApplicationFrameHost.exe making a registry change. This process is part of the Windows shell, so registry writes are typical and not suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe also changing a registry value. Again, this is expected as many system processes interact with the registry for configuration.\n\nThe next few events are from powershell.exe accessing other processes (ProcessAccess). While PowerShell can be used maliciously, single instances of ProcessAccess aren't always concerning unless combined with other suspicious activities.\n\nThere are several entries from chrome.exe setting registry values multiple times. Browsers often interact with the registry to store settings and preferences, so this is standard behavior.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event accessing a process stands out again but without additional context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed, which is a legitimate system tool used to display user information. It's commonly used in scripts or by users checking their permissions.\n\nFinally, more powershell.exe ProcessAccess events and another Calculator.exe registry change.\n\nPutting this all together, most of these activities are within normal operational parameters. Processes like chrome.exe, Calculator.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, and even winlogbeat.exe performing standard tasks. The repeated RegistryEvent from chrome.exe is part of its operation. While PowerShell can be a red flag, the events here don't show any signs of malicious behavior—like creating or deleting files related to malware, network connections, or other indicators of compromise.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't indicate anything unusual that would warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activities such as process creation, registry modifications, and file operations without any signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
