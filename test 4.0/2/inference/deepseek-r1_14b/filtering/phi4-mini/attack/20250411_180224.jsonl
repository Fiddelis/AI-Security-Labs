{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, the events involve multiple processes: powershell.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe. Notably, schtasks is being used with commands like \/create and \/query, which often are part of persistence mechanisms in malware.\n\nI see several instances where Registry values are being set by different processes. This is a common technique for attackers to establish persistence or modify system configurations maliciously.\n\nAlso, there's an attempt to create a file using powershell.exe with -ep bypass, which suggests an effort to execute PowerShell scripts without the standard execution policy restrictions. However, the script paths mentioned (NonExistingScript.ps1 and entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1) don't exist, which might indicate failed attempts or decoy activity.\n\nThe repeated RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe are unusual. While legitimate software can write to the registry, multiple such events could be a sign of tampering or malicious activity.\n\nProcesses like svchost.exe and conhost.exe are typically associated with Windows services but can also be used by malware for obfuscation. The file creation events under specific paths might be part of setting up a persistent backdoor.\n\nConsidering all these points, the combination of process creations, registry modifications, and script execution attempts raises red flags about potential malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious processes and system changes indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this JSONL data to analyze. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event shows that powershell.exe created a file at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_ativo.txt'. That's interesting because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, and creating files can be part of data exfiltration or setting up persistence.\n\nNext, there are two events where powershell.exe accessed processes. Process access could be normal administrative tasks, but combined with other actions, it might indicate something suspicious.\n\nThe third event is the creation of whoami.exe. Whoami is typically used to get system information. However, in this case, since it's being executed from a user directory and immediately after powershell activity, it raises an eyebrow. Maybe someone is trying to gather system details or elevate privileges.\n\nLooking at all these together: multiple PowerShell instances, file creation, process access, and whoami execution. It seems like a possible attack chainâ€”using powershell for initial access or lateral movement, creating files to store data, accessing processes to escalate privileges, and using whoami to check permissions or system info. This combination could be part of an attack like credential dumping or setting up backdoors.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if each event alone is malicious, but together they look suspicious. The confidence isn't super high because some actions can be benign, but the pattern suggests potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events with file creation and process access, along with whoami.exe execution, suggest possible malicious activity or system reconnaissance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
