{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm seeing a lot of events here, so I'll need to go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where the process is 'powershell.exe'. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to keep an eye on. The first few logs show powershell accessing processes and files, which isn't immediately suspicious on its own but could be part of a larger script.\n\nLooking closer, there's a command line in one of the events: it's invoking a PowerShell script from a .ps1 file located at 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. That path seems a bit convoluted with dots and double backslashes, which might be an attempt to hide the actual location or make it harder to trace. The script is being executed with some error handling and a sleep command, which could indicate that it's part of a more complex operation.\n\nAnother red flag is the creation and deletion of a file in the Temporary folder: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1'. Creating temporary files can be normal, but deleting them right after might suggest an attempt to remove evidence or avoid detection. The fact that this file was both created and then deleted within the same process could indicate a malicious script trying to clean up its traces.\n\nThere are also several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and urlmon.dll. While these are legitimate Windows components, they can sometimes be used in malicious scripts for obfuscation or lateral movement.\n\nOther processes like svchost.exe and sppsvc.exe are creating files and registry entries. Svchost is a common process but it's also often exploited by malware. The file creation by svchost could be part of normal operation, but combined with other events might warrant closer inspection.\n\nAdditionally, the RuntimeBroker.exe loading urlmon.dll isn't unusual, but again, in combination with powershell activity, it adds to the overall picture that something might be amiss.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the use of powershell with a potentially malicious script, temporary file creation\/deletion, and multiple process activities—it seems like this batch of logs could indicate suspicious behavior. While each individual event might not raise too many flags, the combination suggests possible malicious activity, such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with potentially malicious command lines and file operations indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. The user has given me a set of JSONL entries where each line represents an event. My task is to analyze all these events collectively and decide on a single classification.\n\nFirst, I notice that the events are primarily from 'svchost.exe', which is a common Windows process often associated with system services. This isn't immediately suspicious because svchost is used by many legitimate processes.\n\nLooking at the tasks: most of them are either file creation events or image loads. For example, multiple entries show files being created in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download folder with various .dll and .etl extensions. These could be part of normal Windows updates since 'SoftwareDistribution' is a known directory for update-related activities.\n\nI also see some registry value sets by svchost.exe. While registry modifications can be malicious, in this context, they might just be part of legitimate system operations, especially if it's related to the Update Agent or similar components.\n\nThere are a couple of other processes mentioned, like 'backgroundTaskHost.exe' and 'msedgewebview2.exe', loading normal system DLLs. This doesn't raise any red flags as these are standard operations for background tasks and webview components.\n\nThe only event that stands out is the creation of an ETL file in 'waasmedic', but again, this might be part of diagnostic logging by Windows or legitimate software.\n\nI'm considering if there's a pattern indicating malicious activity. For instance, multiple writes to the same directory could indicate something suspicious like file injection or persistence mechanisms. However, since these files are under the SoftwareDistribution and Logs directories, which are standard for updates and system logs, it seems less likely.\n\nAnother thought: 'svchost.exe' is sometimes used by malware because it's a common process name. But in this case, the actions taken don't show signs of malicious behavior like unusual file paths, access to restricted areas, or network activity.\n\nI'm also thinking about confidence level. While I can't be 100% certain without more context, the activities here align closely with normal system operations, especially updates and logging. There's no evidence of anomalies, such as files created outside expected locations, unexpected registry modifications, or signs of process injection.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events don't indicate anything malicious or even slightly concerning beyond typical system behavior. Therefore, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal Windows update and logging activities involving svchost.exe creating files in expected locations such as SoftwareDistribution and Logs. The events do not indicate any malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that the logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. Each entry has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The 'winlog' key seems to detail the type of task or event that occurred, like 'File created' or 'Registry value set'. \n\nLooking at the first few events, I see that svchost.exe is involved in creating files and setting registry values. Svchost.exe is a common Windows process that can be legitimate but sometimes used by malware because it's a signed Microsoft process. The file paths here are under C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download, which is a standard location for Windows Update-related files. That doesn't immediately raise red flags, but I should keep an eye out.\n\nThen there are multiple events where svchost.exe sets registry values. Doing some research, I know that modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure it runs on each boot. The fact that this happens several times might be a point of interest.\n\nNext, I see MpSigStub.exe creating files in the Windows Temp directory with GUID-like names. MpSigStub is related to Microsoft Defender, so its activity should be legitimate. However, the specific file paths and the number of files created here could indicate some kind of update or signature download, but it's worth checking if this volume is normal.\n\nThere are also events from setup.exe creating files in Program Files. Setup.exe is commonly used for installing software. The paths mentioned point to EdgeCore components, which makes sense as part of a browser installation or update. I don't see anything suspicious here unless these files are being overwritten unexpectedly.\n\nLastly, MsMpEng.exe loading mpengine.dll seems normal because that's related to Windows Defender operations.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated file creations by svchost.exe and multiple registry modifications could be concerning. While some of these activities are part of normal system operations, the combination might indicate potential malicious behavior, especially since svchost.exe is known for being exploited. However, without more context or additional indicators like timestamps or user activity, it's hard to be certain. But given the patterns, I'd say there's enough to consider this batch as interesting but not conclusively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\n1. **Event Analysis:**\n   - Each event logs a process, an action (file creation, registry change), and associated file details.\n   - Notable processes include svchost.exe, MpSigStub.exe, setup.exe, and MsMpEng.exe.\n\n2. **svchost.exe Activity:**\n   - Creates files under C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download.\n   - Performs multiple registry modifications.\n   - Potential concern due to its common use in both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\n3. **MpSigStub.exe and Setup.exe:**\n   - MpSigStub creates files related to Microsoft Defender in the Temp directory.\n   - Setup.exe installs EdgeCore components, which is normal unless files are modified unexpectedly.\n\n4. **MsMpEng.exe:**\n   - Loads mpengine.dll as part of Windows Defender operations, which is expected behavior.\n\n5. **Indicators of Suspicious Activity:**\n   - Multiple registry changes by svchost.exe could be persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n   - The volume and nature of file creations might indicate unusual system activity.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   While some activities are normal, the combination of svchost.exe's actions and multiple registry modifications raises concern. Further investigation is recommended to assess potential malicious intent.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe batch of logs exhibits potentially concerning behavior due to svchost.exe's file creation and registry modifications, which could indicate malicious activity despite some events being legitimate system operations. Therefore, the logs are considered **interesting** in a cybersecurity context."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two entries where setup.exe creates files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. That seems normal since Edge might update its components, but I should keep an eye on whether these files are legitimate or if they're being created maliciously.\n\nNext, RuntimeBroker.exe is accessing a registry value. Runtime Broker usually handles user runtime events, so some registry activity isn't unusual, especially during system operations.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being run with the command line pointing to its usual location. That doesn't look suspicious on the surface, but I wonder why it's being executed in this context.\n\nNow, looking at the powershell.exe events: multiple instances are detected with different tasks. The first one is just a process access, which could be normal. However, there's an event where PowerShell is creating a new service using New-Service and Start-Service commands. That catches my attention because creating services via PowerShell can be a red flag for persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event creates a script file in the Temp directory and then deletes it almost immediately after creation. This behavior seems odd; why create and delete a script so quickly? It might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or leave less evidence behind, which is a common tactic in malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are several registry modifications by services.exe. While this could be part of legitimate system operations, repeated writes to the registry can sometimes indicate tampering with system configurations, possibly for persistence or other malicious purposes.\n\nFinally, tarefa_logico.exe is loading some DLLs, which might not be concerning on their own, but combined with the other events involving PowerShell and service creation, it adds another layer of potential concern.\n\nPutting this all together: there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. The use of PowerShell to create and delete a script file, along with creating new services, stands out as particularly concerning. These actions could be part of an attack chain where an adversary is trying to establish persistence or execute malicious code. The confidence level isn't extremely high because some of the events might have benign explanations, but overall, there are enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activity, including suspicious file creations and deletions by PowerShell, creation of a new service via PowerShell, and repeated registry modifications. These activities may indicate an attack chain or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is named \"tarefa_logico.exe\". This seems suspicious because it's a Portuguese name meaning \"logical task\", which could be malicious. These processes are loading DLLs from the .NET framework directory. The paths look standard, but the fact that they're being loaded by an unknown process might indicate something fishy.\n\nNext, there are several events where the process is \"powershell.exe\". I know PowerShell can be used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. Looking at the tasks, some are file creations in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a bit unusual because it's not a common location, and creating files there might be an attempt to persist across reboots.\n\nThen, I see registry value sets under PowerShell. Modifying the registry can be part of malicious activities like installing persistent malware or changing system configurations without user consent. The path mentioned in the file field for some events is pointing to \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The term \"registro\" means \"registry\" in Portuguese, so this script might be trying to interact with the registry in a way that's not typical.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple entries where the command line is a PowerShell script. This script imports a module from \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The path is a bit convoluted, which makes me think it's trying to hide or confuse the location of the malicious script. The script then tries to execute some function called Invoke-entrada_principal with an output directory set to the Temp folder. This sounds like an attempt to drop files there, possibly for persistence or further actions.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries where PowerShell is used to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\". Services can be a way for malware to start automatically on boot, making it persistent. The binary path points to tarefa_logico.exe, which ties back to the earlier process entries. This suggests that the script is setting up a service to run this executable at startup, indicating a possible persistence mechanism.\n\nI also notice multiple repeated command lines and tasks, especially with the same PowerShell scripts being executed several times. Repetition like this often indicates automated or malicious activity trying different approaches or ensuring commands are successful.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows suspicious activities involving both tarefa_logico.exe and powershell.exe. There's evidence of script execution, file creation in non-standard locations, registry modifications, and service creation attempts. These actions collectively suggest possible malicious behavior, such as installing malware with persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as interesting because it exhibits several red flags that are commonly associated with cyberattacks or malware activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events indicate potential malicious activity involving PowerShell executing scripts from non-standard paths and creating services, suggesting a possible attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial events from lines 1-4: They all have a process command line that runs powershell.exe with some commands. The command seems to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to an executable path and then starts that service. This is done using PowerShell, which is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nNext, lines 5-8: These events show the same process as before but with a different task in winlog—\"Engine Lifecycle\". Still related to services, so maybe part of the setup or configuration phase.\n\nMoving on to lines 9-14: These are multiple events where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\", and the file path points to a PowerShell script at C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\ComponenteAuxiliar.ps1. This suggests that a remote command is being executed, possibly invoking this script. The frequency of these events (seven times) could indicate repeated attempts or part of a process.\n\nLines 15-20: Here, the process is named \"services.exe\", which is legitimate as it's part of Windows service management. But it's paired with a logon event and then more remote command executions pointing to the same script path as before.\n\nPutting this together, I notice that there are multiple attempts to create a new service using PowerShell, followed by executing a remote command script repeatedly. The creation of services via PowerShell can be malicious, especially if the script is downloading or executing other binaries. The repeated execution of ComponenteAuxiliar.ps1 could mean it's part of a larger payload delivery or establishing persistence.\n\nThe combination of creating a new service and executing scripts remotely raises flags because attackers often use such techniques for persistence or to run malicious code. The repetition of these events suggests possible automation or an attempt to ensure the script runs multiple times, which is another red flag.\n\nI'm also considering if this could be legitimate activity, like system updates or script executions, but given the repeated nature and specific file paths, it seems more suspicious. There's no indication of known legitimate processes here that would involve creating services and remote commands in such a way.\n\nSo, overall, the batch shows multiple indicators of potential malicious activity: PowerShell usage for service creation, remote command execution scripts, and repetition which could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or spread.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious activity including repeated PowerShell command executions creating a new service and executing a remote script. This combination suggests potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of 15 events. Each one is almost identical with the same task and file path. The task is \"Execute a Remote Command,\" which could be malicious if it's part of an attack. However, since all entries are exactly the same and there's no variation or additional context, like multiple files being accessed or unusual times, it seems routine. Maybe this script runs regularly as part of normal operations. So I'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING because there's no indication of something wrong beyond a single repeated event.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of identical events indicating the execution of a remote command from the same file path, which does not show signs of malicious activity or anomalies.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
