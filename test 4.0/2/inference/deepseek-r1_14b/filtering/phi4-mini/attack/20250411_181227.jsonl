I'm looking at a batch of events from system logs, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that create scheduled tasks. Each event has a similar structure but different names like \"unidade_ativo\" and \"registro_geral\". These look like scheduled task names created by the script. The commands are using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe at logon, which seems suspicious because it's a common malicious technique to persistence.\n\nThen there are other events where powershell.exe is accessing processes or registry values. The registry write attempts could be another red flag—malware often uses registry keys for persistence or to store configuration data.\n\nThere's also an event where chrome.exe creates a pipe, which might not be suspicious on its own but worth noting in the context of the overall activity.\n\nThe ImageLoad events for mscoree.dll and clr.dll are related to .NET runtime, which is normal, so probably not an issue here.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated powershell commands creating scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe at logon could indicate a persistence mechanism used by attackers. The combination of multiple registry writes and process accesses adds to the concern. This pattern suggests potential malicious activity worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe as the action, suggesting potential malicious persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, several entries show PowerShell.exe loading images and creating files. For example, there's a file created in the Temp directory named with random characters: __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. Then it gets deleted quickly. That seems suspicious because creating and deleting scripts can be part of malicious activities.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is being used to execute commands, specifically creating scheduled tasks. The command lines show actions like Register-ScheduledTask with names like estrutura_auxiliar and unidade_comum. These task names don't seem meaningful and might be obfuscated or random, which is a red flag for malicious scripts.\n\nLooking at the other events, Chrome.exe is making several registry changes. While legitimate software can modify the registry, the number of entries here is quite high—six in total—which might indicate something abnormal, though it's less concerning than PowerShell activities.\n\nThen there are multiple events where the process is None but the task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. This could mean that remote commands are being executed without a visible process, which is worrying as it suggests potential unauthorized access or command execution.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated PowerShell activity with file creation\/deletion, scheduled tasks registration, and remote command executions. These behaviors are often linked to malware or attacks trying to maintain persistence on the system. The combination of these events across multiple processes makes me confident that this batch is indeed interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activity including file creation\/deletion, scheduled task registration, and remote command executions, indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL data provided, there are several events from different processes like WmiPrvSE.exe, svchost.exe, powershell.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. Each event has details about the process name, the Windows log task, and a file path if applicable.\n\nLet me go through each event one by one to understand what's happening:\n\n1. The first event shows WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. I know that svchost and other system processes often load these DLLs, so it might be normal.\n2. Next, there are multiple events from svchost.exe setting registry values. That could be suspicious because svchost is a common process used by malware to hide activities. But sometimes legitimate software also uses it, so I can't jump to conclusions yet.\n3. Then, an event where svchost.exe creates a file at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. That path doesn't look standard. It might be creating a task or something else. I'm not sure if that's malicious.\n4. There's an event with no process name but mentions executing a remote command. That sounds risky because it could indicate a shell being used to run commands remotely, which is often a sign of hacking or unauthorized access.\n5. Powershell.exe creating files in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell directory. I know that PowerShell can be used maliciously, but sometimes legitimate scripts also use it. The file names like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive seem normal, but I'm not certain.\n6. Another powershell.exe event setting a registry value and creating files in the Downloads folder with specific filenames (entrada_principal.txt and objeto_auxiliar.txt). These filenames are arbitrary, but having multiple PowerShell operations could be part of malicious activities like dropping files or altering system configurations.\n7. Conhost.exe, which is associated with command-line interfaces, setting registry values. Again, it's a common process, but the activity might not be normal if it's part of an attack chain.\n8. Chrome.exe has several events loading DLLs and setting registry values. This could be legitimate browser activity or part of an exploit. The specific DLL path (MpOAV.dll) seems related to Windows Defender, so probably benign.\n9. Winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files in the Downloads folder. I know winlogbeat is a log shipping tool, often used by sysadmins, so unless it's being misused, this might be normal.\n10. Multiple chrome.exe events querying DNS. This seems standard for web browsing.\n\nNow, looking at the overall picture: there are several instances where svchost.exe and powershell.exe are performing actions that could be part of malicious behavior. The remote command execution is a red flag because it suggests unauthorized access or lateral movement within a network. Additionally, powershell.exe creating multiple files in non-standard locations might indicate script activity, which can be malicious.\n\nHowever, some events could also be legitimate. For example, chrome.exe loading DLLs and querying DNS is normal for a browser. Svchost.exe setting registry values isn't necessarily suspicious on its own, but when combined with other activities like creating unknown files or remote commands, it becomes concerning.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about the context of these logs. Are they from a single system? How recent are they? Without more information, it's hard to say definitively if this is an attack. But given the combination of svchost.exe, powershell.exe activities, and a remote command execution, there's enough cause for concern that further investigation would be warranted.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think this batch does merit closer examination because several red flags are present, even though some events might be normal.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple potentially suspicious activities including remote command execution and file creations by svchost.exe and powershell.exe in non-standard locations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
