Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems pretty normal because it's a standard command used to get user information. Not too suspicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. The first one has a command line that looks like it's searching for files containing 'pass' in various file types. That could be concerning because it might indicate someone is looking for password-related information. Powershell is often used by attackers for its scripting capabilities and the ability to execute commands.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe accesses files or images load into it. The fact that a script is being created in the Temp directory and then deleted shortly after could be an indicator of malicious activity. Often, attackers will create temporary scripts to perform actions and delete them afterward to cover their tracks.\n\nThere's also an event involving \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file, which I think is related to log management. Not sure if that's relevant here unless it's part of some attack vector.\n\nAnother event shows calc.exe loading a system DLL, which isn't unusual since many applications use URLMON.DLL for handling URLs.\n\nThere are multiple events where svchost.exe sets registry values. SvcHost is a legitimate process used by Windows services, but changes to the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware. However, without more context on what exactly was changed, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nPutting all these together: repeated powershell.exe processes with specific command lines searching for passwords, creating and deleting temporary scripts, along with other process creations that might indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration. These patterns could be signs of a cyberattack where an attacker is trying to gather sensitive information using common tools like powershell inappropriately.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of actions, particularly the powershell script activity and file deletions, suggests potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe with command lines indicating search for password-related information in various files.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an OfficeClickToRun.exe process doing a DNS query. That seems normal because many applications perform DNS lookups.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command: it's searching for keywords like \"pass\" in various file types. This could be suspicious since it might indicate data scraping or credential harvesting.\n\nThen, another event shows powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory. That location is typically used by PowerShell to store profile data when running non-interactively, but I'm not sure if this is normal behavior for all users.\n\nThe chrome.exe process has several events: pipe creation, DNS queries, and registry changes. Some of these might be standard operations for Chrome, especially loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are legitimate Windows components. However, the network connections could be monitoring or exfiltration attempts.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe execution without any suspicious command lines—it just gets user info, so probably not malicious on its own.\n\nA cmd.exe process is deleting scheduled tasks with specific names. This might be part of system maintenance, but if these task names are related to legitimate processes, it could be normal. However, unusual task names or multiple deletions might raise a flag.\n\nAnother schtasks.exe deletion event—again, similar to the previous one. It's about managing scheduled tasks, which is a common administrative activity.\n\nThe WMIC.exe command is deleting notepad.exe processes. That's interesting because WMI is often used by malware for persistence or remote management. Deleting Notepad might seem innocuous, but in certain contexts, it could be hiding malicious activities.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple PowerShell instances executing scripts, including searching for sensitive keywords; deletion of scheduled tasks using schtasks and cmd; and WMIC commands to delete processes. These actions don't necessarily indicate malicious activity on their own, but the combination—especially the use of tools like PowerShell and WMI with potentially suspicious command lines—raises concerns about possible compromise or lateral movement within a network.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because some behaviors are unusual, even if they might have legitimate explanations. The confidence is high enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events involving PowerShell executing commands that search for sensitive keywords in various file types, deletions of scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe and cmd.exe, and the use of WMIC.exe to delete processes.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm new to analyzing system logs, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events provided, each line represents a JSON object with details about processes, windows log tasks, and files involved. The goal is to determine if the entire batch should be investigated further for potential malicious activity.\n\nI see several instances where 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' are being used. For example, one event shows cmd.exe deleting a user account: \"net user \\\/del \\\"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\\\"\". That seems like legitimate admin work, but maybe too many such commands could be suspicious. Also, there's a command to delete the service 'win32times' using sc.exe, which might be trying to remove something malicious.\n\nThere are multiple entries where registry values are being set or deleted, which is common in malware for persistence. The repeated use of powershell and cmd with different commands could indicate someone trying various methods to gain access or cover their tracks.\n\nSome events have 'None' for files, but the process names and command lines stand out. The deletion of user accounts via net.exe and net1.exe might be an attempt to remove traces or escalate privileges. Also, using whoami.exe could be checking permissions or user context.\n\nThe fact that multiple tools are being used in quick succession, like cmd, powershell, sc.exe, and even deleting temp files, makes me think this activity isn't normal. It could be a script trying different ways to maintain persistence or cover its tracks.\n\nI'm not sure if these actions alone are enough to classify as malicious, but the combination seems concerning. The confidence level is around 0.8 because while each event might seem innocent on its own, together they suggest potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creations and deletions, including potentially malicious commands and file operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The main components in each event are the process information, Windows log task, and file details.\n\nLooking at the first event, cmd.exe is deleting a file located at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe. This deletion might be suspicious because it's removing an executable file, which could indicate malicious activity trying to cover its tracks.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving whoami.exe and powershell.exe. Whoami.exe is often used to determine user information, but repeated executions without a clear purpose could be concerning. However, it's also common for legitimate scripts or processes to use this command, so context is needed here.\n\nPowershell.exe appears numerous times with various tasks like ProcessCreate, ProcessAccess, ImageLoad, and File operations. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by both admins and attackers. The multiple file creations and deletions (like creating __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1 and then deleting it) might indicate script execution or testing. This behavior could be part of legitimate scripting, but it's also a common technique in attacks to create temporary files and then delete them to avoid detection.\n\nThe deletion events for both cmd.exe and powershell.exe are particularly notable because they involve removing executable files from the Temp directory, which is a common tactic in malware to erase evidence after execution.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a pattern of processes creating, accessing, and deleting files, especially using powershell.exe. While not conclusive on their own, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior, such as script execution or file deletion activities that might be part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of file deletions and process creations involving potentially malicious activities like cmd.exe deleting files and powershell.exe performing numerous actions, including creating and deleting temporary files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break them down one by one.\n\nThe first two entries are processes named \"calc.exe\" and \"Calculator.exe\", both loading the same file \"urlmon.dll\". This seems normal since these are standard Windows executables, and urlmon is a legitimate DLL used for URL handling.\n\nNext, there's an event from \"winlogbeat.exe\" about creating a new config file. Winlogbeat is likely part of the ELK stack for log management, so this is expected behavior as it sets up its configuration.\n\nThen, I see \"powershell.exe\" accessing something without a file path. PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, but in this case, there's no indication of suspicious activity—just an access event.\n\nThe majority of the logs are from \"chrome.exe\", including DNS queries and network connections. These are typical actions for any browser when navigating the web, so nothing stands out as unusual here.\n\nPutting it all together, none of these events indicate malicious behavior or anything outside normal system operations.
