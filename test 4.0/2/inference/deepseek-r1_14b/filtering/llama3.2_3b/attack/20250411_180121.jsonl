{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. I'm trying to figure out if these events are interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting, but it can also be abused by attackers. Looking closely, some of the command lines have URLs pointing to GitHub repositories. The commands look like they're trying to download files using WebClient. That could be a red flag because downloading files from external sources might indicate malicious activity or data exfiltration.\n\nThere are several events where `powershell.exe` is called with specific command-line arguments that create new processes to download files into the Temp directory. For example:\n```\n\"process\":\"{'command_line': 'powershell.exe & {(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(\\\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/objeto_base\/objeto_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt\\\", \\\"$env:TEMP\\\\modulo_padrao.txt\\\")}'}\n```\nThese downloads are to various `.txt` files in the Temp directory. While LICENSE.txt is a common file, the fact that they're being downloaded from different repositories and saved with varying names might indicate some automated or malicious script activity.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where `winlogbeat.exe` creates a new YAML configuration file:\n```\n\"process\":\"{'name': 'winlogbeat.exe'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'}\"\n```\nWinlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so this could be normal unless it's part of a larger suspicious activity.\n\nI also see some registry changes from `chrome.exe`:\n```\n\"process\":\"{'name': 'chrome.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\"\n```\nWhile Chrome can modify the registry, multiple such events could be worth investigating to ensure they're not setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother thing is the network connections detected from various processes. For example:\n```\n\"process\":\"{'name': 'chrome.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Network connection detected (rule: NetworkConnect)'}\"\n```\nWhile Chrome does make network requests, multiple such events or unusual destinations could be concerning.\n\nTaking all this into account, the repeated use of PowerShell with external file downloads and the creation of various files in the Temp directory are significant indicators. These actions can be part of malicious scripts attempting to download payloads or gather information. The fact that they're using GitHub repositories might not necessarily be bad, but combined with the other activities, it increases suspicion.\n\nOverall, while some events could be normal, the pattern of multiple PowerShell downloads and file creations in the Temp directory suggests potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances downloading files from external sources into the Temp directory, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this JSONL data to figure out if it's interesting or not for investigation. I'll start by going through each event and noting down any potential red flags or signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst up is the creation of a file by winlogbeat.exe. That seems normal since it's likely part of their logging setup, but I should keep an eye on the filename to ensure it's not something suspicious.\n\nNext, Notepad.exe setting a registry value doesn't immediately raise alarms unless there's an unusual key being modified, which isn't evident here.\n\nThe Calculator and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll could be concerning. URLMON is related to handling URLs, so this might indicate some network activity or potential for injecting malicious scripts.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of cmd.exe being run with commands like SCHTASKS to delete tasks and REG DELETE to remove registry entries. These command-line actions are red flags because they're often used by attackers to cover their tracks or create persistence mechanisms.\n\nPowershell.exe is appearing a few times, both in process creation and loading modules. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be abused for malicious purposes, so repeated executions could be suspicious. The command lines here seem generic, but the frequency might warrant closer look.\n\nSchtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll is another point of interest since it's related to scheduling tasks. If these tasks are set up without proper authorization or with unusual names, it could indicate malicious activity.\n\nSVCHOST.exe modifying registry objects is concerning because svchost is a legitimate process but can be used by malware to hide themselves within the system processes.\n\nFinally, there are several instances of Powershell.exe being called with \"& {}\" which is an argument that doesn't do much on its own. However, in some contexts, this could be part of obfuscation techniques or command chaining.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of process creation and modifications to the registry, especially using cmd.exe to delete tasks and registry entries. These actions are often seen in attempts to remove traces of malicious activity or set up persistence. The repeated use of Powershell.exe could be an attempt to execute scripts without being detected easily. While each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior that's worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activities such as process creations with command-line arguments suggesting deletion of tasks and registry entries (e.g., SCHTASKS, REG DELETE), repeated Powershell.exe executions, and suspicious file operations. These actions may indicate an attempt to remove traces or establish persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, the initial events involve `powershell.exe` being used with some command lines that look like \"& {}\". That might be a bit odd because usually, you'd see specific commands after \"&\", so I'm wondering if this is normal PowerShell usage or something more suspicious. Then there are multiple entries where `winlogbeat.exe` creates a file. Winlogbeat is typically an agent for forwarding logs, but the path mentioned seems like it's part of its installation process, so that might not be concerning on its own.\n\nLooking further down, I see several instances where different executables like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and again `powershell.exe` are being run. The command lines for cmd.exe look incomplete, which is a bit unusual. When cmd is used with \"\/c\", it usually runs a single command, but the command line seems cut off here. This could indicate that something was truncated or that the process didn't have a complete command to execute.\n\nThere's also a lot of registry access events. Processes accessing the registry can be normal, especially for configuration, but multiple such events from different processes might raise an eyebrow. Additionally, the repeated use of `powershell.exe` with various image loads and deletions could indicate that PowerShell is being used in a loop or script, which is common for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nOne event stands out: a file deletion involving a PowerShell script test file. The path includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which suggests it's related to testing script execution policies. Malicious scripts often try to delete evidence or disable security features, so this could be a red flag. Moreover, the combination of multiple registry changes and file deletions might indicate attempts to remove traces of malicious activities or to modify system configurations to facilitate persistence.\n\nConsidering all these points together—multiple PowerShell executions with unclear command lines, numerous registry accesses, and a suspicious file deletion—it seems like there's enough activity that could be indicative of malicious behavior. While some events on their own might not raise concerns, the pattern over the entire batch suggests potential malicious intent or at least unusual system usage that merits closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell executions with unclear command lines, registry accesses, and a suspicious file deletion, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. The command lines here show attempts like Remove-Item, which deletes files in the TEMP directory with ErrorAction Ignore, meaning it won't throw an error if the file doesn't exist. This could indicate malicious activity trying to remove evidence.\n\nThere are several registry value sets and process accesses involving powershell.exe. These actions can be part of persistence mechanisms or lateral movement within a network, which are red flags for potential compromise.\n\nAdditionally, there's a whoami.exe execution, which might be used by attackers to check user permissions or system information. Combined with the powershell activity, this adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe TEMP directory deletions are concerning because they often happen during cleanup after an attack to remove traces of malicious activities. The repeated attempts to delete specific files with similar names suggest a pattern that's not typical for legitimate processes.\n\nWhile some events like chrome.exe loading DLLs and registry checks might be normal, the sheer number of powershell executions with suspicious command lines stands out. This volume is unusual unless it's part of a concerted effort to hide malicious actions.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, the batch shows a sequence of potentially malicious activities that warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious command lines attempting to delete files in TEMP directory, combined with registry modifications and other process activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. First, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate scripting but can also be a red flag because attackers often abuse it for executing malicious commands.\n\nLooking at the first event, powershell.exe is running with a command line argument that removes a file in the TEMP directory. The use of -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore might indicate an attempt to delete files without user interaction or logging, which could be suspicious. Additionally, there are several ImageLoad events for different DLLs, which might be part of normal operations, but when combined with other actions, they could be part of a larger script's execution.\n\nAnother event shows that powershell.exe is creating pipes, which can be used for inter-process communication. While not inherently malicious, in the context of multiple file deletions and other activities, it raises an eyebrow. There are also instances where specific files like .txt are being deleted from the TEMP directory, which could be part of data exfiltration or cleanup routines.\n\nThere's a series of events where powershell.exe is accessing processes, and whoami.exe is being executed multiple times. Whoami is usually harmless, but frequent executions might suggest credential dumping or information gathering by an attacker.\n\nFurthermore, there are several Registry value sets from chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. While these could be legitimate updates, the combination with other suspicious activities could imply some form of persistence or configuration changes that shouldn't be there.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with file deletions, pipe creation, process access, and whoami executions is concerning. These actions don't seem to align with normal user behavior and might indicate a malicious script trying to cover its tracks by deleting files and gathering information.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe running commands, including file deletions from the TEMP directory. Suspicious activity includes repeated process creations and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
