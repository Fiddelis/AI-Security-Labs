Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are two events related to MicrosoftEdge.exe. One says a file was created, and another mentions the file creation time changed. That seems normal because Edge might be updating or installing something. The path looks like it's part of the update process, so probably not malicious.\n\nNext up is CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll. I know that DLLs can sometimes be related to anti-malware stuff, but in this case, it's just the system loading its own modules. Not suspicious.\n\nThen there are several entries with \"Special Logon\" and \"User Account Management.\" These usually happen when user sessions are being created or managed, which is pretty standard Windows activity. Nothing fishy here unless there's an unusual pattern, but these seem routine.\n\nOne event stands out: a PowerShell command being executed with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The command tries to check for certain sections in .inf files. That could be malicious because scripts often do this kind of checking as part of lateral movement or data exfiltration. But since it's using -ExecutionPolicy Restricted, maybe it's trying to bypass some security measures.\n\nThere are a few more image loads and process creations. Svchost.exe is a common system process, so unless it's running something unexpected, that's normal. CompatTelRunner again loading taskschd.dll seems okay too.\n\nI also see some file creation events related to svchost.exe creating files in the DeliveryOptimization directory. That sounds legitimate because Windows uses this for updating and managing services.\n\nAnother event is MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating a new Edge update file, which aligns with regular update processes.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe loading Defender-related DLLs is expected as part of the antivirus service.\n\nThen there's an edge case: MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe deleting a file in the user's Temp directory. It could be cleaning up after an update, so that's probably normal unless it's deleting something unexpected.\n\nFinally, another MpCmdRun creating a lock file in Temp—again, seems related to Defender operations.\n\nPutting it all together, most events are standard Windows and application activities like updates, process creations, and system DLL loads. The PowerShell command is the only potentially concerning part because executing scripts with certain policies can be a red flag for malicious activity. But without more context, it's hard to say definitively. Still, considering that a lot of these are normal, I'm leaning towards this batch not being particularly interesting. However, the presence of the PowerShell command does raise some questions.\n\nI think the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because, while there's a possible red flag with PowerShell, the majority of events don't indicate malicious behavior. The confidence is medium because that one event could be suspicious, but without additional context or anomalies, it's not enough to classify the entire batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The log entries primarily consist of normal system activities such as process creations, file updates, and system service operations. While there is a PowerShell command execution noted, it appears to be part of legitimate system processes or updates.\",\n  \"confidence_level\": \"medium\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event shows that MpCmdRun.exe was loaded. I know that MpCmdRun.exe is related to Windows Defender, which is an antivirus tool. So this is probably just the system running its normal processes for threat detection. Nothing unusual here, but I'll keep it in mind as context.\n\nNext, there's a null process and no file activity. This seems like a placeholder or maybe an empty event, so I can ignore that.\n\nThen, starting from the third event, all of them involve git.exe creating files in a path related to node_modules\/semver. Git is a version control system, and node_modules is where Node.js packages are stored. The file paths look like they're part of a typical npm (Node Package Manager) setup. Semver stands for semantic versioning, which is commonly used in software development for managing package versions.\n\nSo, these events are showing that files related to the semver package are being created during a git operation. This seems like standard behavior when a developer is working on a project that uses Node.js and npm. The system is just installing or updating dependencies as part of the build process.\n\nLooking at all these together, it's a series of file creation events tied to a known legitimate software component (semver) being used in a development environment. There’s no indication of any unauthorized access, malicious activity, or anything out of the ordinary for such an environment.\n\nI should also consider if there are any red flags here. The presence of git.exe and node_modules doesn't raise alarms on their own—they're common tools. Additionally, semver is a widely used library without known malware associations. \n\nThe initial event with MpCmdRun.exe might look suspicious at first glance because it's an executable file, but since it's associated with Windows Defender, which scans for threats, it's part of normal system operation.\n\nPutting all this together, the batch doesn't show any signs of malicious behavior or indicators of compromise. It looks like routine activities related to software development and system processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to legitimate file creation during a Node.js package installation, which is common in software development environments.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me look through each event. \n\nEach line is a JSON object representing an event. The key details in each are the process name as \"git.exe\", the task as \"File created\" under Windows logs, and the file path.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\". This seems to be a user's directory on their local machine. The files being created are inside node_modules folders, like semver, serialize-javascript, and set-function-length. These are npm packages.\n\nGiven that git.exe is the process, it likely means the user is working with Node.js projects, as git is often used for version control in such environments. The creation of these files is part of installing or updating npm modules, which is a common activity when developing with Node.js.\n\nThere's nothing unusual here. No signs of malicious activities like multiple failed login attempts, access to restricted areas, or unexpected file creations in system directories. All events are related to a user's development environment and are expected during project setup or updates.\n\nSo, considering all events together, they don't indicate any suspicious behavior.

Let's start by looking at the data.\n\nAll these events are from Git.exe creating files in a Node.js module directory. The paths look like typical npm package structures. Each event is labeled as a file creation under FileCreate rule, which isn't unusual.\n\nI remember that when you clone a Git repository with submodules or install Node modules, Git might create these files automatically during setup. So seeing multiple file creations from Git.exe in a node_modules directory seems normal.\n\nNo signs of unauthorized access or suspicious activities here. All the paths are standard for development environments. There's no indication of file deletions, accesses outside the expected directories, or any other red flags.\n\nSince all events fit a common scenario during development setup, they're probably not malicious.

Each event is a JSON object with details about a file creation task by the git.exe process. All the file paths are within a node_modules directory under a user's Downloads folder, which suggests it's related to a Node.js project setup or updates.\n\nI notice that each entry has a consistent pattern: the process is git.exe, the task is creating a file, and the paths point to various modules like 'side-channel', 'signal-exit', 'slice-ansi', and 'sshpk'. These are all typical Node.js packages. The files created include JavaScript files, package.json, README.md, and LICENSE, which aligns with how npm (Node Package Manager) installs dependencies.\n\nSince git.exe is commonly used for version control in development environments, this activity is expected during the setup or updates of a project. There's no indication of unusual file names, access times outside normal hours, or any signs of file sizes that might suggest malicious content. All paths are within the user's directory structure and don't point to system critical areas.\n\nConsidering all events together, it appears to be part of a legitimate software development workflow.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of JSONL events to analyze as a cybersecurity expert. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let's break down each event and see what we can find.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, each JSON object has three main parts: process information, windows log details, and file path details. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\", which makes me think that Git is being used here. The task in the winlog is always \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a file was created.\n\nThe files being created are all located under different paths within a node_modules directory, like sshpk and string-width. These look like they're part of a Node.js project's dependencies. For example, \"sshpk\" might be used for SSH key management, and \"string-width\" is likely related to measuring string widths in terminals.\n\nNow, considering that Git is being used, this could mean someone is cloning a repository or working on a project. The creation of files under node_modules suggests that perhaps npm packages are being installed or fetched. Since these are standard package names, this seems like normal development activity rather than anything malicious.\n\nI should also check if there's any variation in the events that might indicate something suspicious. All events have similar structures and file paths within a project directory. There's no indication of access to sensitive files or unusual file creation times. Plus, Git and npm are common tools, so their usage alone doesn't raise red flags.\n\nAnother angle: could this be part of an automated process? CI\/CD pipelines often use Git and might clone repositories and install dependencies as part of the build process. That's another normal scenario that wouldn't require investigation unless there's evidence of unauthorized access or anomalies.\n\nSince all events are related to creating files in a Node.js project directory, I don't see any signs of malicious activity. This batch doesn't indicate anything out of the ordinary for a developer environment.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities during Git operations and Node.js package installations, which are typical in development environments.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by analyzing each event and see what's going on.\n\nAll the events are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. Each one has three main parts: process info, winlog details, and file information.\n\nThe process name in every event is \"git.exe\". That makes sense because Git is often used for version control and can create files as part of its operations. The task in the winlog is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a file was created. So each event is about a file being created by the Git process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to locations within a directory structure under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\". The specific files include things like index.js, license, package.json, readme.md, and others. These are typical files you'd find in a Node.js module or package.\n\nSo, putting this together, it seems that Git is cloning or pulling a repository into the node_modules folder. This is common during development when dependencies are being fetched or updated. The creation of these files is part of the normal setup process for a project using Node.js and npm.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here. All events are related to file creation by Git, which is expected in a development environment. There's no indication of access to sensitive files, attempts to execute code, or other suspicious activities that might warrant investigation.\n\nTherefore, while the events themselves are legitimate, they don't raise any red flags. They fit the pattern of normal software development operations, specifically around managing and installing dependencies for a Node.js project.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Git creating files within a node_modules directory, which is typical during dependency installation in a Node.js project.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So I'm given a bunch of JSONL events, each one showing that git.exe created a file in the node_modules\/tcomb directory with various filenames like Date.js, RegExp.js, etc.\n\nHmm, first thought: Git is often used for version control, and when you clone or pull a repository, it's normal for it to create files. The paths look like they're part of a Node.js module since they're under node_modules. \n\nThe user mentioned that the events show multiple file creations from git.exe in this specific directory. I remember that sometimes during development, especially with tools like npm install, you might see a lot of file operations as dependencies are being extracted or updated.\n\nI should check if these files are legitimate parts of the project. Tcomb is a known library for TypeScript, so it's a standard package. The paths under node_modules\/tcomb seem to be expected locations for its modules.\n\nAnother angle: Could this activity indicate something malicious? Well, git.exe is a common tool, and the file operations here don't show any signs of being out of place. They're all within the same directory, creating expected files. There's no unusual access times or permissions changes mentioned.\n\nWait, but sometimes attackers might use legitimate tools for malicious purposes. However, in this case, it seems more like normal development activity. The frequency is a burst of file creations, which makes sense during an install or update process.\n\nSo considering all this, the batch doesn't seem suspicious. It's likely just part of building or updating a Node.js project using Git.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions by git.exe within a node_modules directory, which is typical during development activities such as cloning repositories or installing dependencies.
