{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"This is a JSON log format that appears to be generated by a security information and event management (SIEM) system or a log collection tool. The log contains four fields: \"process\", \"winlog\", \"file\", and a base64-encoded field named \"cfev\".\n\nHere's a breakdown of each field:\n\n1. **\"process\"**: This field contains information about the process that triggered the event. In this case, it's usually empty or contains some basic information like the process name.\n2. **\"winlog\"**: This field contains Windows Event Log (Winlog) data. It's a JSON object that provides more detailed information about the event, including the task performed (e.g., \"Process Create\").\n3. **\"file\"**: This field is usually empty or contains some basic information about a file related to the event.\n4. **\"cfev\"**: This is a base64-encoded string that appears to contain additional metadata about the event.\n\nThe logs seem to be related to security events, such as process creation and service startup. The \"powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" -BinaryPathName \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\\\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\"}\" command is a PowerShell script that creates and starts a new service named \"objeto_ativo\".\n\nTo analyze these logs, you would need to:\n\n1. Decode the base64-encoded field (\"cfev\") to extract any additional metadata.\n2. Review the Winlog data for each event (in the \"winlog\" field) to understand what type of security event occurred.\n3. Investigate the processes mentioned in the logs to determine if they are legitimate or malicious.\n\nWithout more context, it's difficult to provide a specific recommendation on how to proceed with analysis. If you have access to the system generating these logs and would like to discuss further, I can try to assist you with your specific questions."}
