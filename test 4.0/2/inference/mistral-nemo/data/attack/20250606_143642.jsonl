However, further investigation is needed to confirm if a threat is present.\n\nHere are some steps you can take next:\n\n- Check for any anomalous files in the `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory.\n- Monitor running processes and their behavior for any unusual activity.\n- Review the security logs for any related events, such as file or network access attempts.\n- Consider running a full system scan with up-to-date antivirus software."}
