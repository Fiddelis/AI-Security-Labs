{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided log data, here's a breakdown of events happening in sequence:\n\n1. **Process Create:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` is created.\n   - Task: Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\n   - No file event associated.\n\n2. **File Created:**\n   - `.winlogbeat.yml.new` is created in the directory `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data`.\n   - Task: File created (rule: FileCreate)\n   - Associated process: winlogbeat.exe\n\n3. **Image Loaded:**\n   - `urlmon.dll` is loaded into `smartscreen.exe`.\n   - Task: Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\n   - Associated process: smartscreen.exe\n\n4. **User Account Management:**\n   - No specific details provided.\n   - Task: User Account Management\n   - No associated file or process.\n\n5. **Image Loaded:**\n   - `taskschd.dll` is loaded into `taskhostw.exe`.\n   - Task: Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\n   - Associated process: taskhostw.exe\n\n6. **None:**\n   - No specific task identified.\n   - No associated file or process.\n\n7. **File Created:** (Similar to event 2)\n   - `.winlogbeat.yml.new` is created again in the same directory.\n   - Task: File created (rule: FileCreate)\n   - Associated process: winlogbeat.exe\n\nFrom these events, it seems that `winlogbeat.exe`, a tool for shipping logs from Windows to Elasticsearch or Logstash, was started and created a new configuration file. Afterwards, some system processes (`smartscreen.exe` and `taskhostw.exe`) loaded necessary DLL files, and there were user account management activities happening simultaneously. The repetition of the File Created event might suggest an issue with winlogbeat's configuration or operation."}
