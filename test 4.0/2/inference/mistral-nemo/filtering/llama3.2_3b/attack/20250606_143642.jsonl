If you have any specific questions or need to extract certain information from this JSON, please let me know.\n\n2. **System Logs (winlogbeat)**:\n   - There's an event with ID `103` which corresponds to the `Process Create` rule in Winlogbeat.\n   - The process that was created has a command line of `\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe \/c start \"\"\"\"powershell.exe\" -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp5676.ps1\"`. This suggests that a PowerShell script (`tmp5676.ps1`) located in the temp folder was run using cmd.exe with bypass execution policy.\n   - If you're investigating a security incident, this could indicate a potential threat as scripts running with bypass execution policy can execute arbitrary code.\n\nIf you'd like to know more about how to interpret these logs or need help with any specific analysis tasks, please provide further details or context."}
