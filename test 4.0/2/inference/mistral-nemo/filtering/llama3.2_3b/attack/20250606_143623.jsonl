{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The given data appears to be a series of JSON objects representing various system events such as process creation and Windows event logs. Let's break down each object:\n\n1. **Process Creation:**\n   - `command_line`: This field contains the command line used to create or start a service.\n     ```\n     'powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}'\n     ```\n   This command creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with the binary path set to the location of \"tarefa_logico.exe\", and then starts this newly created service.\n\n2. **Windows Event Logs:**\n   - `task`: This field indicates the type of Windows event log recorded.\n     ```\n     {'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\n     ```\n     or\n     ```\n     {'task': 'Provider Lifecycle'}\n     ```\n   The first task, \"Process Create\", signifies that a new process has been created on the system, and it was recorded according to the \"ProcessCreate\" rule. The second task, \"Provider Lifecycle\", indicates a change in the lifecycle of an event provider.\n\n3. **File and Process Information:**\n   - `process`: This field contains detailed information about the process being created or modified.\n     ```\n     {'command_line': 'powershell.exe & {New-Service ...'}\n     ```\n   In this case, the process is creating a new Windows service using PowerShell with the command line provided.\n\n4. **None Value:**\n   - `process`, `winlog`, and `file`: These fields can contain the value \"None\" when no relevant data was recorded or available for that particular event.\n\nBased on the repeated events, it appears that there is an attempt to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" using PowerShell in a loop or repeatedly. This could potentially indicate suspicious activity, such as an attempt to create multiple instances of a service or possibly an error occurring during service creation.\n\nTo further investigate this behavior, you may want to look into the following:\n\n- Check if there are any additional events related to the \"objeto_ativo\" service or PowerShell execution.\n- Inspect the \"tarefa_logico.exe\" file to determine its purpose and whether it's a legitimate part of your system or a potential threat.\n- Monitor for any unexpected changes in system configuration or performance that might be caused by this repeated service creation attempt."}
