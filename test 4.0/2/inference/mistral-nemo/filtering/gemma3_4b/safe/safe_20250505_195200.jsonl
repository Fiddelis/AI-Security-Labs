{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"**Analysis:**\n\nAll the events recorded are file creations by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". This process is creating multiple instances of two files: \"officeaicopilot-strings.min.<hash>.js\" and \"word-copilot.min.<hash>.js\", where \"<hash>\" represents a unique hash value.\n\n**Justification:**\n\n* **Threat Level:** Medium to High\n  - The creation of multiple instances of the same file type could indicate an attempt to evade security measures or a malware infection.\n- **Legitimate Source:** Unlikely, as legitimate software typically doesn't create many instances of the same file type repeatedly unless there's a significant change in configuration or update.\n- **Potential Malicious Activity:** The files created could be used for code injection, data theft, or other malicious activities. The repetition of the action might suggest an attempt to evade detection by security software.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n1. Investigate the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" and its relation to the affected files.\n2. Check if there are any known malware associations with this process or file creation pattern.\n3. Review system logs for other unusual activities around the same time period.\n4. Isolate the affected system(s) and perform a full system scan using updated antivirus software.\n5. If malicious activity is confirmed, remove or quarantine the infected files and process(es), then repair or restore the system from a known clean backup.\n\n**Confidence Level:** High - The repetitive nature of file creation by the same process is unusual and indicative of potential malicious activity."}
