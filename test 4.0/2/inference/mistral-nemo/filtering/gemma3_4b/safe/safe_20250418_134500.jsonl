Here are some key details:\n     - `commandLine`: `\"C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe\" \/k,\/t,http:\/\/www.example.com\/page?query=test&sort=date&order=desc`\n       - This indicates that the process was launched from Internet Explorer and it was instructed to open a specific webpage with certain parameters.\n     - `arguments`: `\"C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe\" \/k,\/t,http:\/\/www.example.com\/page?query=test&sort=date&order=desc`\n       - The `\/k` switch tells IE to close itself after the specified webpage is opened.\n       - The `\/t` switch tells IE to open the webpage in a new tab.\n\n2. **Process Access (Rule: ProcessAccess)**\n   - The \"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\" process accessed another process, but no further details are provided about which process was accessed or what type of access occurred.\n\n3. **Image Load (Rule: ImageLoad)**\n   - The \"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\" process loaded an image, presumably a DLL file. No specific details about the image loaded are provided in this event.\n\nThese events suggest that Internet Explorer launched Microsoft Edge Update with specific webpage parameters and then proceeded to interact with other processes or resources on the system. However, without additional context or further events, it's challenging to determine the exact purpose or outcome of these interactions."}
