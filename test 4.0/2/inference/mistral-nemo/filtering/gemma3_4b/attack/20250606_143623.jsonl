No further details provided.\n   - **Image loaded**: Shows the loading of a DLL file by a service host process (`svchost.exe`). This is normal behavior as `taskschd.dll` is required for Task Scheduler service.\n   - **Windows Update Agent**: No further details provided.\n   - **Provider Lifecycle & Engine Lifecycle**: These are related to the internal operation of Microsoft Defender (formerly Windows Defender) or other security software. They don't indicate any malicious activities in this context.\n\n3. **PowerShell commands:**\n   - The repeated `powershell.exe` instances with similar command lines suggest a script is running that creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and starts it. The service's binary path points to a file named `tarefa_logico.exe`, which is located at `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin`.\n   - The final `powershell.exe` instance writes a host message with the text \"Final result: 1\", indicating that whatever script was running has completed and resulted in success (1).\n\n4. **Potential implications:**\n   - While most events are normal or expected, the repeated creation of a new service (`objeto_ativo`) by a PowerShell script and the starting of this service could indicate a malicious activity.\n   - The location of `tarefa_logico.exe` in an uncommon directory (not typical for Windows system files) raises suspicion.\n   - To determine if this is indeed malicious, further investigation into the `tarefa_logico.exe` file's properties and behavior would be needed. This could involve checking its digital signature, running it in a sandbox environment, or analyzing its network communication patterns.\n\nIn conclusion, these logs indicate potential suspicious activity involving PowerShell creating and starting a new service that points to an executable located in an unusual directory. Further investigation is recommended."}
