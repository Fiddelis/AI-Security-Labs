Initially, there are several connections detected from chrome.exe which could indicate data exfiltration. Following this, powershell.exe is seen accessing processes and setting registry values, which are common techniques for malware communication and persistence. Also, sc.exe is used to create a service pointing to an executable in an unusual location (C:\\\\pacote_auxiliar). Moreover, multiple unknown executables are loading legitimate DLLs which could be a sign of masquerading malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
