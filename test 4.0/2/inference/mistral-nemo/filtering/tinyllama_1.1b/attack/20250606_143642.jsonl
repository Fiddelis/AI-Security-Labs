{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's what happened in sequence:\n\n1. A PowerShell script was executed from an unknown location (`None`), with the following command line:\n   ```\n   powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command .\\Get-DefaultInstall.ps1\n   ```\n2. The script `Get-DefaultInstall.ps1` was loaded and executed by `powershell.exe`.\n3. The script accessed the registry to set a value (`Registry value set`), likely for policy configuration.\n4. It then attempted to access other processes (`Process accessed`) and loaded various DLL files into its memory space (`Image loaded`), including:\n   - `mscoree.dll`\n   - `mscoreei.dll`\n   - `mscorlib.ni.dll`\n   - `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`\n5. The script then deleted itself from the temporary folder where it was running (`File Delete logged`):\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1\n   ```\n6. After deleting the script, `powershell.exe` continued to run, but no further significant events were logged (`None`). The process eventually terminated.\n7. Finally, two additional PowerShell processes were started with the following command lines (likely due to the script's logic or cleanup tasks):\n   - `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`\n   - `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\\\inf\\\\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\\\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\\\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;`\n\nThese final command lines suggest that the script was checking for the presence of `.inf` files in the Windows directory and printing the final result (either `1` or the actual result based on the check)."}
