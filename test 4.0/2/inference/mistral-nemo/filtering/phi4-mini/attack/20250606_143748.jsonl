{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's what happened:\n\n1. **System Startup**: Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` were started with the `-noP` and `-noprofile` switches, indicating a non-interactive PowerShell session. The command line also includes `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`, which allows running scripts even if they're not digitally signed or are from remote locations.\n\n2. **Script Download**: The PowerShell script `WinPwn.ps1` was downloaded from GitHub using the `iex` (Invoke-Expression) cmdlet with a `new-object net.webclient` for downloading the file from `<https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/>` URL.\n\n3. **Script Execution**: The script `WinPwn.ps1` was executed with two parameters: `-noninteractive` and `-consoleoutput`. The `-noninteractive` switch makes the script run without user interaction, while `-consoleoutput` sends output to the console instead of hosting it in a window.\n\n4. **Script Actions**: Since `WinPwn.ps1` is not publicly available, its exact actions are unknown. However, considering its name and typical functions of PowerShell scripts like this one, it might be performing actions such as:\n   - Enumerating and\/or manipulating system files.\n   - Running other scripts or commands.\n   - Attempting to hide or mask its activity.\n\nThe repeated `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` events suggest that these sessions were started, run the script, and then closed repeatedly. This might indicate an attempt at automated or stealthy operation.\n\n**Potential Threat**: Given the nature of the commands used, this activity could potentially be indicative of a threat actor conducting malicious activities on the system or network."}
