These typically indicate the startup or shutdown of Windows services (Provider Lifecycle) and internal engine activities in software like security tools or system monitoring systems (Engine Lifecycle).\n\n4. **PowerShell Commands:**\n   - Several PowerShell commands were executed:\n     ```\n     powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n     powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1'\n     ```\n   - The first command was used to create and start a service, as mentioned earlier.\n   - The second command seems to be logging the final result of an operation with `Write-Host`.\n\nGiven the context and the repeated attempts at creating and starting the service, it's possible that this is part of an automated process or script that's running on the system. However, without more information about the files and processes involved (`tarefa_logico.exe` in particular), it's difficult to determine if these activities are benign or indicative of a security threat.\n\nTo investigate further, you might want to:\n- Check if `tarefa_logico.exe` is a legitimate process or malware.\n- Review the contents of the folders where `tarefa_logico.exe` and its related files reside (`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin`).\n- Monitor for any suspicious activities or changes to the system after these events."}
