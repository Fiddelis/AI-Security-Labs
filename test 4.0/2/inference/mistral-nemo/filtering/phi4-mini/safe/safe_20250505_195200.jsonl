There are multiple instances of these files, each with a unique hash in the filename, suggesting they might be localized resource files.\n  - `vendors~event-link-plugin.js` and `vendors~copilotchatdisplay_*.js`: These files appear to be vendor-specific resources for event linking and copilot chat display features.\n\n**Interesting points:**\n- All events happened consecutively, with the first file created on '2023-05-16T14:38:57.922Z' and the last one on '2023-05-16T14:38:58.644Z', suggesting they were part of a single operation or sequence.\n- The sheer number of files created in such a short period (around 1 second) might indicate an update, installation, or initialization process for the Office applications.\n\n**Classification:**\nAs these events seem to be related to normal operation and potential updates\/installations of legitimate software (Microsoft Office), they would likely be classified as 'Informational' or 'Good' activity.

In this case, it's an .js file related to Excel Copilot Strings.\n\nGiven that all JSON objects share the same structure and have the same process name triggering the event (SDXHelper.exe), we can infer that these events are likely part of the same process or sequence. The only varying aspect is the filename at the end of the file path, suggesting that different files might be created each time this event occurs.\n\n**Classification:**\n\nBased on the information provided, these events could be classified as either:\n\n1. **Informational:** If creating these files is a normal, expected behavior of the SDXHelper process (e.g., updating resources or logs).\n2. **Potentially Suspicious\/Malicious:** If creating these files indicates some form of malicious activity (e.g., downloading and executing malicious code). However, without additional context or analysis, it's difficult to determine if that's the case here.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nTo better understand these events:\n\n- Check if the SDXHelper.exe process is a legitimate Microsoft process.\n- Verify if this behavior (creating files in that directory) is normal for this process.\n- Examine the contents of the created .js files, if possible and safe to do so.\n- Consult with an experienced analyst or use automated threat intelligence platforms for further analysis."}

The files being created are various minified JavaScript files (as indicated by '.min_' in their names) related to 'officeaicopilotstrings'.\n\n**Justification:**\n\nThis series of events does not appear malicious on its own. Here's why:\n\n1. **Legitimate Process:** 'SDXHelper.exe' is a known process associated with Microsoft Office, particularly with the 'Microsoft 365 Admin center' or other Office-related services.\n\n2. **Expected Files:** The creation of JavaScript files, especially minified ones ('.min_' indicates that they've been compressed for efficient loading), is common in software updates and feature deployments within Microsoft Office applications.\n\n3. **No Malicious Indicators:** There's no obvious indicator of malware or suspicious activity, such as:\n   - Unusual file paths (e.g., 'C:\\Windows\\System32', which is often associated with malware)\n   - Uncommon file extensions (like '.exe', '.bat', '.vbs' in unusual locations)\n   - Large number of files created in a short span (which could indicate an infection or ransomware attack)\n\n**Verdict:**\n\nThese events appear to be normal operations related to Microsoft Office application updates or feature deployments. However, without more context or deeper inspection, it's not possible to guarantee the benign nature of these events with absolute certainty.\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n\n- Monitor the system for any further unusual activity.\n- Keep an eye on CPU and memory usage to ensure they remain within normal limits.\n- Ensure all software is up-to-date and consider performing a full system scan using reliable antivirus software."}
