{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The provided data appears to be a series of JSON-formatted logs from a Windows environment, capturing various system events related to processes and file activities. Let's break down the information:\n\n### Process Events\n\n1. **Process Creation (`ProcessCreate` Rule)**\n   - `services.exe`: Created.\n   - `sppsvc.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`: Created with specific command lines in some instances (e.g., `whoami.exe` and a PowerShell execution that removes files).\n\n2. **Image Loading (`ImageLoad` Rule)**\n   - Several DLL files were loaded during the execution of `powershell.exe`, including:\n     - `taskschd.dll`\n     - `mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, `clr.dll`\n     - Native image DLLs for .NET (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll` and `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`)\n     - `MpOAV.dll` from Windows Defender\n\n3. **Process Access (`ProcessAccess` Rule)**\n   - `powershell.exe`: Accessed multiple times.\n\n4. **Registry Event (`RegistryEvent` Rule)**\n   - Registry value set events are recorded for `services.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `powershell.exe`.\n\n### File Events\n\n1. **File Creation (`FileCreate` Rule)**\n   - A PowerShell script file was created in the temporary directory:\n     - Path: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`\n\n2. **File Deletion Detected (`FileDeleteDetected` Rule)**\n   - The same PowerShell script file was subsequently deleted.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Potential Security Concerns:**\n  - **PowerShell Usage**: PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes due to its powerful scripting capabilities. Its execution, especially with commands that modify or delete files (e.g., removing `entrada_principal.zip`), should be closely monitored.\n  - **Registry Modifications**: Changes in the registry by processes like `services.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` can indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms employed by malware.\n  - **File Deletion**: The deletion of a file immediately after its creation might suggest an attempt to conceal actions, such as cleaning up traces of script execution.\n\n- **Windows Defender Involvement**: \n  - The loading of `MpOAV.dll`, part of Windows Defender's components, suggests that antivirus activities were happening during the observed period. This could indicate either routine scans or a response to detected threats.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Monitor PowerShell Activity**: Use tools and scripts to log detailed information about PowerShell commands executed on systems.\n2. **Audit Registry Changes**: Regularly review changes to critical registry keys, especially those related to services and system configurations.\n3. **Implement File Integrity Monitoring**: Track file creations and deletions in sensitive directories (e.g., `AppData\\Local\\Temp`) to detect unusual activities.\n4. **Review Antivirus Logs**: Analyze Windows Defender logs for signs of detected or blocked threats that correlate with these events.\n\nOverall, while the presence of these events can be part of normal operations, they warrant closer scrutiny due to their potential association with malicious activities."}
