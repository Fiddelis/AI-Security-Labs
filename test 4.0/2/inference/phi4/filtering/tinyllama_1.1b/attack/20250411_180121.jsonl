The frequent access to PowerShell and the creation of a file (`pacote_ativo.txt`) by it are notable indicators, especially in combination with other executable events such as `whoami.exe`, which could be involved in privilege escalation or information gathering. This pattern raises suspicion and warrants further investigation into the nature of these activities and their context within the environment. The confidence level is set at 0.85 to reflect a high probability of suspicious behavior, though not absolute certainty without additional context."}
