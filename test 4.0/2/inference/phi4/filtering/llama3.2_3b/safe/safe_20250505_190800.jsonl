There are multiple instances of PowerShell being used to create and execute scripts with elevated permissions (bypassing execution policy), along with the creation of temporary files, which could be indicative of a script-based attack or malware deployment. The use of PowerShell to load system DLLs and manage file operations in sensitive directories such as AppData and System32 is suspicious. Additionally, an event for executing a remote command was logged without specifying the initiating process, suggesting possible unauthorized remote access or control.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
