WMIC and cmd.exe are used to load suspicious DLLs (e.g., urlmon.dll, amsi.dll) that could be leveraged in bypassing security measures or executing further commands. Additionally, registry modifications by wmiprvse.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and RuntimeBroker.exe suggest tampering with system configurations. The usage of WMIC for creating processes without legitimate intent (e.g., notepad.exe creation via cmd.exe) is also suspicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
