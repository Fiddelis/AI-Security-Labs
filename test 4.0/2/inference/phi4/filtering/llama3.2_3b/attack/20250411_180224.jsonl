This indicates attempts to run potentially harmful scripts with elevated privileges (`system`). The repeated use of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` for script execution, combined with registry modifications via `chrome.exe`, further suggests possible persistence or privilege escalation activities. Additionally, the presence of file creation events related to `winlogbeat.exe` could imply attempts at log manipulation or monitoring.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
