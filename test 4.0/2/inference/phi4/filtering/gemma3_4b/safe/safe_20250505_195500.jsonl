Its unfamiliarity makes it suspicious.\n\n2. **Duplicate Events**: Several entries indicate the creation of identical files, which could suggest automation or tampering, often associated with malicious activities such as data duplication for exfiltration.\n\n3. **File Path Context**: The files are located in a directory related to Microsoft Office Solution Packages, specifically under `PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles`. This suggests that these files might be part of an extension or add-on, which could be leveraged by malware to disguise its activities.\n\n4. **Potential for Malicious Behavior**: Given the combination of unfamiliar process names, repetitive identical file creation events, and location within sensitive directories, there is a plausible risk of malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**: The confidence level is set at 0.85 due to strong indicators of suspicious activity, although further investigation (e.g., checking for known benign behaviors of `SDXHelper.exe`) would be necessary to confirm malicious intent definitively."}
