{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_185900.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving 'powershell.exe' including file creation, deletion, and process access events that may indicate script execution or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Analysis Explanation:\n\n- **Suspicious Use of PowerShell**: The logs show multiple `powershell.exe` activities related to loading images (dlls), creating files in temporary directories, and deleting those same files shortly after creation. This pattern is often associated with script execution or command-and-control activity.\n  \n- **File Creation & Deletion**: The rapid creation and deletion of a file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_juwnl41u.5gi.ps1`) in the `AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp` directory is particularly concerning as it may indicate attempts to run scripts temporarily, possibly avoiding detection.\n\n- **Process Access and Image Loading**: The process access events for `powershell.exe`, combined with image load events (e.g., `mscoreei.dll`, `clr.dll`, etc.), suggest dynamic loading or execution of additional code. This is a common technique in sophisticated attacks to execute malicious payloads.\n\n- **Use of Other Processes**: There is an event where `ipconfig.exe` is run, which might be benign but could be used for reconnaissance (e.g., gathering network configuration).\n\nOverall, the combination of these events forms a pattern that warrants further investigation due to its potential association with malicious behavior. The confidence level reflects the presence of multiple indicators pointing towards suspicious activity without definitive proof in this context alone."}
