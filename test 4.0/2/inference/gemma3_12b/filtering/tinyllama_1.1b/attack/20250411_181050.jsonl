This pattern suggests potential malicious code obfuscation and execution. The involvement of `powershell.exe` and frequent registry modifications further raises concerns. While chrome and winlogbeat are present, the `certutil` and `cmd.exe` sequence is the primary indicator of interest.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
