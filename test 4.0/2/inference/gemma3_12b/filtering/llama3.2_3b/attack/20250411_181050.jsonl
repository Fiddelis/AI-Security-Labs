This strongly suggests potential malicious activity, possibly involving obfuscation or a staged deployment of malware.  The use of `powershell.exe` and `rundll32.exe` alongside the `certutil` activity warrants further investigation. The presence of `SDXHelper.exe` combined with image loads of `combase.dll` and `urlmon.dll` is also a potentially concerning indicator.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
