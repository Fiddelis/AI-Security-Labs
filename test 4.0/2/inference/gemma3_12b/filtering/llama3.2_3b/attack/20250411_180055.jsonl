This behavior is frequently associated with data exfiltration or the creation of malicious archives.  The filenames are also suspicious, containing generic naming conventions like 'pacote_temporario,' 'objeto_comum,' etc., which might indicate automated or script-generated activities. The presence of `calc.exe` accessing `urlmon.dll` is also suspicious and warrants further investigation.
