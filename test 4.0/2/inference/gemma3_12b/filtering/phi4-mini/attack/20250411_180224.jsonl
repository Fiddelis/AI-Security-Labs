The scripts reference non-existent files (`c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`), which suggests an attempt to obfuscate the intended targets or possibly an error in the script creation. The creation of scheduled tasks with high privileges (system account) and the use of bypass are strong indicators of suspicious activity. Repeated registry modifications by `svchost.exe` also warrant investigation, as this could be related to the task execution or a larger malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
