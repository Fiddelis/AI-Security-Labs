The sheer volume of Chrome registry and network events, combined with the Google Updater's crash handler and attachment of a log file, warrants closer investigation to rule out malicious behavior or unusual system activity. Winlogbeat installation and configuration also needs to be verified.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a breakdown of the events logged, categorized and summarized.  This isn's a full security analysis, but provides a general overview of what's happening.\n\n**1. Microsoft Edge Update Activities**\n\n*   **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process creation:**  The Edge Update process is launched.\n*   **Image Loads:** Several images (DLLs, executables) are loaded into the Edge Update process, including `msedgeupdate.dll`.\n*   **Process Termination:**  The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process ends.  This is normal after the update process completes.\n*   **Edge Update Temporary File Deletion:**  `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` deleted a temporary Edge installer file from the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory.\n*   **Edge Update Installer Setup.exe:**  A setup.exe file seems to be executed from an Edge Installer folder. This is part of the Edge Update process.\n*   **Temporary File Creation:** Several temporary files were created during the installation process, visible in the path.\n\n**2. System Processes and Events**\n\n*   **RuntimeBroker.exe:**  The `RuntimeBroker.exe` process (important for Windows Store apps) performed a registry value set.\n*   **Notepad.exe:**  Notepad was launched manually.  (User interaction).\n*   **CompatTelRunner.exe:** The Compatibility Troubleshooting Runner performed a DNS query.\n*   **System File Creation:** System file creation, likely part of the Edge update process\n*   **Explorer.exe Registry Change:** The Windows Explorer process made changes to the registry.\n\n**3. Winlogbeat Activities (Log Collection Agent)**\n\n*   **Winlogbeat process creation:** The `winlogbeat.exe` process (your log collection agent) is running.\n*   **Log File Creation:** Winlogbeat created multiple log files related to its operation. These indicate its data gathering and configuration.\n*   **New Configuration:** It created a new configuration file `data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`.\n\n**4. Windows Update Activity**\n\n*   **WindowsUpdate.etl Files:** Several `WindowsUpdate.etl` files were created.  These indicate Windows Update logging.\n\n\n\n**Potential Areas for Further Investigation (not necessarily malicious, but worth noting):**\n\n*   **RuntimeBroker.exe Registry Change:** Investigate what specific registry key was modified and the reason.\n*   **CompatTelRunner.exe DNS Query:**  While expected behavior for compatibility checks, it's good to know what domain was queried.\n*   **File Creation Time Change:** A setup.exe file changed its creation time. While common in installations, could be a sign of tampering in very specific cases.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\nThis log set shows a routine Microsoft Edge update process in action. Also, normal system activity and the collection of logs using `winlogbeat` were observed."}
