These commands utilize the Compress-Archive cmdlet and have similar naming patterns (e.g., 'tarefa_geral', 'pacote_logico'). While compressing files isn't inherently malicious, the repeated nature of these commands and the structured directory names (suggesting a specific, possibly automated process) raise suspicion. The use of the Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive module also further underscores the automated nature.  Additionally, several events relate to pipeline execution, which can be an indicator of malicious activity. Although winlogbeat installation and other benign activities are present, the PowerShell compression commands are concerning enough to warrant investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
