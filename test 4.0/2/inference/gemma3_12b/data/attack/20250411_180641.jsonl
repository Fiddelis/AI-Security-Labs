Specifically, the repeated use of `csc.exe` (C# compiler) to create and execute `.exe` files from source code, combined with use of PowerShell and cmd.exe, and the creation of numerous executables in temporary directories, strongly suggests a potential code compilation and execution process, possibly to bypass security measures.
