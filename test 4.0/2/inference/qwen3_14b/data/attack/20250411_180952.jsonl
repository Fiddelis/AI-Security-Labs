{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe doing DNS queries and MpDefenderCoreService.exe having network connections. Those are normal for system processes. Chrome.exe doing DNS lookups and network connections is typical for a browser. But then there's a lot of powershell.exe and cmd.exe activities. \n\nWait, the cmd.exe entry has a command line that adds a user to the domain with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and adds them to the Domain Admins group. That's a red flag. Creating domain admin accounts is a big security risk. Also, there's another cmd.exe command adding another user to Domain Admins. \n\nThen there's net.exe and net1.exe commands adding users and groups. The use of net1.exe instead of net.exe might be suspicious because net1.exe isn't a standard Windows tool. That could be a sign of malicious activity, like a backdoor or tool used for lateral movement.\n\nAlso, the PowerShell processes accessing the registry and creating files. The file creation by winlogbeat.exe is normal, but the other PowerShell creating pacote_base.txt might be part of data exfiltration. \n\nMultiple events involving registry changes and process creation, especially with administrative privileges, could indicate an attacker trying to escalate privileges or modify system settings. The presence of multiple user additions to Domain Admins is a clear sign of potential compromise. \n\nSo putting it all together: creating domain admin accounts, using suspicious tools like net1.exe, and modifying the registry are all indicators of malicious activity. The confidence is high here, so the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a high confidence score.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin accounts via 'net' commands, use of non-standard 'net1.exe' tool, repeated registry modifications, and PowerShell activity. These indicate potential privilege escalation and lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these four events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each one.\n\nFirst event: svchost.exe created a file at C:\\Windows\\System32\\sru\\SRUtmp.log. Wait, SRUtmp.log is part of the System Resource Usage (SRU) system, which is used by Windows for tracking resource usage. The svchost.exe process is a legitimate system process. Creating this file might be normal, like during system updates or logging. But I should check if this is a common occurrence. Maybe it's just part of the system's normal operation, so not suspicious.\n\nSecond event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a tool used for collecting and shipping logs. The file path is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a temporary file during configuration. If the user is setting up winlogbeat, this could be normal. However, if it's not expected, maybe it's a sign of something else. But since the process is winlogbeat.exe, which is legitimate, this might be benign.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe set a registry value. PowerShell is a common tool, and modifying the registry isn't inherently bad. But without more context, like which registry key was changed, it's hard to tell. It could be part of a legitimate script or a malicious action. However, just a single registry value change might not be enough to flag it as suspicious.\n\nFourth event: powershell.exe accessed a process. The ProcessAccess rule might indicate that PowerShell is interacting with another process. Again, this is common in legitimate scenarios, like automating tasks. But if combined with other events, it could be part of a larger attack. However, on its own, it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at all events together: The first two events involve file creation by legitimate processes. The third and fourth involve PowerShell doing registry and process access. But none of these events show clear signs of malicious activity. No unusual file paths, no unexpected processes, and no obvious signs of privilege escalation or data exfiltration. The confidence is medium because while PowerShell activities can be risky, they're also common in normal operations. The other events don't seem suspicious. So maybe it's not interesting, but I should check if there's any combination that's concerning. For example, if PowerShell was modifying critical registry keys or accessing sensitive processes, but the data given is too limited. Therefore, the classification is likely NOT INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) performing normal operations (file creation, registry modification, process access) without indicators of compromise or suspicious patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
