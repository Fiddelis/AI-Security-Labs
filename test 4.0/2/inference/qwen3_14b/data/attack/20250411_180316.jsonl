{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and powershell.exe triggering registry value set events. Those are normal processes, and registry changes can be common, but not necessarily malicious. However, I should check for any unusual patterns.\n\nLooking further, there's an entry for calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate system file, but if it's being loaded by calc.exe, that might not be suspicious. But then there's another entry for Calculator.exe loading the same dll. Hmm, maybe that's just a normal process, but I need to check more.\n\nThen there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But the filename is .yml.new, which could be part of a normal setup. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a whoami.exe process, which is typically used to check user context. Not inherently malicious, but if it's part of a larger attack, it could be. However, alone, it's not a red flag.\n\nThen, a cmd.exe process running a command to delete notepad.exe processes using wmic. That's interesting. Deleting processes can be part of a cleanup phase. Also, the command line has \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". That's a bit suspicious because wmic is often used in attacks, and deleting processes might be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nThen, there's a WMIC.exe process creating a new process, and loading amsi.dll. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a malicious process is trying to load it, maybe to bypass detection, that could be a sign. But I need to see if there's any other context.\n\nAlso, multiple instances of powershell.exe and svchost.exe triggering registry events. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the combination of deleting processes and using wmic might indicate some malicious activity.\n\nAnother thing is that the same dll (urlmon.dll) is being loaded by different processes. While urlmon.dll is legitimate, if it's being loaded in unusual contexts, that might be a problem. However, in this case, it's being loaded by calc.exe and WMIC.exe, which might be normal.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious part is the cmd.exe command deleting notepad.exe processes via wmic. That's a behavior that could be part of a malware's cleanup phase. Also, the presence of multiple registry changes and process accesses could indicate an attempt to modify system settings or evade detection. However, there's not enough direct evidence like unexpected network activity, file modifications, or privilege escalation. But the combination of these events might be worth investigating further.\n\nSo, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7. The justification is the suspicious command in cmd.exe and the multiple registry changes, which could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events including process deletion via WMIC, registry modifications by non-system processes, and potential lateral movement indicators.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. The first one stands out: WMIC.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That path seems legitimate, but WMIC is often used in attacks. Then there's a lot of Registry value set events from chrome.exe, conhost.exe, cmd.exe, and powershell.exe. That's a lot of activity, but maybe normal? Wait, the command line in one of the cmd.exe events is copying sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. That's a classic attack technique to replace the Sticky Keys executable with a malicious one. Also, there's a schtasks command deleting a scheduled task named win32times. That could be part of cleaning up after an attack. The repeated registry changes and process creations might indicate someone trying to modify system settings or hide their tracks. Even though some processes like chrome and notepad are normal, the combination of these actions—especially the file copy and scheduled task deletion—raises suspicion.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, I should look through the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first entry: schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal because schtasks is a legitimate Windows tool for managing scheduled tasks, and taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler. No red flags there.\n\nThen there's svchost.exe and registry events. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, so registry changes might be normal. But I should check if there's anything unusual. The other entries involve cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe with various registry and process events. \n\nWait, there's a chrome.exe entry loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender. But why is chrome.exe loading these? Chrome shouldn't be loading Defender DLLs. That seems odd. Maybe an exploit or something trying to bypass detection? Also, the path for MpOAV.dll is in the ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender directory, which is legitimate, but the fact that chrome is loading it might be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being created and accessing processes. While PowerShell and CMD are common, frequent process creation and access might indicate someone trying to execute commands or scripts. However, without more context, like unusual commands or unexpected parent processes, it's hard to say. \n\nThe whoami.exe executions are normal, just checking the user. But combined with other events, maybe they're part of a larger attack. \n\nSo the main suspicious points are: chrome.exe loading Defender DLLs, which is unusual, and the high number of registry changes and process accesses. However, without more data, like network activity or specific commands, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut considering the classification needs to be either interesting or not. Since there's at least one event that's unusual (chrome loading amsi and MpOAV), and the rest are common but frequent, I think this might be worth investigating. The confidence might be around 0.6 because there's a potential anomaly but not enough to be certain. However, maybe the confidence should be higher because the chrome loading of those DLLs is a strong indicator. I need to check if that's a known issue. \n\nWait, maybe the DLLs are being loaded from unexpected places. Let me check the paths again. The amsi.dll is in C:\\Windows\\System32, which is correct. MpOAV.dll is in ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender, which is also legitimate. So maybe that's normal. But why is chrome.exe loading them? Maybe it's a false positive. Alternatively, maybe the process is being impersonated or there's a module loading attack. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the events are part of normal operations, like malware analysis tools or legitimate software. Without more context, it's hard to tell. But the presence of multiple registry changes and process accesses could indicate an attack. \n\nHmm. The justification should be concise. The presence of chrome.exe loading Defender DLLs and multiple registry changes might be suspicious. But if those are normal, then maybe not. I think the answer is \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.65 because of the unusual process loading, even if the paths are legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Unusual process behavior detected: chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll (Windows Defender components), combined with frequent registry modifications and process access events, which may indicate potential malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that there's a 'whoami.exe' process running, which is a legitimate Windows tool used to display the current user's identity. That alone isn't suspicious. But then there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' being executed. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to check the context.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe & {}' which seems like an empty command. That might be a red flag because sometimes attackers use empty commands to test if detection systems are triggered. Also, there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET Framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them isn't inherently bad. However, the presence of multiple such events could indicate that PowerShell is being used in a way that's interacting with these components, possibly for executing scripts or payloads.\n\nThen there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1'. The name suggests it's related to a script policy test, which might be part of a legitimate process, like testing execution policies. But the fact that the file is created and then deleted quickly could be an attempt to hide the presence of a script. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nAnother point is the 'Pipe Created' event for PowerShell. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but if there's a lot of them or in unexpected contexts, it might be a sign of something else.\n\nAlso, there are several 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with the same command. These might relate to the PowerShell engine initializing or shutting down, but repeated events could indicate some kind of probing or testing.\n\nHowever, I don't see any clear signs of malicious activity like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or suspicious network connections. The events seem to be related to normal operations, possibly including testing or legitimate administrative tasks. The presence of the .NET DLLs and the temporary file might be part of a script execution that's allowed, like a system administrator running a test.\n\nBut considering that the same command is repeated multiple times and the creation\/deletion of a script file, even if it's a test, it might be worth investigating further to confirm if it's part of a legitimate process or if there's an underlying issue. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there are enough anomalies to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with empty commands ('& {}') and frequent file creation\/deletion in temporary directories may indicate testing or obfuscation techniques.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a PowerShell process loading an image from the Windows Defender path. That's a legitimate file, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's a File created event in the user's AppData folder. Creating files there isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other events?\n\nNext, there are several Registry value set events and Process accessed events. The registry changes might be normal, but if they're modifying keys related to security or startup, that could be a red flag. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys, so it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there are multiple PowerShell processes running with command lines that check for the existence of certain batch files. The paths mentioned have some odd patterns, like using \"..\\\" which might be trying to traverse directories. But the batch files themselves aren't present in the logs, just the checks. The fact that so many PowerShell scripts are checking for these files could indicate an attempt to locate and execute them, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\nAlso, there are several Process Create events for PowerShell, which is common but could be part of a chain of commands. The Image loaded events for mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll are .NET components, which are normal for PowerShell, so that's probably okay.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated PowerShell activity, checking for specific batch files, and the file creation in user directories might be part of a larger attack.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: they all mention 'powershell.exe' loading various DLLs from Windows directories like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are all legitimate .NET Framework components. So that's normal, part of the system's operation. Then there's an entry about Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll being loaded. Also legitimate, as that's part of the antivirus.\n\nThen there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1. Creating and deleting a script in Temp might be normal, but sometimes attackers do that to hide their activities. However, since it's a .ps1 file, which is a PowerShell script, and it's in the Temp folder, maybe that's part of a test or a legitimate process. But the fact that it's created and then deleted could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother file created is 'elemento_padrao.txt' in the Downloads folder. That seems benign, just a text file. Not sure why it's mentioned here unless it's part of some activity.\n\nThen there are multiple registry events from chrome.exe. A lot of registry value sets. Chrome might be updating its settings, but so many entries in a short time could indicate something, but maybe not. The user hasn't specified a time frame, but the repetition might be a clue. However, Chrome does a lot of registry operations normally.\n\nThen there's a pipe created by powershell.exe. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, which can be normal, but sometimes abused by malware. However, without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the command lines: two instances of PowerShell scripts checking if certain paths exist and exiting with 0 or 1. These are test scripts, checking for the existence of files. Maybe part of a deployment or a script that's supposed to run only if certain files are present. Not inherently malicious, but could be part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother entry is a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That's a PowerShell-specific directory, so maybe it's related to user profiles or scripts that run at startup. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there are two registry value sets from PowerShell. Again, PowerShell interacting with the registry could be normal, but if it's modifying critical keys, that's a problem. However, the logs don't specify which keys, so I can't tell.\n\nPutting it all together: most of the events are related to normal operations of PowerShell and Chrome. The creation and deletion of a script in Temp might be suspicious, but it's not definitive. The multiple registry events from Chrome could be normal, but the repetition might be a sign of something. However, without more indicators of compromise (like unusual processes, network activity, or unexpected command-line arguments), it's hard to classify this as interesting. The presence of some legitimate activities mixed with what could be normal system behavior makes me think this might not be a security incident. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the confidence should be around 0.5, but since the user wants a classification, and there's no clear malicious activity, I'd lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** NOT INTERESTING  \n**Confidence:** Moderate (55%)  \n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe log entries primarily reflect normal system operations and benign user activities. Key observations:  \n\n1. **Legitimate DLL Loads:** PowerShell loading `.NET` Framework components (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`) and Windows Defender modules (e.g., `MpClient.dll`) is standard behavior.  \n\n2. **Temporary Script Creation\/Deletion:** The temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`) being created and deleted in the Temp directory is consistent with testing or automated processes (e.g., script validation). No malicious content or persistence mechanisms are evident.  \n\n3. **Chrome Registry Activity:** Multiple registry writes by Chrome are likely due to routine updates or configuration changes. No anomalous keys or values are indicated.  \n\n4. **Path-Checking Scripts:** The PowerShell scripts testing file existence (e.g., `Test-Path`) appear to be simple conditional checks, possibly for deployment or dependency verification. No harmful commands or payloads are present.  \n\n5. **Startup Profile File:** The creation of a file in `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` is typical for PowerShell profile initialization and does not suggest malicious intent.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the logs show routine system interactions and minor transient activities, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior, lateral movement, or exploitation. The observed actions align with standard operations of PowerShell, Chrome, and Windows Defender. Further investigation would require additional context (e.g., network traffic, process tree, or file content analysis).  \n\n**Recommendation:** No immediate action required. Monitor for unusual patterns in conjunction with other telemetry sources."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them involve PowerShell.exe with various winlog tasks. The first event shows a process create with a command line that uses New-Item and Set-Content to create and modify batch files. The paths here are a bit suspicious because they have '..\\' which might be trying to navigate directories, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. That's normal for PowerShell, as it uses the .NET framework. But then there's one that loads 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender. That's a bit odd because that's part of Microsoft Defender's antimalware platform. Why would PowerShell be loading that? Maybe it's a legitimate process, but maybe not.\n\nLooking at the command lines in the later events, they all follow a pattern: using New-Item to create a batch file in a certain path, then Set-Content to write \"dir\" into another batch file. The paths are all over the place, with different directories and names. This seems like automated script creation, possibly trying to execute commands or set up persistence.\n\nThe repetition of this pattern across multiple events suggests that this isn't a one-off occurrence. The use of '..\\' in the paths might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual location, but it's common in legitimate scripts too. However, the fact that multiple batch files are being created and modified in different locations could indicate an attempt to spread or execute malicious code.\n\nThe 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks might be related to event logging or something else, but combined with the other events, it's more about the PowerShell activities. The loading of Defender's DLL is a red flag. Usually, malware might try to disable or interact with antivirus components, but loading a Defender DLL directly might be a sign of something trying to mimic legitimate processes or evade detection.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated creation of batch files with PowerShell, along with loading specific DLLs, could be indicative of malicious activity. Even though some parts are normal for PowerShell, the combination and frequency here make it suspicious.

So first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a PowerShell command creating a file and setting its content to \"dir\". The path is a bit suspicious with the \"..\\\" which might be trying to navigate up directories. Then another file is created in a temporary directory, but then it's deleted. That's a common tactic to hide files. \n\nNext, there's a pipe created, which might be used for inter-process communication. Then another PowerShell command creating files in different paths again using \"..\\\". These paths seem to be trying to create files in parent directories, which could be a way to bypass some security measures.\n\nThen there are several image loads related to .NET assemblies. That's normal for PowerShell, but combined with the file creation and deletion, it might indicate something malicious. The registry value sets and process accesses could be part of modifying system settings or escalating privileges.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell to create and delete files, along with loading .NET DLLs, might be part of a script that's trying to execute malicious code. The fact that files are being created and then deleted could be an attempt to avoid detection. Also, the paths used have a pattern with \"..\\\" which might be trying to access parent directories to place files in unexpected locations.\n\nHowever, some of these events might be benign, like the Windows Defender DLLs being loaded. But the combination of multiple file operations, registry changes, and the use of PowerShell with suspicious paths increases the likelihood of malicious activity. \n\nI need to check if there's a pattern here. The user is using PowerShell to create files in various directories, possibly to execute scripts or drop payloads. The deletion of the temporary file might be to clean up traces. The multiple ImageLoad events for .NET components are typical for PowerShell, but when combined with the other actions, it's more suspicious.\n\nSo, considering all these events together, there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve PowerShell executing commands that check if certain batch files exist. The paths mentioned have a pattern: they start with a directory, then use \"..\\\" to go up a level, and then check another directory. For example, \"C:\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\elemento_padrao\\\\..\\\\registro_logico\\\\estrutura_principal_script.bat\". The \"..\\\\\" part is interesting because it might be trying to access parent directories, which could be a sign of path traversal attempts. But wait, in Windows, using \"..\\\" is normal for navigating up directories, so maybe that's not suspicious on its own.\n\nHowever, the fact that there are multiple such commands checking different paths might indicate that the attacker is probing the file system for specific files. The exit codes (0 or 1) based on the existence of these files could be part of a larger attack, like checking for the presence of certain scripts before executing them. But without more context, like actual execution of malicious scripts or unauthorized access, it's hard to say.\n\nThen, looking at other events: there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory, which is common for PowerShell scripts. The creation of a temporary script file and then deleting it might be part of a normal process, but if it's being done in a way that's evasive, that could be a red flag. However, the event also includes a FileDeleteDetected, which is just the system logging the deletion, not necessarily malicious.\n\nAnother event mentions a pipe created, which might be part of inter-process communication. Not inherently malicious, but could be used in attacks. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere are also entries about image loaded (like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll) which are part of Windows Defender. That's normal, so probably not an issue.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell processes doing various tasks (file creation, registry changes, etc.) might be normal user activity. However, the repetition of checking for specific batch files in different paths could be a pattern. Maybe the attacker is trying to find a specific script that's supposed to be present, and if it's not there, they exit. But why would they do that? Maybe they're checking for the presence of a backdoor or a payload.\n\nAnother thing to note: the paths mentioned in the Test-Path commands have a structure that seems to be using \"..\\\" to navigate. For example, \"modulo_secundario\\elemento_padrao\\..\\\" would go up to the parent of \"modulo_secundario\", which might be a way to access higher-level directories. If the attacker is trying to access directories they shouldn't, that's a problem. But again, without knowing the actual directory structure, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the confidence level, I need to assess how likely this is malicious. The events don't show direct malicious activity like downloading payloads, executing suspicious commands, or accessing sensitive files. They're mostly logging file existence checks, file creation\/deletion, and normal process activities. However, the repetitive checking of specific files might be a sign of probing, which could be part of an attack. But without more evidence, it's a low to medium risk.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the events are not overtly malicious, but there are some patterns that could be indicative of reconnaissance or setup. However, without additional context or more suspicious activities, it's not conclusive. Therefore, the batch might be interesting for further investigation but not immediately alarming.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of reconnaissance or probing behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Script Probing:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` with paths containing `..\\` (parent directory traversal). For example:\n     ```\n     C:\\modulo_secundario\\elemento_padrao\\..\\registro_logico\\estrutura_principal_script.bat\n     ```\n     - **Normal Behavior:** Parent directory traversal is common in file system operations.\n     - **Potential Concern:** Repeated checks for specific files (e.g., `estrutura_principal_script.bat`, `modulo_geral_script.bat`) could indicate **reconnaissance** to identify existing scripts or payloads on the system.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - A temporary script file is created and deleted:\n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\n     ```\n     - **Normal Behavior:** PowerShell often uses temporary files for scripting.\n     - **Potential Concern:** Ephemeral files could be used to evade detection, but this alone is not conclusive.\n\n3. **Legitimate System Components:**\n   - Events involving **Windows Defender** (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) are standard and not suspicious.\n\n4. **Other System Activity:**\n   - File creation by `winlogbeat.exe` (a log shipper) and registry\/process access events are typical in enterprise environments.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity:** **Low to Medium**  \n  - The events do not show direct exploitation (e.g., payload execution, lateral movement, or data exfiltration).\n  - The probing behavior could be part of **reconnaissance** (e.g., checking for existing scripts or misconfigurations), but no clear malicious intent is evident.\n\n- **Need for Further Investigation:**  \n  - Correlate the `Test-Path` commands with other logs to determine if the files being checked are legitimate or if they align with known malicious scripts.\n  - Monitor for follow-up actions (e.g., execution of the probed files, network activity, or privilege escalation).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **not immediately alarming** but warrant **further analysis** to rule out reconnaissance or setup phases of an attack. The repetitive file checks and ephemeral file usage are the most notable patterns, though they could also be part of legitimate workflows (e.g., script deployment or configuration checks). **No high-confidence malicious activity is detected in this batch.** \n\n**Confidence Level:** **Low** (not conclusive but worth monitoring)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is 'whoami.exe' being executed, which is normal for checking user context.

However, the presence of multiple image loads could be normal depending on the PowerShell version and the scripts being run.\n\nNow, considering the classification. The key points here are the repeated PowerShell checks for specific files. If these files are part of a legitimate application, it's not suspicious. But the fact that the paths are so specific and the names are not standard might be a red flag. Also, the use of multiple Test-Path commands could be a way to check for the presence of malicious files or to map the system's structure. However, without seeing actual malicious activity like file creation, network connections, or unauthorized access, it's hard to confirm. \n\nBut the logs don't show any clear malicious actions. The PowerShell commands are just checking for file existence, which could be part of a legitimate script. The confidence here is moderate because while the pattern is a bit suspicious, there's no direct evidence of an attack. So, I'd lean towards 'INTERESTING' but with a confidence around 0.6, as it's worth further investigation but not a clear-cut threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing commands that check for the existence of specific executable files in non-standard paths, which may indicate reconnaissance or probing for potential attack vectors.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. The first event mentions the loading of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1, and then immediately deleted. That seems suspicious. Why create and delete a script so quickly? Maybe trying to execute something temporarily without leaving traces.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event, but no file involved. Not sure about that yet. Then there are several PowerShell processes with command lines checking if certain executables exist. The paths mentioned like C:\\registro_principal\\registro_temporario\\registro_secundario\\bin\\componente_secundario.exe don't look standard. These might be custom or malicious paths. The scripts are exiting with 0 or 1 based on whether the files exist. Could be checking for the presence of other components.\n\nThen there's another image loaded event for MpClient.dll, which is also part of Windows Defender. Still legitimate, but maybe the fact that PowerShell is loading these DLLs is normal. However, combined with the other events, it's a bit odd.\n\nThere are multiple registry value set events and process accessed events. Registry changes could indicate configuration changes or attempts to modify system settings. The process accessed events might be about inter-process communication, but if it's frequent, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe whoami.exe and cmd.exe processes are standard, but the command lines are simple existence checks. However, the repetition of PowerShell events with similar patterns might indicate automated scripts or probes. The Temp files being created and deleted quickly could be part of an attempt to execute scripts without leaving evidence.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of creating and deleting temporary scripts, checking for the existence of files in non-standard paths, and multiple registry and process access events might indicate a probing phase. The attacker could be checking the environment, looking for vulnerabilities, or preparing for further actions. However, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack yet.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the processes, almost all of them are related to powershell.exe. There are a few instances of ProcessCreate, ProcessAccess, and ImageLoad events. The command lines for some of the PowerShell processes are checking if certain files exist. For example, they're using Test-Path to check for .cs files in various directories. These files seem to be part of some project structure, maybe related to software development. But why would that be suspicious?\n\nWell, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that there are multiple ProcessAccess events might indicate that the process is being accessed by other processes, which could be normal, but combined with other factors, it might be a red flag. \n\nThen there are the ImageLoad events. The logs show that PowerShell is loading several .dll files from the Windows directory, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET Framework, so loading them is normal when running .NET applications. However, if these files are being loaded from unexpected locations or if there's an unusual number of such events, that could be concerning. But in this case, the paths look legitimate.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repeated use of Test-Path in the command lines. This command checks if a file or directory exists. In a malicious context, this could be part of a script that's checking for the presence of certain files before proceeding with further actions. However, on its own, it's just a diagnostic command. \n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are entries for ProcessCreate, ProcessAccess, Registry value set, and ImageLoad. The Registry value set event might indicate that some registry keys are being modified. However, the event details don't specify which keys or what changes were made, so that's a bit unclear. \n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell processes and the various log entries might be part of a legitimate script that's running multiple checks. But the repetition and the number of events could also be indicative of something more. For example, if an attacker is using PowerShell to perform reconnaissance, checking for specific files or registry keys to determine the environment before deploying malware. \n\nHowever, without more context, like the presence of suspicious files, network activity, or other anomalies, it's hard to say for sure. The logs don't show any obvious signs of malware, like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, or modifying critical system files. The events are all related to process creation and file checks, which could be part of a normal application's behavior.\n\nBut the fact that there are so many PowerShell events and the repeated use of Test-Path might be worth investigating further. It's not a strong indicator of a security incident, but it's enough to flag the batch as interesting for a more detailed analysis. The confidence level is probably around 0.6 or 0.7 because while there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, the patterns are unusual enough to warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing Test-Path commands to check for specific .cs files across non-standard directories, combined with frequent ProcessAccess and ImageLoad events for .NET framework DLLs, suggests potential reconnaissance or automated script activity warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

Those are legitimate files, so maybe that's normal. But then there are other files in the Temp directory, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. The fact that a file is created and then immediately deleted might be suspicious. It could be part of a script that's trying to execute something temporarily and then clean up.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances where PowerShell is checking if certain files exist, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. The paths are all over the place, and some of them have similar names. The use of Test-Path and exiting with 0 or 1 might be part of a script that's checking for the presence of files, but why so many different paths? That could be a red flag. Also, the repetition of checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different directories might indicate an attempt to locate a specific script, possibly malicious.\n\nAnother thing is the use of the Temp directory for creating and deleting files. Attackers often use temporary directories to store malicious files temporarily to avoid detection. The fact that the file is created and then deleted could be an attempt to hide the presence of the script.\n\nHowever, some of the events are normal, like the Image loaded events for Windows Defender DLLs.

The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. First, I'll look through the events to see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several instances where PowerShell is checking if a file named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 exists in different directories. The command lines use Test-Path to check for the presence of this script. If the file exists, it exits with 0; otherwise, 1. That seems odd because why would someone check for a specific script multiple times in different paths?\n\nThen, there are events about image loading, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET. Those are normal for PowerShell, but maybe not suspicious on their own. However, there's also a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. Creating and deleting a temp file might be part of normal operations, but combined with other events, it could be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script name sounds like it could be related to keylogging, which is malicious. Even though the checks themselves aren't executing the script, the fact that the system is looking for such a script in multiple locations might indicate an attempt to locate or execute it. The presence of multiple checks across different directories (like C:\\registro_base, C:\\unidade_temporario, etc.) might suggest that the attacker is trying to find where the script is placed, possibly as part of a larger attack.\n\nAlso, there's a winlogbeat.exe event, which is a log shipper. The file creation here seems normal, but if there are other suspicious activities, it might be part of data exfiltration. However, the main focus here is on the PowerShell activities.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1, combined with the creation and deletion of a temp script file, might indicate that there's an attempt to run a malicious script.

First, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's common, but when combined with other events, it might be a red flag. There's a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a known place where malicious scripts might be stored, especially if it's being created by PowerShell.\n\nThen there are several ProcessAccess events for PowerShell, which could indicate someone trying to manipulate or access processes. Also, there's a whoami.exe execution, which is normal, but repeated PowerShell accesses might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe other events involve svchost.exe and chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. While svchost is a normal system process, multiple network connections might be part of exfiltrating data. However, chrome.exe doing a lot of network activity could be normal browsing, but combined with other suspicious events, it might be concerning.\n\nThe winlogbeat file creation seems legitimate, but the presence of multiple PowerShell events and the file in the Startup directory is more suspicious. I should check if there's any pattern of unauthorized access or unusual command-line arguments, but the data provided doesn't show that. However, the combination of file creation in a sensitive location and repeated process access could be indicative of an attack.\n\nSo, the classification is INTERESTING because there are multiple PowerShell activities and a file created in a directory that's often used for persistence.

So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, right? Browsers often do DNS lookups. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed a few times. Process access events are common, but maybe if it's too frequent? But here, it's multiple entries, but not sure yet. Also, there's a whoami.exe process created. That's a legitimate command, but maybe if it's used in a suspicious context?\n\nLooking further, there are several registry value set events by powershell. Changing registry values can be part of malware behavior, but again, depends on what's being changed. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys, so that's a bit vague.\n\nThen, image loaded events for various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. Those are part of the .NET framework, so normal. But there's also MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but maybe if it's being loaded in an unusual way? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That's common for scripts, but the file is a PowerShell script. The name is something like __PSScriptPolicyTest... which might be part of a script that's being run. However, creating and deleting a temp file isn't necessarily malicious, but combined with other events?\n\nAlso, there are multiple Provider Lifecycle events for PowerShell. Not sure what those exactly mean, but maybe related to event logging or something else. The command line is the same each time: ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, etc. That's just listing files recursively, which is a common command. But why so many entries? Maybe the script is running multiple times or being logged multiple times.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the multiple PowerShell processes, the registry changes, and the temp file. However, none of these events individually are clearly malicious. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a legitimate tool. The fact that there's a whoami.exe process (which is a normal command) and the temp file being created and deleted might be part of normal operations, like a script that's testing permissions or just listing files.\n\nBut wait, the command line in one of the events is \"powershell.exe & {ls -recurse\\nget-childitem -recurse\\ngci -recurse}\". That's just a PowerShell command to list files recursively. However, the repetition of multiple events with the same command line might indicate that the script is being run multiple times, which could be part of a larger operation. Also, the registry events and image loads might be part of a legitimate process, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thing: the file created in the Temp directory is deleted afterward. That's common for scripts to create temporary files, but if it's part of a larger attack, maybe. However, there's no evidence of malicious activity here, like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, or modifying critical system files.\n\nConsidering all that, the events don't show clear signs of a security incident. They might be part of normal user activity or a legitimate script. However, the high number of PowerShell events and registry changes could be a red flag. But without more context, like the user's typical behavior, it's hard to say. Maybe the confidence is medium, but not high enough to classify as interesting. Alternatively, since there's no clear malicious activity, it's probably not interesting. But I need to make sure I'm not missing something.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event logs do not indicate a clear security incident or malicious activity. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Normal System Activity:**\n   - **Chrome DNS Query:** Routine for browsing.\n   - **`whoami.exe`:** A standard Windows utility for checking user identity.\n   - **.NET DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`):** Part of legitimate .NET framework operations.\n   - **Windows Defender (`MpOAV.dll`):** Expected in a secure environment.\n\n2. **PowerShell Usage:**\n   - **Repetitive `ls -recurse`\/`get-childitem` Commands:** Common for file enumeration, often used in legitimate scripts or troubleshooting.\n   - **Temp File Creation\/Deletion:** Typical for temporary script execution (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest...`).\n\n3. **Registry and Process Events:**\n   - **Registry Modifications:** Not explicitly malicious, but the lack of context (e.g., specific keys modified) makes it hard to assess.\n   - **Provider Lifecycle Events:** Likely related to PowerShell logging or event tracking, not inherently suspicious.\n\n### **Lack of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- No evidence of:\n  - Unusual network connections.\n  - File downloads or exfiltration.\n  - Unauthorized user activity.\n  - Malware signatures or anomalous processes.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the high frequency of PowerShell events and registry changes could warrant further investigation in a real-world scenario, **these logs alone do not constitute a clear security threat**. They appear to reflect normal system operations or benign scripting activity. \n\n**Classification:** **Not Interesting** (No actionable threat detected).  \n**Confidence:** Medium (Lack of context limits definitive judgment, but no malicious behavior is evident)."}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple PowerShell processes running commands like 'ls -recurse', 'get-childitem -recurse', and 'gci -recurse'. These commands are all about recursively listing files and directories. That's a common legitimate activity, but sometimes attackers use similar commands to search for sensitive files. However, just running these commands isn't necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nThen there's an entry about 'MpClient.dll' being loaded. That's part of Windows Defender, so that seems normal. No signs of tampering here. Next, there's a 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so if it's creating configuration files, that's part of its normal operation. But the file name is '.winlogbeat.yml.new' which might be a temporary file during setup. Not suspicious yet.\n\nAnother PowerShell process creates a file named 'estrutura_secundario.txt'. Not sure what that is, but without more context, it's hard to tell. There are also registry events where PowerShell and conhost.exe are setting registry values. Changing registry settings can be part of both legitimate and malicious activities. However, just setting a registry value isn't enough to flag it as malicious.\n\nLooking at the tasks in winlog: 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Engine Lifecycle', 'Image loaded', 'File created', 'Registry value set', 'Process accessed'. These are all standard events that Windows logs. The repetition of PowerShell commands and file creations might be part of normal user activities, like setting up tools or scripts.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events. There's no evidence of unusual process behavior, network activity, or privilege escalation.
