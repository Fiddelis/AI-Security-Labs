{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe accessed. Then whoami.exe is created. That's a common command to check user privileges, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then more powershell.exe accesses. Then a registry value set event. Hmm, but then there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that's trying to create a service called win32times, pointing to a script that doesn't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1). That looks suspicious because creating a service with a non-existent script might be an attempt to execute malicious code later.\n\nNext, sc.exe is used to create the service again, and then qc to query the service. The command line for sc.exe is trying to set the binary path to another non-existent script. That's a red flag. Services are often used by malware to persist, so creating a service with a non-existent path could be a sign of an attack.\n\nThen there are multiple registry value set events involving services.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, notepad.exe, etc. But many of these might be normal system processes. However, the repeated registry changes could indicate something trying to modify system settings. Also, the image load events for urlmon.dll in calc.exe and Calculator.exe. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but if it's being loaded by a process like calc.exe, that might be normal. But if it's being used in an unexpected way, maybe that's a problem. However, the paths here are the standard System32 location, so it's probably legitimate.\n\nBut the main issue here is the creation of a service with a non-existent script. The attacker might be trying to set up a backdoor that's not yet active, or they might have a typo in the script name. Also, the use of sc.exe to create the service is a common technique in malware. The fact that the script paths don't exist could mean that the attacker is trying to create a service that will execute a payload later, or maybe they made a mistake. Either way, it's suspicious.\n\nThere are also multiple powershell.exe accesses, which are often used in attacks. However, without more context like command-line arguments or network activity, it's hard to tell. But combined with the service creation, it's more concerning.\n\nThe other events involve registry changes and image loads, but the most suspicious parts are the service creation attempts with non-existent scripts and the repeated use of sc.exe and cmd.exe. So overall, this batch seems to have indicators of potentially malicious activity, especially the service creation with non-existent paths. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Creation of a service (win32times) with a non-existent script path (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1), which may indicate attempted persistence or payload execution. 2) Repeated use of sc.exe and cmd.exe to manipulate services, which is a common technique in malware. 3) Frequent registry modifications by system processes, which could signal configuration changes or evasion attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal, maybe part of an installation or configuration. Then there are several entries about ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe modifying registry values. Also, chrome.exe is involved in multiple registry changes and loading some DLLs.\n\nHmm, the first event might be benign, but the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe and powershell could be suspicious. However, chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are legitimate system files. Those are part of Windows Defender, so that's probably normal. The other registry modifications might be part of normal operations, like updates or configuration changes. But why so many entries from chrome.exe? Maybe a browser extension or a malicious script? But without more context, like unusual registry keys or unexpected processes, it's hard to tell. The presence of winlogbeat is normal for log collection. The other processes like Calculator and ApplicationFrameHost are typical. I don't see any clear signs of malware here. Maybe just normal system activity. So, probably not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include normal system activities such as file creation by winlogbeat.exe (log collection tool), registry modifications by legitimate processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe), and loading of legitimate system DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll). No clear indicators of compromise or suspicious patterns are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
