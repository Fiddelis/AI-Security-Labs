{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. But then I see several entries related to powershell.exe. \n\nLooking closer, there's a process creation event where powershell.exe is starting a script located at \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\\". Wait, the path has \"..\\\" which might be a directory traversal attempt. But I need to check if that's actually malicious or just a normal relative path. However, the next part of the path is \"pacote_secundario\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\". Hmm, the names here are a bit generic, but not necessarily suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there are multiple image load events for powershell.exe, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard .NET components, so that's normal. But then there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of a script's normal operation, but sometimes attackers do this to hide their activities. However, the file is named something like __PSScriptPolicyTest..., which sounds like a legitimate temporary file from PowerShell's own operations. \n\nThere are also several Pipe Created events, which might be part of inter-process communication, but again, not inherently malicious. The command lines show that PowerShell is being used to start various batch files. The paths here are a bit odd with the \"..\\\" parts, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nNow, considering that PowerShell is often used in attacks for executing commands, but the events here don't show any obvious malicious commands. The user might be concerned if these scripts are doing something like downloading files, executing remote commands, or modifying system settings. However, the logs provided don't include such activities. \n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell events could be normal if the user is running legitimate scripts. However, the combination of process creation, file creation\/deletion, and image loading might be worth investigating. But since there's no evidence of malicious activity like connecting to suspicious IPs, executing payloads, or modifying critical system files, it's a bit hard to classify this as definitely interesting. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit low because while there are a lot of PowerShell events, they don't show clear signs of malicious intent. Maybe the user is running some automated tasks or scripts that are legitimate. Without more context or indicators of compromise, it's safer to say this is not interesting, but with a moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal browser activity (chrome.exe DNS queries) and standard PowerShell operations (script execution, temporary file creation\/deletion, .NET DLL loading). No malicious indicators like suspicious network destinations, unauthorized access, or anomalous process behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I should look through all the events to see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of PowerShell being used with Start-Process commands. The command lines have paths that include \"..\\\" which is a directory traversal. That might be a red flag because it could indicate an attempt to access files outside the intended directory. For example, the first entry has \"C:\\\\objeto_padrao\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\..\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\entrada_base_script.bat\". The \"..\\\\\" here might be trying to go up a directory and then back down, which could be a way to obfuscate the actual path or access files that shouldn't be accessible.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that some of the paths in the Start-Process commands have repetitive directory structures, like \"estrutura_base\\\\objeto_principal\\\\..\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\\". This repetition might be an attempt to confuse analysis tools or make the path harder to track. Also, the filenames like \"modulo_principal_script.bat\" and \"componente_padrao_script.bat\" sound like they could be custom scripts, which might not be standard.\n\nThen there are events related to registry value sets and image loads. The image load for \"MpClient.dll\" from Windows Defender is normal, but the fact that PowerShell is loading that might not be suspicious. However, the other image load for \"urlmon.dll\" is part of Windows, so that's probably okay too.\n\nThe other processes like Chrome and Calculator are normal, but there are a lot of registry events. However, the key points here are the PowerShell commands with the suspicious paths. The use of \"..\\\" in multiple instances suggests possible malicious intent, such as trying to execute scripts from unexpected locations or bypassing security measures.\n\nI should also check if there's any pattern in the file paths. The paths seem to be structured with a lot of directories, which might be an attempt to hide the actual location. The repetition of certain directory names might be a way to make the path look more complex.\n\nAdditionally, there's a FileCreate event where PowerShell created a file in the user's AppData directory. That could be part of normal operations, but combined with the other PowerShell activities, it might indicate something more. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nConsidering all these points, the presence of multiple PowerShell commands with directory traversal in their paths is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these PowerShell commands with suspicious paths makes the batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because it's possible that these are legitimate scripts, but the patterns are concerning enough to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands with suspicious directory traversal patterns (e.g., '..\\\\') in file paths, which may indicate obfuscation or attempts to access unintended locations. This behavior is commonly associated with malicious activities such as script-based attacks or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's cmd.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. The winlog events are mostly Registry value set, Image loaded, and File created. \n\nNow, chrome.exe appears multiple times with Registry value set events. That's a lot. But is that normal? Chrome might modify the registry for its own settings, but so many times? Maybe not. Also, there's an Image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process like chrome.exe is loading these DLLs, that might be okay. But sometimes malware can hook into these DLLs. However, the paths here seem legitimate: C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll and the Defender path. So maybe that's normal.\n\nThen there are File created events. One is svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization directory. That seems normal for Windows Update or optimization processes. The other is powershell.exe creating files in the Downloads folder, which might be user-initiated. But the filenames are \"componente_principal.txt\" and \"elemento_base.txt\" â€“ those don't look suspicious. Also, winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file could be part of its setup.\n\nBut wait, the majority of the events are related to chrome.exe modifying the registry. If this is a legitimate user's Chrome, maybe they're doing something that causes many registry changes. However, in a security context, excessive registry modifications by a browser could indicate something like a browser hijacker or malware that's changing settings. Also, the fact that there are multiple registry events from chrome.exe might be a red flag. But I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity.\n\nThe other events don't seem too bad. The file creations are in expected locations. The ImageLoad events are for legitimate DLLs. The only possible concern is the numerous Registry value set events from chrome.exe. But without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. However, the presence of multiple registry changes by a single process could be indicative of malicious activity, especially if it's not typical for that process.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation. The high number of registry changes by chrome.exe is suspicious, even if other events are normal. The confidence is around 0.65 because there's some suspicious activity but not definitive proof of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events by chrome.exe (11 instances) combined with legitimate DLL loads (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) and file creation activities in user directories may indicate either benign user behavior or potential registry manipulation attempts. The volume of registry changes by a browser process warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
