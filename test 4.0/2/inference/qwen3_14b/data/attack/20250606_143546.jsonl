That's common, but not always a red flag. Then there's a 'whoami.exe' process created, which is a standard command to check user privileges. Still normal.\n\nLooking deeper, one of the powershell.exe entries has a command line that imports a module from a path that seems a bit odd. The path includes '..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1' which might be a relative path trick. Also, the command line has some obfuscation with escaped quotes and backslashes. That's a red flag because attackers often obfuscate commands to avoid detection.\n\nThen, there are several 'Image loaded' events for various DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, and svchost.exe are all setting registry values. That's a common activity, but HxTsr.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Maybe that's a red flag? I should note that.\n\nThen there's sppsvc.exe creating a file in the Windows System32\\spp\\store\\2.0\\cache directory. The file is cache.dat. That seems normal for software protection service, but I need to check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nNext, powershell.exe is creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for legitimate scripts, but sometimes malware also uses this location. However, just creating a startup profile file might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, several processes are loading urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll. These are legitimate system files, so loading them isn't inherently bad. However, if they're being loaded from unexpected locations or by unusual processes, that could be a problem. But in the logs provided, the paths are standard System32 locations.\n\nThen there's a bunch of svchost.exe creating multiple files in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory. The Metadata folder here usually contains files related to Windows updates. The files listed like UpdateAgent.dll, dpx.dll, etc., are part of the Windows Update process. However, svchost.exe is a normal host process for Windows services, so this might be part of a legitimate update. But why so many files being created? Maybe the system is downloading a lot of updates, which is normal during an update cycle.\n\nBut wait, the HxTsr.exe process is still a concern. I should check if that's a known malicious process. A quick recall: HxTsr.exe isn't a standard Windows process. It might be associated with malware or adware. If that's the case, then having that process set registry values could be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the combination of registry changes and file creations by svchost.exe and other processes might indicate some kind of system modification. However, svchost.exe is often used by legitimate services, so without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is the presence of multiple FileCreate events in the SoftwareDistribution folder. That's typically where Windows Update stores downloaded updates. So if the system is in the middle of an update, this is normal. But if there's an unusual number of files or unexpected files, that could be a sign of something else.\n\nThe PowerShell event creating a StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file might be part of a user's normal activity, but if there are other PowerShell events that are more suspicious, that could be a factor. However, in the given logs, it's just one event.\n\nPutting it all together: The main red flags are HxTsr.exe performing registry changes and the multiple file creations in the SoftwareDistribution directory. However, without more context, like the presence of other malicious activities or the system's state, it's a bit ambiguous. But since HxTsr.exe is not a standard process, that alone might warrant further investigation. The rest of the events could be part of normal system operations like updates. So the answer is likely that this is interesting due to the HxTsr.exe activity, but further analysis is needed.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activities and potential indicators of interest. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Unusual Process Activity:**\n   - **`HxTsr.exe`** is not a standard Windows process. Its presence setting registry values (e.g., `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer`) raises suspicion. This could indicate **malware or adware** attempting to modify system behavior.\n\n2. **Legitimate System Processes:**\n   - **`svchost.exe`** and **`sppsvc.exe`** are standard Windows processes involved in system services and software protection. Their file creation activities (e.g., in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\spp\\store\\2.0\\cache`) align with **normal update\/activation processes**.\n   - **`powershell.exe`** creating a file in `AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup` is common for user-initiated scripts but could be **exploited by malware** if not explicitly authorized.\n\n3. **Image Load Events:**\n   - Multiple processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `backgroundTaskHost.exe`) loading **`urlmon.dll`** and **`BitsProxy.dll`** (legitimate system components) is typical for tasks like downloading updates or handling web requests.\n\n4. **Windows Update-Related Activity:**\n   - **`svchost.exe`** creating numerous files in `C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\MetaData` (e.g., `UpdateAgent.dll`, `TurboStack.dll`) suggests **Windows Update operations**. This is normal during an update cycle but warrants verification if the system is not actively updating.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **`HxTsr.exe`** is a **red flag** due to its non-standard nature and registry modifications. It could be **malware** attempting to persist or alter system settings.\n- The **volume of file creation** in `SoftwareDistribution` might indicate **aggressive update activity**, but this alone is not suspicious without additional context (e.g., unexpected update sources).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis log entry is **interesting for investigation** due to the presence of **`HxTsr.exe`** and the **unusual registry modifications**. While much of the activity aligns with normal system operations (e.g., Windows updates), the **non-standard process** and **lack of context** around `HxTsr.exe` warrant further analysis (e.g., checking process reputation, network behavior, or file hashes). \n\n**Recommendation:** Investigate `HxTsr.exe` for legitimacy and correlate with other telemetry (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to determine if it's malicious."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are related to svchost.exe performing actions like setting registry values and creating files. Now, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, it's also a common vector for malware because it's often used by attackers to hide malicious activities.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that there are multiple instances of \"Registry value set\" events. While changing registry values isn't inherently malicious, if it's happening frequently or in certain keys, it could indicate something's wrong. But in this case, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being modified. That's a bit of a red flag because without knowing the specific keys, it's hard to assess the risk.\n\nThen there are the file creation events. One of the files created is \"waasmedic.20250606_143612_048.etl\" in the Windows Logs directory. ETL files are trace logs used by Windows for diagnostics. Another file is \"edbtmp.log\" in the SoftwareDistribution folder, which is related to Windows Update. These files might be part of normal system operations, like updates or diagnostics. However, the presence of multiple file creations, especially in system directories, could be a sign of something unusual.\n\nAnother file mentioned is in the Download directory under SoftwareDistribution, which might be part of an update process. But the path includes a long string of characters, which might be a random name, which is common for temporary files. Still, that's not necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\nOne event has a \"process\" field as \"None,\" which means the process isn't identified. That could be a red flag because if the system can't identify the process, it might be a security bypass or an unknown executable. However, the event is a file creation in the WindowsUpdate Logs directory, which might be a legitimate log file.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: there's a lot of activity from svchost.exe, which is normal for system processes, but the repetition of registry changes and file creations might be indicative of something more. However, without more context, like specific registry keys or unusual file contents, it's hard to be certain. The presence of some legitimate system files doesn't rule out malicious activity entirely, but it's not conclusive either.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit low because the events alone don't provide enough evidence of malicious intent. They could be part of normal system operations, especially since svchost.exe is involved in many system tasks. However, the high frequency of registry changes and file creations might warrant further investigation. But since the classification is based on the entire batch, and there's no clear indication of a security threat, I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with a moderate confidence level, acknowledging that while there's activity, it's not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate system processes (svchost.exe) performing standard operations like registry modifications and file creation in system directories. No suspicious file paths, unexpected process names, or anomalous patterns are observed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe is involved in registry value setting and creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory. That's a common place for Windows Update stuff, but creating an Install folder and a file named AM_Delta_Patch... that might be a patch, but the name is a bit suspicious. Maybe a legitimate update, but sometimes malware uses similar names.\n\nThen there's MpSigStub.exe, which is part of Windows Defender. It's creating files in the Temp directory with names like mpasdlta.vdm and mpavdlta.vdm. These could be signature update files, which is normal for Defender. However, the presence of multiple files with those names might be a red flag if they're not expected. Also, the paths in the Temp folder are common for temporary files, but the number of files created here seems a bit high.\n\nLooking further, setup.exe is creating several files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. Files like ie_to_edge_stub.exe, cookie_exporter.exe, and others. Some of these might be legitimate parts of Edge installation, but the presence of elevated_tracing_service.exe and elevation_service.exe could be concerning. These names might indicate services that have elevated privileges, which could be a sign of something malicious if they're not part of a known legitimate process.\n\nThe RuntimeBroker.exe event is a registry value set, which is normal for some operations, but not particularly suspicious on its own. The powershell.exe event with ProcessAccess might be normal, but if it's accessing sensitive processes, that could be a concern. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of svchost.exe creating files that look like patches, MpSigStub.exe creating multiple temp files that might be signature updates, and setup.exe creating various Edge-related executables. The key points here are the unusual file names and the number of files created, especially in temp directories. However, some of these could be legitimate. The presence of multiple FileCreate events from different processes might indicate a legitimate software installation or update, but the lack of clear context makes it ambiguous. Since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, the answer would lean towards yes because there are multiple events that could indicate either normal operations or potential malicious activity, warranting further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of legitimate system activity and potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's a breakdown of key indicators:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity**\n1. **`svchost.exe` Creating Unusual Files**:\n   - The file `AM_Delta_Patch.exe` in the `SoftwareDistribution` directory is named in a way that resembles a Windows Update delta patch. However, **delta patches are typically managed internally by Windows Update**, and manual creation of such files by `svchost.exe` (a host process for system services) could indicate **tampering or unauthorized updates**.\n\n2. **`MpSigStub.exe` Generating Multiple Temp Files**:\n   - The creation of multiple `.vdm` files (e.g., `mpasdlta.vdm`, `mpavdlta.vdm`) in the `Temp` directory is **normal for Windows Defender signature updates**. However, **the sheer volume of files** and their generic names may suggest **anomalous behavior**, such as **malware masquerading as legitimate Defender components**.\n\n3. **`setup.exe` Deploying Edge-Related Executables**:\n   - The deployment of files like `elevated_tracing_service.exe` and `elevation_service.exe` under `Microsoft\\EdgeCore` raises concerns. These names imply **elevated privileges or system-level operations**, which could be **legitimate** (e.g., Edge updates) but may also indicate **malicious tools** attempting to **escalate privileges** or **persist on the system**.\n\n4. **`powershell.exe` Process Access**:\n   - While not inherently malicious, the `ProcessAccess` event could signal **unauthorized interaction with sensitive processes**, especially if tied to other suspicious events (e.g., file creation by `setup.exe`).\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **`svchost.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe`**: These processes are core to Windows system operations and Defender updates. Some file creation is expected.\n- **`setup.exe`**: Legitimate during software installations (e.g., Edge updates), though the specific files and paths require validation against known good baselines.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation**\n- **Correlate with Baselines**: Check if the files created (e.g., `AM_Delta_Patch.exe`, `.vdm` files) match known legitimate binaries or are flagged by antivirus tools.\n- **Analyze `setup.exe` Context**: Determine if the Edge-related files are part of a **legitimate update** or if the process is **unauthorized** (e.g., from a non-standard location).\n- **Monitor `powershell.exe`**: Investigate the `ProcessAccess` event for **unauthorized command execution** or **interaction with sensitive processes**.\n- **Check for Anomalies in Temp Files**: Verify if the `.vdm` files are signed by Microsoft and if their hashes match expected Defender update hashes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of events **merits further investigation** due to the combination of **unusual file creation patterns**, **potential privilege escalation**, and **ambiguous process behavior**. While some activity is legitimate, the **lack of clear context** and **presence of red flags** (e.g., `AM_Delta_Patch.exe`, elevated service names) suggest a need for deeper analysis to rule out malicious activity. \n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation**."}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: whoami.exe is run, which is a normal command to get the current user. Not suspicious on its own. Then there are several powershell.exe processes. Now, PowerShell is often used by attackers, so that's a red flag. Let me check the command line of one of them. Oh, there's a line where PowerShell is creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". That's unusual. Creating a new service isn't normal unless it's part of a legitimate setup. Also, the path is in a non-standard directory like \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\\". That's not typical for system services.\n\nNext, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. Some of these are normal, but the presence of multiple image loads might indicate that PowerShell is being used to execute code in a way that's not standard. Also, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute and then clean up traces. The file name is a PowerShell script, which could be part of an attack.\n\nThen, there are several Registry value set events from services.exe. While services.exe is a legitimate process, multiple registry changes might be an attempt to modify system settings or persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of a new service with a non-standard executable, the use of PowerShell for potentially malicious commands, the temporary file creation and deletion, and multiple image loads could all be indicators of an attack.

The next entry is a registry value set, but no file path is given. Hmm, maybe not significant.\n\nThen there are several entries with 'None' for process, winlog, and file. Those might be placeholders or errors, but not sure. But then there's an event with 'Execute a Remote Command' pointing to a .ps1 file in 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. That path seems unusual. 'unidade_logico' might be a custom directory, which is a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is executing a command that imports a module from that same path. The command line shows importing 'componente_auxiliar.ps1' and then trying to invoke 'Invoke-entrada_principal' with OutputDirectory set to $env:Temp. The use of $env:Temp is common, but the module path is suspicious. Also, the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events might indicate some automated or scripted process.\n\nPutting it all together: The initial .NET loads are normal, but the PowerShell activity involving a custom module path and executing remote commands is concerning. The repetition of the same command line suggests automation. The presence of 'Execute a Remote Command' and the custom directory path are indicators of potential malicious activity.

My job is to determine if this whole batch is interesting for investigation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the process entries. There's a PowerShell command that imports a module from \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". Then it tries to invoke something called \"Invoke-entrada_principal\" with output to the temp directory. There's also a catch block that exits with an exception HRESULT. Then it sleeps for 5 seconds. That seems suspicious because importing modules and executing commands with error handling could be part of a malicious script.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is used to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\" in the same directory structure. The service is then started. Creating a new service and starting it can be a sign of persistence mechanisms, which is common in malware. The repetition of these commands across multiple logs might indicate that this is being done repeatedly, perhaps to ensure the service is created even if it fails initially.\n\nThen there are entries under the \"Execute a Remote Command\" task, referencing the same \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\" script. This suggests that the script is being executed remotely, which is a red flag. Malicious actors often use remote execution to deploy payloads or maintain access.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The logs show the creation of a service, execution of a PowerShell script from a non-standard path, and multiple attempts to run commands. The paths mentioned have a structure that includes \"unidade_logico\" and \"registro_secundario\", which might be obfuscation or part of a custom framework. Also, the repeated entries could indicate that the attacker is trying to establish persistence or avoid detection by retrying the command.\n\nHowever, I should consider if these actions could be legitimate. For example, creating a service might be part of a legitimate application setup. But the combination of multiple suspicious activities, the use of PowerShell for these tasks, and the remote execution component makes me lean towards this being malicious.

There are a few other entries with different tasks like \"Logon\", \"Special Logon\", and \"Security Group Management\", but those don't have a process name. \n\nWait, the majority of the logs are about executing a remote command with the same PowerShell script. Even though the process is listed as \"None\", that might be a red flag. Typically, if a process is \"None\", it could mean that the event was logged without an associated process, which might be unusual. But maybe in some cases, that's normal. However, repeating the same file path multiple times for the same task could indicate something malicious. \n\nAlso, the fact that the same PowerShell script is being executed multiple times in a short period might be suspicious. PowerShell scripts are often used in attacks, especially if they're being run remotely. The repetition could suggest an attempt to execute a command repeatedly, maybe to bypass detection or to carry out a specific task. \n\nHowever, I should check if there are any other factors. The other entries with different tasks might be normal system activities, like logons. But the key here is the repetition of the same file and task. Even if the process is \"None\", the frequency and consistency of the event might indicate a potential security issue. \n\nSo, considering that, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" because the same remote command execution event is repeated multiple times with the same file path, which could be indicative of malicious activity. The confidence level would be high, maybe around 0.9, because the pattern is very repetitive and the same file is involved each time.

The \"winlog\" field has a task called \"Execute a Remote Command,\" and the file path is always \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". There are 16 entries with this pattern, and then a few others with different tasks like \"Windows Update Agent\" and one with \"task\": \"None\".\n\nFirst, the repetition of the same file path and task multiple times might be a red flag. Executing a remote command via a PowerShell script (since the file ends with .ps1) is often associated with malicious activities, like command and control communications or payload execution. However, I should check if there's any context indicating legitimacy. But in the given data, there's no information about the source of the command, user context, or any other processes involved. The \"process\" field is \"None\" in all cases, which might mean that the event logging isn't capturing the process details, or perhaps it's a limitation in the data collection.\n\nThen, there are a couple of entries with \"Windows Update Agent\" as the task, which is a normal system process. But the majority of the events are the same suspicious one. The repetition could indicate an ongoing or repeated attempt, which is concerning. However, if the system is configured to log these events multiple times, maybe it's a false positive. But without more context, like the user or the source IP, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe presence of multiple identical entries might suggest a log injection or a misconfiguration, but more likely, it's a genuine repeated action. Since the file is in a non-standard directory (\"unidade_logico\" which translates to \"logical unit\" in Portuguese), that's unusual. Typically, legitimate scripts are in more standard locations like Program Files or AppData. The filename \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\" (which means \"auxiliary component\") is also vague and doesn't indicate a clear purpose.\n\nConsidering all this, the repeated execution of the same PowerShell script from an unusual location, combined with the task being \"Execute a Remote Command,\" points towards potential malicious activity.
