So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are multiple instances of PowerShell commands being executed. Each of these commands is creating a scheduled task using the Register-ScheduledTask cmdlet. The command lines are similar, with variations in the task names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. The key part here is that they're all using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, which is a legitimate Windows application, but the context here might be suspicious.\n\nWait, the scheduled tasks are set to trigger at logon, and they're registered under the Administrators group with the highest run level. That's a red flag because typically, scheduled tasks run with the least privilege necessary. Using the Administrators group and Highest run level could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or perform actions that require higher permissions.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple such tasks being registered with different names might suggest an automated or repeated attempt to create these tasks. Even though calc.exe is a normal program, the combination of creating multiple scheduled tasks with elevated privileges could be part of a malicious activity, like setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, there are other events related to PowerShell, such as registry value sets and process accesses. However, the most concerning part is the scheduled task creation. The presence of multiple similar events pointing to the same suspicious behavior increases the likelihood that this is not a one-off incident but part of a larger pattern.\n\nThe other events involving chrome.exe and image loads (like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll) might be normal, but they don't seem directly related to the scheduled task creation. However, the repeated PowerShell activity with elevated permissions is a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch shows a pattern of creating multiple scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, which is unusual and potentially malicious. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges (RunLevel Highest) under the Administrators group, executing calc.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' loading image files like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These are all legitimate system files, part of .NET and Windows Defender. However, the fact that PowerShell is loading these might be normal, but I need to check for any anomalies.\n\nThen there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be a sign of something trying to execute a script without leaving traces. But maybe it's part of a legitimate process, like a test or temporary file.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command line that's creating a scheduled task with 'calc.exe' triggered at logon, set to run as Administrators with highest privileges. That's suspicious because using 'calc.exe' as a payload is a common indicator of malicious activity. The command is using the Scheduled Task module, which is a valid method, but the use of 'calc.exe' is odd unless it's a legitimate test. However, the command is written in a way that's typical of malware, like using the $Action and $Trigger variables.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for 'chrome.exe' setting registry values. Chrome might update its registry settings, but multiple entries in a short time could indicate something else. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The same applies to the 'Execute a Remote Command' events, but the process is listed as 'None', which might be a placeholder or an error in the log.\n\nPutting it all together: The PowerShell events, especially the scheduled task creation with calc.exe, are red flags. The file creation and deletion could be part of an attack, but the presence of the scheduled task with elevated privileges is more concerning. However, the other events (like Chrome's registry changes and the 'Execute a Remote Command' logs) might be noise or unrelated. But since the scheduled task is a clear indicator of potential malicious activity, even if other parts are normal, the batch as a whole is worth investigating. The confidence is around 0.75 because while some events are benign, the scheduled task with calc.exe is suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include suspicious activity: creation of a scheduled task with 'calc.exe' as payload, file creation\/deletion in Temp directory, and loading of system DLLs.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the entries have \"Execute a Remote Command\" in the winlog task. That's a red flag because executing remote commands can be part of an attack, like someone trying to run malicious code. But there are a lot of them, all the same. Maybe it's a false positive or a normal process? But then I see some other entries.\n\nLooking further, there's a process with powershell.exe that's creating a scheduled task. The command line shows they're using New-ScheduledTaskAction to run calc.exe, which is a common technique for persistence. The user is set to Administrators with high privileges. That's suspicious because creating a scheduled task with admin rights could be part of an attack.\n\nThen there's WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's the Windows Task Scheduler service, so maybe that's normal. But combined with the scheduled task creation, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nNext, svchost.exe is setting registry values multiple times. svchost is a normal Windows process, but if it's modifying the registry, especially if it's part of a persistence mechanism, that's concerning. Also, there's a file created in the Tasks directory called \"unidade_comum,\" which might be a scheduled task name. The name \"unidade_comum\" doesn't ring a bell, but it's possible it's a custom name for a malicious task.\n\nThen, powershell.exe is creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for malware to store configuration files. Also, another file is created in Downloads, which might be a log or a script being executed.\n\nChrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV is related to Microsoft Defender. If Chrome is loading these, maybe it's being used to bypass detection, or it's a legitimate process. But combined with other suspicious activities, it's worth checking.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat process creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of normal operations. But if the file is in the Downloads directory, maybe it's being used to exfiltrate data.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple remote command executions, scheduled task creation with admin privileges, registry modifications by svchost, file creations in unusual locations, and processes like Chrome and PowerShell involved. These are all signs that could indicate a security incident, especially the scheduled task and registry changes. The repetition of \"Execute a Remote Command\" might be part of a larger attack. Even though some processes are normal, the combination of these events makes me think this is worth investigating further. So the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events including repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks, PowerShell creating a scheduled task with admin privileges, svchost.exe modifying registry values, and file creation in sensitive directories.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there are eight entries where the process is chrome.exe and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Then there's one entry with chrome.exe again but the task is \"Dns query (rule: DnsQuery)\". After that, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe with a file created in a specific path, and another from powershell.exe creating a file named \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\".\n\nHmm, so the first thing I notice is that chrome.exe is modifying the registry multiple times. Normally, chrome might make some registry changes, but doing it eight times in a row could be suspicious. But wait, maybe it's just normal behavior? However, if it's all the same process and same action, that might be a sign of something automated or malicious. But then again, maybe not. Need to check if there's any other context.\n\nThen there's the DNS query. Chrome doing a DNS query isn't too unusual, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe. However, the other two events are about file creation. The winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's just part of its normal operation when it's configuring itself. The other file is created by powershell.exe with a name \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\". The name is in Spanish, which might be a red flag if it's part of a malicious script or if the user isn't expecting that. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, considering all events together. The majority are from chrome.exe modifying the registry. If that's normal for chrome, maybe not. But if it's an unusual number of times, that might be a problem. However, the other events are from legitimate processes (winlogbeat and powershell) doing normal things. The DNS query is also normal. The file created by powershell might be benign, but the name is suspicious. However, there's no indication of malicious activity here. The justification for being interesting would be if there's a combination of events that suggest something's wrong. But in this case, the chrome.exe events are all the same, and the other events don't show signs of compromise. Maybe the user is just monitoring their system and these are normal activities. Alternatively, if the registry changes are related to something like persistence or configuration changes, that could be a concern. However, without more details on what registry keys are being modified, it's hard to say. \n\nSo, the confidence here might be low to moderate. Since the majority of events are from chrome.exe doing registry modifications, but no other suspicious activities are present. However, the presence of multiple registry changes might be worth looking into. But since the classification requires a single decision, maybe it's not interesting enough. Alternatively, if the system is under investigation, even normal activities might be considered. But the justification needs to be concise. Maybe the answer is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The chrome.exe events are repetitive but not necessarily harmful, and the other events are from legitimate processes. The file names might be a red flag, but without more context, it's not enough to classify as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show repetitive registry modifications by chrome.exe (common for legitimate processes) and normal file creation by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. No clear malicious indicators or anomalous patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
