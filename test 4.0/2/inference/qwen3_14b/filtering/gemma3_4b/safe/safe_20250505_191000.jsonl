{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so that's normal. But then there's rundll32.exe executing a command with shell32.dll and some GUID. That GUID part might be a red flag. Sometimes, malicious software uses unusual GUIDs or embeds parameters that aren't standard. The command line looks a bit odd with -Embedding, which is sometimes used in exploits.\n\nNext, there's svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be part of its normal operation, but it's worth checking if that's expected. Then, EXCEL.EXE is loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. But the fact that Excel is loading so many DLLs might be normal too, especially if it's processing a CSV file.\n\nWait, there's also WmiPrvSE.exe loading wmiutils.dll. That seems okay, but WmiPrvSE is related to WMI, which can be abused by malware. However, the log doesn't show any unusual parameters here. \n\nLooking back at the rundll32.exe event, the command line includes a GUID and -Embedding. The GUID isn't one I recognize as standard. Maybe that's a sign of something trying to execute a script or payload through WMI. Also, the fact that there are multiple events with User Account Management and Special Logon might indicate some account activity, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of SDXHelper.exe loading the same DLLs multiple times. That might be normal if it's part of a legitimate process, but if it's doing it excessively, that could be a problem. However, the logs don't show any errors or unusual behavior in that regard.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file might be normal if it's part of a configuration change. But if that's unexpected, it could be an indicator. However, without knowing the user's environment, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting this together, the most suspicious part is the rundll32.exe command with the unusual GUID and -Embedding parameter. That could be a sign of a malicious payload being executed. However, there's not enough evidence to confirm it's malicious. The other events don't show clear signs of compromise. So, the classification might be interesting but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Suspicious activity detected with rundll32.exe executing a command involving a non-standard GUID and -Embedding parameter, which is often used in exploit scenarios. Multiple image loads of legitimate DLLs by SDXHelper.exe and EXCEL.EXE could indicate normal behavior, but the combination with the rundll32.exe event raises potential concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are about \"User Account Management\" under winlog's task. But those are all null for process and file. Maybe those are just normal system events, like user logins or account changes. But then there are a few events involving EXCEL.EXE. Let's check those.\n\nThe first interesting event is when EXCEL.EXE loads an image, specifically coml2.dll from System32. Wait, coml2.dll is a legitimate Windows file, part of the Common Language Runtime. But loading it from System32 might be normal. However, sometimes attackers might use legitimate processes to load malicious DLLs. But in this case, the path is correct. Hmm, maybe not suspicious here.\n\nThen there are multiple DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE. DNS queries themselves aren't necessarily bad, but if there's a pattern or unusual domains involved, that could be a red flag. However, the logs don't specify the domains being queried. So that's a bit unclear. Maybe the frequency is high, but the logs show several entries, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNext, EXCEL.EXE creates a file named real_values.csv.LNK in the Recent folder. .LNK files are shortcuts. Creating a shortcut isn't inherently malicious, but if it's pointing to something suspicious, that could be an issue. However, the log only shows the creation of the shortcut, not its target. The filename includes \"real_values,\" which might be a red herring. Maybe the attacker is trying to hide malicious activity under a benign-sounding name.\n\nNow, looking at the combination of events: multiple DNS queries, a file creation of a shortcut, and loading a DLL. But all the processes are EXCEL.EXE, which is a common application. However, Excel is often used in phishing or macro-based attacks. If the user is running Excel and it's performing these actions, maybe it's part of a malicious macro. But the logs don't mention any macro activity or unusual process behavior beyond the DNS queries and file creation.\n\nWait, the first few events are all User Account Management with no process or file info. Those might be normal events, like user logins or account changes. But if there's a lot of them, maybe it's a sign of brute force attacks or account enumeration. However, the logs don't indicate failed login attempts or other suspicious activity related to user accounts. So maybe those are just regular system events.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious events are the DNS queries and the shortcut creation. However, without more context like the domains being queried or the content of the shortcut, it's hard to be certain. But the presence of multiple DNS queries from Excel and the creation of a .LNK file might indicate some form of network communication or data exfiltration. However, since the logs don't show any obvious malicious indicators like unexpected network destinations or the shortcut pointing to a malicious file, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nThe confidence here would be moderate. The events are not extremely suspicious on their own, but the combination of unusual activities (DNS queries, shortcut creation) from a legitimate process (Excel) might warrant further investigation. Therefore, classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DNS queries and file creation events linked to EXCEL.EXE, which may indicate unusual network activity or persistence mechanisms. The creation of a .LNK file in the Recent directory could be related to user interaction or potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
