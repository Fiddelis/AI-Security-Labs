{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's powershell.exe showing up with various events. \n\nLooking at the powershell.exe entries: there's a ProcessCreate event with a command line that includes \"ls -recurse\", \"get-childitem -recurse\", and \"gci -recurse\". These are commands that list files recursively, which might be part of a script. But why is PowerShell doing this? Also, there are multiple ProcessAccess events and RegistryEvent entries. \n\nThen, there are ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading several DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. That's normal, but the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might be worth noting. \n\nA FileCreate event is logged for a temporary script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1. Then immediately after, a FileDelete event for the same file. Creating and deleting a script file quickly could be a red flag. Maybe the script was executed and then deleted to avoid leaving traces. \n\nAlso, the command line for one of the PowerShell processes includes executing a script that lists files recursively. This might be part of a reconnaissance phase, trying to gather information about the file system. \n\nHowever, the user needs to know if this is interesting. The key points here are the creation and deletion of a script file, the use of PowerShell for file operations, and the multiple process and registry accesses. While some of these activities are normal, the combination of creating a temporary script and then deleting it quickly might indicate malicious intent, such as executing a script without leaving evidence. \n\nBut wait, the script's name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which sounds like it could be part of a legitimate test or policy check. However, the fact that it's created in the Temp directory and deleted immediately is suspicious. Also, the repeated use of PowerShell for file operations and registry changes could be part of a larger attack. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch does show some unusual activity that might warrant further investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities are normal, but the combination of events is concerning enough to be classified as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit suspicious behavior including file creation\/deletion of a temporary script file, recursive directory listing commands, and loading of .NET framework DLLs. The rapid creation and deletion of the script file in the Temp directory suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user has provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, I should look for any patterns or suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being run with the same command line: ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, etc. That seems like someone is listing files recursively. But why so many times? Maybe it's a normal activity, but repeated commands could be a red flag. Also, the winlog tasks include things like Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, Pipe Created, Image loaded, File created, Registry value set. \n\nWait, one entry mentions the file path 'C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpClient.dll'. That's a legitimate Windows Defender file, but if it's being loaded, maybe that's normal. However, the fact that it's logged might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's a file created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_principal.txt' and another at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. Creating files in the user's downloads folder is common, but the StartupProfileData file might be related to PowerShell profiles. If someone is creating a startup profile, that could be a sign of persistence, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe registry value set events are common, but multiple entries from svchost.exe and powershell.exe might indicate some changes. However, svchost.exe is a normal system process, so that's not necessarily bad. \n\nBut wait, the repetition of the same PowerShell command multiple times might be an attempt to gather information. Also, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file could be part of a configuration change. However, without more context, like unauthorized access or unexpected network activity, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe classification here is tricky. The logs show normal system activities, but the repetition of commands and file creations might be worth investigating. However, there's no clear evidence of a security breach. Maybe the user is just running some scripts. But since the same command is repeated several times, maybe it's a sign of something trying to map the file system. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the confidence is moderate. It's not a clear attack, but there are enough unusual patterns to warrant further investigation. So, classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.6. The justification is the repeated PowerShell commands and file creations that could indicate reconnaissance or unauthorized activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated PowerShell commands using 'get-childitem -recurse' may indicate file system reconnaissance. File creation events in user directories and registry modifications could suggest potential malicious activity or configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the entries here have the process as \"None\" and the winlog task as \"User Account Management\". That's a lot of repeated entries. But then there are a few other events. Let me check them one by one.\n\nThe first event with a process is winlogbeat.exe creating a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal; winlogbeat is a tool for collecting logs, so creating a config file might be part of its setup. Not necessarily malicious, but maybe worth a look if there's unexpected activity.\n\nNext, RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe setting registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, handling app permissions, so that's normal. Notepad setting a registry value might be odd, but maybe it's part of a legitimate action. However, if notepad is doing something unusual, that could be a red flag. But without more context, hard to say.\n\nThen powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. But the task here is \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\", which might indicate someone is trying to interact with the process. Not sure yet.\n\nThen calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Calculator is a normal app, but loading urlmon.dll from System32 is expected. That's a standard component for handling URLs. So that seems okay.\n\nAnother svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a host process for Windows services, so that's normal. But if there are multiple instances or unexpected changes, that could be an issue. However, here it's just a couple of entries.\n\nAnother Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again. Same as before.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: most events are related to User Account Management with no process, which might be a log source issue or a misconfiguration. But the other events don't show obvious malicious activity. The winlogbeat file creation is part of setup, and the other processes are either normal or not suspicious on their own. However, the high number of User Account Management events without processes might indicate a problem, like a failed logon attempt or something else. But without more details, it's hard to be certain.\n\nConfidence-wise, since there's no clear malicious activity, but some events are a bit odd, maybe a medium confidence. The justification would be that while some events are normal, the repeated User Account Management logs without processes could be worth investigating for possible misconfiguration or failed attempts.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events primarily show normal system activity (e.g., winlogbeat config creation, standard process behavior). No clear indicators of compromise or suspicious patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
