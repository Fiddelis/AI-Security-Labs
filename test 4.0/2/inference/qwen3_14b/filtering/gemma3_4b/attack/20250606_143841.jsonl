The first thing I notice is that PowerShell is being used multiple times, which isn't necessarily bad, but when combined with other events, it could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the events, there's a command line that stands out: \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\". This command is trying to create a new PSDrive pointing to a remote machine's C$ share. That's a common technique in lateral movement during attacks. The use of UNC paths like \\\\Target\\\\C$ suggests the attacker might be trying to access another system on the network.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events. PowerShell loading .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. While these are legitimate system files, the fact that they're being loaded multiple times might indicate something unusual. However, I need to check if this is normal behavior for PowerShell scripts.\n\nAnother event is the creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary script file: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1. Creating a file and then deleting it could be part of an attack to execute a script without leaving evidence. However, the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be related to PowerShell's execution policy checks. That could be a red herring, but the fact that the file is created in the Temp directory and then deleted quickly might be suspicious.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, which could be used for inter-process communication. In some cases, this is used by malware to communicate stealthily. But again, it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell with ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks might indicate that the attacker is trying to manipulate the system's registry or access other processes. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nConsidering all these points: the remote drive mapping, the creation of a temporary script file, and the multiple image loads, this does look like potential malicious activity. However, some of these events could be part of normal PowerShell operations, especially if the user is running scripts that interact with remote systems or modify the registry. But the combination of these events, especially the remote drive creation and the temporary file, raises a red flag.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe being accessed or created. There's also a cmd.exe and whoami.exe process. The winlog tasks include ProcessAccess, ProcessCreate, ImageLoad, and others. The files mentioned are mostly system files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and some from Windows Defender. There's also a temporary file created and then deleted in the AppData folder.\n\nHmm, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The repeated access and creation of PowerShell processes might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be suspicious. The ImageLoad events for .NET assemblies are normal, but the presence of multiple ImageLoads might indicate something. Also, the temporary file being created and then deleted could be a red flag. Attackers often use temporary files to execute malicious scripts and then delete them to avoid leaving evidence.\n\nAnother thing is the use of whoami.exe, which is a standard command to get user information. However, if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack. The Pipe Created event could be normal, but again, in combination with other events, it might be part of a more complex attack scenario.\n\nThe fact that there's a File Delete logged event for the temporary file suggests that someone tried to clean up after creating it. This is often seen in malware operations. Also, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes accessing different system files might indicate that the system is being probed or that there's an attempt to execute scripts.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these events could be part of normal system operations or legitimate scripts. For example, PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, and the .NET assemblies are part of the framework. But the combination of creating a file, then deleting it, along with multiple PowerShell activities, raises suspicion.\n\nThe confidence here would be somewhere around 0.7.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like Registry value set, Process accessed, Image loaded, File created, and File Delete. There's also one event for whoami.exe. Let me break this down.\n\nStarting with the PowerShell activities. The tasks include accessing processes, modifying registry values, loading images (which are DLL files), creating and deleting files. The files being loaded are mostly system-related DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal for PowerShell, but the frequency might be a red flag.\n\nWait, there's a file created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_gbsqa1tg.2k0.ps1, then immediately deleted. That could be part of a script execution, maybe testing script policies. But then there's another file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That might be related to PowerShell profiles, which can be used to execute scripts automatically. \n\nThe repeated Process accessed and Registry value set events might indicate that PowerShell is being used to manipulate system settings or access other processes, which is common in malicious activities. However, PowerShell is a legitimate tool, so context is key. \n\nLooking at the image loads, the DLLs are all legitimate system components. However, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll might be normal, but if there's unexpected behavior with them, it could be a concern. \n\nThe whoami.exe event is just a standard command to get user information, which is normal. \n\nNow, considering the combination of events. The creation and deletion of a temporary script file, along with multiple registry and process accesses, might suggest that someone is trying to execute scripts or modify system settings. However, without more context, like unusual commands or unexpected network activity, it's hard to be certain. \n\nBut the fact that there are multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs could be part of a legitimate PowerShell operation. However, the repeated ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks might indicate that the process is interacting with other processes or changing system configurations, which could be part of an attack. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. The events alone don't show obvious malicious activity, but the combination of multiple PowerShell events, file creation\/deletion, and registry changes could be suspicious. However, since there's no direct evidence like payload execution, network calls, or unusual commands in the command_line (except for the whoami.exe), it might not be conclusive. \n\nSo, the confidence is moderate.

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several instances of 'whoami.exe' being run. That's a normal command to check the current user, so probably benign. Then there's 'powershell.exe' being accessed multiple times. But looking at the command line in one of the entries, there's a PowerShell script that checks if a file exists at a certain path. The path mentioned is 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe'. Wait, the '..' in the path might be a red flag. That could be an attempt to traverse directories, maybe trying to access a file that's not in the expected location. Also, the script exits 0 if the file exists, else 1. Not sure what that's for, but maybe part of a larger attack.\n\nThen, there are multiple 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, loading various .dll files. Some of these are standard .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. But one of them is 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but maybe loaded in an unexpected context. However, that alone might not be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing is the creation and deletion of a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. That's common for PowerShell scripts, but the name '__PSScriptPolicyTest_h1gpo202.5ec.ps1' seems a bit odd. Maybe it's related to testing script execution policies, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at the sequence: the PowerShell process checks for the existence of procdump.exe in a path that uses directory traversal. Procdump is a legitimate tool, but if it's being accessed in a way that's not standard, that could be a sign. Also, the fact that there are multiple process accesses and image loads might indicate that the PowerShell process is doing more than usual.\n\nHowever, none of the events show direct signs of malware, like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, or modifying system settings.

That path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender... Hmm, that's a legitimate path for Windows Defender. Maybe a normal operation, but I should note it.\n\nNext, another event where powershell.exe creates a file in the user's AppData folder. That's a common place for temporary files, but could also be a red flag if it's creating unexpected files. But just creating a file might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen, there are several registry events and process accesses related to powershell.exe. Multiple ProcessAccess events might indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated, which could be a sign of something malicious. But again, it depends on context.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user info, so not necessarily bad. But if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe.\n\nThe big red flag here is the event where cmd.exe runs \"netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off\". Disabling the firewall is a clear malicious action. That's a strong indicator of an attack, as it would allow the attacker to bypass firewall protections.\n\nAlso, there are multiple registry events related to svchost.exe. svchost.exe is a legitimate system process, but if it's making a lot of registry changes, that could be suspicious. However, in this case, the events are about registry object added or deleted. If those changes are part of a legitimate update or configuration change, it might not be bad. But combined with other events, like the firewall disable, it's more concerning.\n\nPutting it all together: the disabling of the firewall via netsh is a clear sign of malicious intent. That alone would make this batch interesting. Even if other events are normal, that one action is significant.

However, it's also commonly abused by malware to hide malicious activities. The fact that there are so many registry events here is notable.

My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to svchost.exe and registry changes. Specifically, there are multiple entries with the task \"Registry object added or deleted (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and one with \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Then there's a few entries involving PowerShell commands creating a new PSDrive pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$.\n\nNow, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, if it's performing a lot of registry modifications, that might be suspicious. But wait, there are 18 entries of the same registry event. That's a lot. But are they all the same? The task description is the same each time. However, if this is a normal system process, maybe there's legitimate activity here. But maybe not. Also, the fact that there are multiple events could indicate something automated or malicious.\n\nThen there's the PowerShell command: \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\". The command is trying to create a new drive mapping to a remote machine's C$ share. The use of \"unidade_auxiliar\" might be a typo or a non-English term, but the key part is the UNC path. Creating a PSDrive to a remote machine's administrative share (C$) could be part of a lateral movement in a network attack. The repeated execution of this command might indicate an attempt to establish persistent access or map network drives for further exploitation.\n\nAlso, the events include \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks, which might be related to PowerShell's internal processes. However, the combination of registry changes and PowerShell activities could be a red flag. \n\nBut wait, are there any other indicators? The same process (svchost.exe) is involved in these events. Normally, svchost.exe might be involved in registry changes if a service is starting or modifying settings. However, the repetition and the specific PowerShell commands might be more indicative of malicious activity. \n\nI should also check if the PowerShell commands are part of a legitimate script or if they're being used in an unexpected way. The command uses \"& {\" which is a way to execute a script block. The use of \"New-PSDrive\" to map a network share could be part of a legitimate script, but in this case, since it's repeated multiple times and combined with registry events, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple registry events from svchost.exe and repeated PowerShell commands mapping a network drive. This could be a sign of malicious activity, such as an attacker trying to establish persistence or access remote systems. However, I need to consider that some of these events might be normal.

The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a PowerShell command that creates a new PSDrive with the name 'g' pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That seems suspicious because creating a drive to a remote machine's C$ share could be part of an attack, like accessing files on another system. But I need to check other events too.\n\nThen, there are a bunch of other PowerShell commands with empty script blocks, like 'powershell.exe & {}' repeated multiple times. Those might be benign, maybe just testing or placeholder commands. However, the repetition could be a red flag if they're part of a larger attack pattern.\n\nFurther down, there are several instances of a PowerShell script checking if a file exists at \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..\\registro_secundario\\procdump.exe\". Procdump is a legitimate tool, but it's sometimes used by attackers to dump memory. The path here has some odd directory structures with '..' which might indicate an attempt to access files in parent directories, possibly trying to find or execute a tool. The repeated checks could suggest the attacker is verifying the presence of procdump.exe before proceeding with some action, like dumping processes or exfiltrating data.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events: the initial PSDrive creation, followed by multiple checks for procdump.exe. This could be part of a multi-stage attack where the attacker first maps a network drive and then checks for tools on the system. The repetition of the same command multiple times might indicate automated checks or attempts to bypass detection.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these might be false positives. For example, the empty script blocks could be harmless. But the presence of both the PSDrive and the procdump checks increases the likelihood of malicious activity. The use of 'Test-Path' in the script is a common technique in PowerShell for checking file existence, which is normal, but the context here—along with the other events—makes it more suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating a network drive and checking for a tool like procdump.exe, especially in a repeated manner, suggests potential malicious intent.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. Both entries are process events with the same command line. The command line is a PowerShell script that checks if a file exists at \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..\\registro_secundario\\procdump.exe\". If it exists, it exits with 0; otherwise, 1.\n\nFirst, I notice that both events are identical. That might be a sign of something, but maybe it's just a normal process being logged twice. However, the key part here is the file path being checked. The path has some odd elements. The use of \"..\\\" suggests that the script is navigating up a directory. Let me parse that path again. Starting at \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\", then moving up to the parent directory with \"..\\\", then into \"registro_secundario\". So the full path would be \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\procdump.exe\". Wait, but the original path has \"registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\", which would resolve to \"registro_secundario\" under \"unidade_logico\". But maybe the path is trying to access a file in a different location than expected. \n\nNow, procdump.exe is a legitimate tool from Sysinternals, often used for dumping processes. However, it's also a tool that can be abused by attackers. The fact that the script is checking for the existence of procdump.exe might be part of a larger malicious process. For example, the script could be part of a dropper that checks if the tool is present before proceeding. If the file isn't there, it might trigger an error or a different action. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the use of PowerShell. While PowerShell is a common administrative tool, its use in certain contexts can be suspicious, especially if it's obfuscated or part of a sequence of commands that are not typical. However, in this case, the command is just checking a file path. But why would that be of interest? Maybe because it's part of a larger attack chain. For instance, if the script is part of a process that's trying to determine if certain tools are present to use them for further attacks. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. The events themselves don't show any direct malicious activity, just a check for a file. However, the presence of procdump.exe in the path might be a red flag. Also, the fact that the script is checking for the existence of a specific file could be part of a larger malicious plan. But since the events don't include any actual execution of procdump.exe or any other suspicious activity, it's not clear. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking to analyze the entire batch. Since both events are the same, maybe it's a repeated check. However, without more context, like other events that show the actual use of procdump.exe or other malicious activities, it's hard to say. The justification here would be that the script is checking for a specific file (procdump.exe) in a path that may be attempting to access a tool that could be used for malicious purposes. However, since the events only show the check and not the actual use, the confidence might be moderate. \n\nSo, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" because the check for procdump.exe is suspicious, even though no actual malicious action is taken in these events.
