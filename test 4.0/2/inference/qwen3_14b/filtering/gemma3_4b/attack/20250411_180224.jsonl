So, the user wants me to analyze the batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first entry: powershell.exe with a registry value set. Not too suspicious yet. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's creating a scheduled task with schtasks. The command line here is interesting because it's setting up a task to run daily as the system user, using powershell.exe with -ep bypass and a script path. The script name is \"NonExistingScript.ps1\" which might be a red flag because the file doesn't exist. That could be a sign of an attempted attack, maybe trying to execute a non-existent script to bypass detection.\n\nNext, there's a process accessed event for powershell.exe again. Then cmd.exe and schtasks.exe entries. The schtasks.exe is creating a task named \"win32times\" which is set to run daily. The command line again references the same non-existing script. Also, there's a file created event for svchost.exe, but that's part of the system processes. However, multiple registry value set events for svchost.exe might indicate some tampering, but I need to check more.\n\nWait, there's a file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times. That's the scheduled task folder, so creating a task there is normal. But the task is set to run as the system user with a non-existent script. That's suspicious. Also, the use of -ep bypass in powershell.exe is a common tactic to bypass execution policies, which is often used in attacks.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple registry events for chrome.exe, but they might be benign unless there's a specific change. However, the main concern here is the scheduled task setup with the non-existent script. The attacker might be trying to establish persistence by creating a scheduled task that runs a malicious script, but the script isn't there yet. Maybe they intended to place it later, or it's a mistake. Either way, creating a scheduled task with such parameters is a red flag.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple registry value sets for svchost.exe and other processes could indicate some level of system manipulation. However, the key points here are the scheduled task creation with the non-existent script and the use of -ep bypass. Those are strong indicators of potential malicious activity.\n\nThe confidence here would be high because the combination of creating a scheduled task with a non-existent script, using bypass execution policy, and multiple registry changes suggests an attempt to compromise the system. Even though some events might be normal, the overall pattern points to something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: scheduled task creation with non-existent script path (c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1), use of PowerShell with -ep bypass (common in attacks), and repeated registry modifications. These indicate potential malicious activity attempting to establish persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe created a file called .winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a legitimate tool used for logging, so creating a config file makes sense. Not suspicious here.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe created a file named entrada_ativo.txt. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Creating a text file isn't necessarily bad, but it's something to note. Maybe it's part of normal user activity, but could be a red flag if there's more context.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe accessed a process. The file path is None, which might mean the event doesn't involve a file. Process access can be normal, but if it's accessing other processes without permission, that's suspicious. However, with just this info, it's hard to tell.\n\nFourth event: whoami.exe was executed. That's a standard command to get user info. If it's run normally, it's not a problem. But if it's part of a larger attack, like checking privileges, it could be concerning. But alone, it's just a regular command.\n\nFifth event: Again, powershell.exe accessed a process. Same as the third event. Multiple process accesses by PowerShell might indicate something, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a mix of normal activities (winlogbeat creating a config, whoami running) and some PowerShell activity. But creating a text file and accessing processes isn't enough to confirm malicious intent. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events and the creation of a file named entrada_ativo.txt (which might be a Portuguese term for \"input_active\" or something similar) could be part of a larger pattern. Maybe the user is doing something benign, but the combination of events might warrant further investigation. The confidence isn't super high, but there's enough to flag it as interesting for closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes creating files and accessing other processes may indicate potential malicious activity, though not definitively confirmed. The presence of both legitimate (winlogbeat) and potentially suspicious (PowerShell file creation\/access) events warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
