{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there are multiple entries about chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that's expected, but notepad.exe modifying the registry might be odd. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a legitimate tool. The next entry is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows file, so that might be normal. But then there's a cmd.exe process with a long command line that uses schtasks to create scheduled tasks. The command line includes creating tasks that run calc.exe on logon and startup. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with system privileges could be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking further, there's another schtasks.exe process creating another task, and svchost.exe modifying the registry multiple times. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, so that's normal. However, the scheduled tasks created here are named in a way that seems arbitrary, like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". These names don't follow standard naming conventions, which might indicate someone is trying to obfuscate their activities.\n\nAlso, the command line arguments for schtasks include running calc.exe, which is a simple calculator. While calc.exe itself is benign, using it in this context might be a way to execute commands without triggering alerts. The fact that these tasks are set to run on logon and startup suggests the attacker wants persistence.\n\nAnother point is the multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and other processes. While some registry changes are normal, multiple changes from different processes could indicate an attempt to modify system settings for malicious purposes.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious activities are the creation of scheduled tasks with unusual names, the use of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe to set up these tasks, and the potential for persistence through these tasks. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events and the command lines used raises a red flag. The confidence level is high because the behavior aligns with common attack patterns, like establishing persistence via scheduled tasks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Creation of scheduled tasks with obfuscated names (e.g., 'elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon') using schtasks.exe to execute calc.exe, which is unusual for legitimate system behavior. 2) Unusual registry modifications by multiple processes (notepad.exe, powershell.exe, svchost.exe). 3) Potential persistence mechanism through scheduled tasks configured to run on logon\/startup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple svchost.exe processes performing \"Registry value set\" tasks. That's common, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then, there's an entry where a file is created at 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup'. Creating a task in the System32 directory under Tasks could be a red flag. That's a common place for scheduled tasks, but if it's a new task, especially with a name like \"pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup\", that might be something malicious trying to set up persistence.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe and conhost.exe also doing registry changes. Not sure yet. Then ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe doing the same. Those are normal processes, but if they're doing unexpected registry changes, that's a concern. Powershell.exe is involved in registry changes and a Process accessed event. PowerShell is often used by attackers, so that's a point to note.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are numerous. They have registry changes, pipe creation, and image loaded events. The image loaded events include amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. If a legitimate process is loading those, it's normal. But if an attacker is bypassing them, maybe that's an issue. However, the logs here don't show any anomalies in that regard.\n\nAnother file creation event is from winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. Creating a .yml.new file in the downloads directory might be part of configuration, but not necessarily malicious. However, the presence of a file named \"unidade_ativo.txt\" created by powershell.exe could be a data exfiltration attempt or just a benign file. The name doesn't immediately scream malicious, but the fact that PowerShell is creating files might be part of something.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious point is the creation of the task in the System32\\Tasks directory. That's a common tactic for persistence. Even though other processes are involved, the key indicator here is the file creation in a sensitive location. The rest of the events might be normal, but that one task creation is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. So, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75. The justification is the suspicious file creation in the System32 tasks folder.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'Registry value set' events from svchost.exe and chrome.exe, combined with a file created in the System32\\\\Tasks directory (potential persistence mechanism). PowerShell activity and file creation in user downloads directory also raise suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. There are several instances where 'chrome.exe' is involved with the task 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'. Chrome modifying the registry isn't necessarily bad, but doing it multiple times might be suspicious. However, I know that Chrome can sometimes modify the registry for updates or extensions. But the same task repeated multiple times could indicate something else, like a malicious script trying to change registry keys.\n\nThen there's 'powershell.exe' appearing twice with 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)'. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. However, seeing it accessed multiple times might be a red flag, especially if it's part of a chain of events. But in this case, there's no additional info like command lines or other processes involved.\n\nAnother entry is 'whoami.exe' with the command line showing it's being executed. Whoami is a standard tool for checking user context, so that's probably legitimate. But if it's being run in an unusual context or combined with other suspicious activities, that could be a problem.\n\nNow, looking at the combination. Chrome modifying the registry multiple times, along with PowerShell access events. But without more context, like the specific registry keys changed or the processes interacting with each other, it's hard to say. However, the repetition of the same event (chrome.exe modifying registry) multiple times might indicate a potential issue. But maybe it's just normal behavior. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that the events are in JSONL format, and I should consider the entire batch. The repetition of the same event (same process and task) several times might be a sign of something automated or malicious. However, if these are all from legitimate activities, like Chrome updates, then it's not a problem. But without more data, like the registry keys being modified or other processes involved, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut the presence of multiple registry modifications by Chrome could be a sign of a registry-based attack, such as changing settings to persist or disable security features. However, that's a bit of a stretch without more context. On the other hand, the other events (PowerShell and whoami) are more common and less suspicious.\n\nHmm. The confidence here is tricky. The events aren't extremely suspicious on their own, but the repetition of the same event multiple times might warrant further investigation. So, I might lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence. The justification would be the repeated registry modifications by Chrome, which could be indicative of malicious activity, even though it's not definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe instances triggering 'Registry value set' events may indicate suspicious registry modifications, potentially related to persistence or configuration changes. Combined with PowerShell process access events, this could suggest lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
