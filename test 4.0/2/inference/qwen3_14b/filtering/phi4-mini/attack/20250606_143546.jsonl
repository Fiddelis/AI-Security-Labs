First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess event. Not too bad, PowerShell is common. Then whoami.exe is run, which is a normal command to check user. But then there's another PowerShell process accessing the registry. Still normal.\n\nWait, looking further, there's a PowerShell process with a command line that imports a module from a path that looks odd: \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The path has some Portuguese terms like \"unidade_logico\" (logical unit) and \"registro_comum\" (common register). That might be a red flag because it's not a standard path. Also, the command line uses a lot of backslashes and seems to be trying to load a script from a non-standard location. That could be part of an attack.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Some of these are .NET related, which is normal for PowerShell, but MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender. Maybe that's normal, but combined with other events?\n\nThere's a file created in the Temp directory, then deleted. That's common for scripts to write temporary files, but the fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might be part of an attack. Also, the PipeEvent for PowerShell could be used for inter-process communication, which might be benign but could also be part of something malicious.\n\nLooking at other processes like svchost.exe and sppsvc.exe creating files in standard locations like SoftwareDistribution and spp store. Those are normal system processes, so their activities might be legitimate. However, the combination with PowerShell's suspicious activities might indicate something.\n\nThe key points here are the unusual PowerShell command line with the non-standard path, the multiple ImageLoad events, and the temporary file creation and deletion. These could be signs of a malicious script being executed. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. But the presence of these events together does raise suspicion.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll scan through each entry to see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory under Metadata. The process involved is svchost.exe, which is a legitimate Windows process, but it's often used by malware to hide its activities. The files created here include things like UpdateAgent.dll, dpx.dll, Mitigation.dll, etc. Hmm, those names don't immediately ring a bell as standard Windows files. Typically, the SoftwareDistribution folder is related to Windows Update, so maybe these files are part of an update. But creating multiple DLLs in the Metadata subdirectory might be suspicious. I should check if that's normal.\n\nThen there are some ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll, which are part of Windows, so that's probably normal. The registry value set events don't have file paths, which might be a red flag. But svchost.exe interacting with the registry is common, so maybe not.\n\nWait, the first few events are all svchost.exe creating DLLs in the Metadata folder. That seems unusual. Normally, updates would be handled by specific processes like Windows Update or the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS). If svchost.exe is creating these files, perhaps it's a sign that something is happening that shouldn't be. Also, the filenames like TurboStack.dll and ReserveManager.dll aren't ones I recognize as standard. Maybe they're part of a legitimate update, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point: the presence of multiple file creations in the same directory might indicate a large number of files being dropped, which could be part of a malicious payload. However, I should consider that this could be a legitimate update process, especially if the files are part of a known update. But since the user hasn't provided any additional context, I have to rely on the logs alone.\n\nThe classification is between INTERESTING and NOT INTERESTING. The key here is whether the events suggest potential malicious activity. Since svchost.exe is a common host for malicious processes, and the files created are in a directory typically used for updates but with unusual filenames, this might be worth investigating. However, without more indicators like network activity, unexpected processes, or anomalies in the registry changes, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nThe confidence level would depend on how unusual these events are. Creating multiple DLLs in Metadata under SoftwareDistribution by svchost.exe is not standard. While it could be a legitimate scenario, the lack of typical indicators (like known update files) and the presence of multiple such events might tip the scales towards INTERESTING. However, I'm not 100% sure, so maybe a moderate confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **File Creations in `SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Metadata`:**\n   - **svchost.exe** (a legitimate Windows process) is creating multiple DLLs (e.g., `UpdateAgent.dll`, `TurboStack.dll`, `ReserveManager.dll`) in the `Metadata` subdirectory of `SoftwareDistribution`. \n   - **Legitimate Context:** `SoftwareDistribution` is associated with Windows Update, but **Metadata** is typically used for temporary files, not DLLs. This pattern is unusual and could indicate:\n     - **Malicious payload staging** (e.g., dropping executable components).\n     - **Tampering** with the update process (e.g., hijacking Windows Update for malicious purposes).\n\n2. **Registry Value Set Events:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events by **svchost.exe** (no file paths provided). While registry modifications are common, the lack of context (e.g., specific keys\/paths) raises concerns about potential **configuration changes** or **Persistence mechanisms**.\n\n3. **Legitimate Components:**\n   - **`waasmedic.etl`** (a Windows Update diagnostic log) and **`edbtmp.log`** (part of the Windows Update database) are created by **svchost.exe**, which aligns with normal update operations.\n\n4. **Image Load Events:**\n   - References to **`urlmon.dll`** and **`BitsProxy.dll`** (both part of Windows) are expected and non-suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Suspicious Patterns:**\n  - Unusual file types (DLLs) in `Metadata`, which is not a standard location for such files.\n  - Repeated **svchost.exe** activity without clear correlation to known update processes.\n  - Lack of contextual clues (e.g., network activity, process tree, user context) to confirm legitimacy.\n\n- **Legitimate Possibilities:**\n  - A **custom update** or **third-party software** interacting with Windows Update.\n  - **Malware masquerading** as a legitimate update process.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs **merit further investigation** due to the **unusual file creation patterns** and **lack of clear context** for **svchost.exe** activity. While not definitively malicious, the combination of suspicious file paths and lack of typical update indicators raises **moderate concern**.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Additional Data:**\n   - Check for **network traffic** from `svchost.exe` (e.g., connections to unknown domains).\n   - Analyze **process tree** and **user context** (e.g., is this tied to a user account or system-level process?).\n   - Inspect **registry changes** for suspicious keys (e.g., persistence, driver loading).\n\n2. **File Analysis:**\n   - Use **hashing tools** (e.g., VirusTotal) to verify the legitimacy of files like `TurboStack.dll`.\n\n3. **System Monitoring:**\n   - Monitor **Windows Update logs** (`C:\\Windows\\Logs\\waasmedic`) for anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Classification:**\n- **Label:** `INTERESTING` (Potential indicator of compromise, but requires further analysis).\n- **Confidence:** **Medium** (Suspicious patterns observed, but no definitive malicious indicators)."}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe is creating files in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory. That's a common place for Windows Update files. The filenames look like random hashes, which might be part of a legitimate update process. But then there's a file created in the same directory named \"Install\" and then an executable called AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe. Hmm, delta patches are used in updates, but the name seems a bit generic. Maybe that's normal, but I should check if there's anything suspicious.\n\nNext, MpSigStub.exe is creating files in the Windows Temp directory. MpSigStub is related to Windows Defender, so that's part of the signature update process. The files created here have names that look like temporary files, which is normal. However, the presence of multiple file creations might be part of a legitimate update. But I need to check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating files in the Program Files (x86) directory for Microsoft EdgeCore. The files are ie_to_edge_stub.exe and cookie_exporter.exe. These could be part of a legitimate installation, but I should verify if these are known legitimate files. If they are, then it's okay. But if not, that's a red flag.\n\nLooking at the registry events, svchost.exe is setting registry values multiple times. That's a bit concerning because svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's modifying the registry in a way that's not typical, that could be malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe it's part of a normal update process.\n\nThe MsMpEng.exe process loading an image from the Defender definition updates is normal. That's part of the antivirus updating its definitions.\n\nNow, considering all the events together: multiple file creations in typical system directories by known processes (svchost, MpSigStub, setup), some registry changes, and temporary files. But the key point is that these activities are associated with Windows Update and Defender processes. However, the presence of multiple file creations and registry modifications could be part of a legitimate update, but could also be signs of a malicious activity if the files are not expected.\n\nWait, the AM_Delta_Patch file might be a delta patch from a legitimate update, but if that's not part of a scheduled update, it might be suspicious. Also, the setup.exe creating EdgeCore files might be part of a legitimate installation, but if that's not expected, it's a problem.\n\nAnother thing to note is that some of the files have names that look like they could be part of a malicious payload, like the random hash filenames. However, in the context of Windows Update, those are typically used for update packages.\n\nI need to check if there's any indication of unexpected processes or unusual file paths. The files are in standard directories, and the processes involved are legitimate. However, the volume of events might be higher than normal, but without comparing to baseline activity, it's hard to say.\n\nIn conclusion, while some of these activities are normal for system updates and antivirus operations, the combination of multiple file creations, registry modifications, and the presence of files in temp directories might warrant further investigation to ensure that no malicious activity is occurring under the guise of legitimate processes.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries depict a mix of **legitimate system activity** and **potential indicators of compromise (IoCs)** that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Processes and Activities**:\n   - **`svchost.exe`** and **`MpSigStub.exe`** are known components of Windows Update and Windows Defender, respectively. File creation in `SoftwareDistribution\\Download` and `Temp` directories is typical during updates.\n   - **`MsMpEng.exe`** (Windows Defender) loading `mpengine.dll` is a standard definition update process.\n   - **`setup.exe`** creating files in `Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeCore` aligns with legitimate Edge installation\/update activities.\n\n2. **Suspicious Patterns**:\n   - **Delta Patch File**: `AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe` in `SoftwareDistribution\\Download` is a **delta patch**, which is normal for updates. However, the filename lacks versioning typical of Microsoft updates (e.g., `KBxxxxxxx`), raising questions about its origin.\n   - **Unusual File Paths**: Files like `mpasdlta.vdm` and `1.429.372.0_to_1.429.388.0_mpavdlta.vdm._p` in the Temp directory are **not standard** for Windows Defender or legitimate updates. These filenames resemble **malware droppers** or **custom payloads**.\n   - **Registry Modifications**: Repeated `svchost.exe` registry writes (e.g., `ImageLoad`, `FileCreate`) could indicate **tampering** with system behavior, though this requires deeper analysis (e.g., checking registry keys modified).\n\n3. **Potential Malicious Activity**:\n   - **`setup.exe`** creating `ie_to_edge_stub.exe` and `cookie_exporter.exe` in `EdgeCore` could be **legitimate** (e.g., Edge integration), but these binaries are not widely documented as standard Edge components. Their presence might indicate **unauthorized installations** or **malware masquerading as Edge updates**.\n   - The use of **randomized filenames** (e.g., `11DD923E-C8CB-4A99-BDFC-5C6753417F12`) in Temp directories is common in **malware** to evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Correlate with Baseline Activity**: Check if the volume of file creations, registry changes, or process behavior deviates from historical norms.\n- **Analyze File Hashes**: Use tools like **Windows Defender ATP** or **Malware Analysis Platforms** to scan the suspicious files (e.g., `AM_Delta_Patch.exe`, `mpasdlta.vdm`) for malware signatures.\n- **Investigate `setup.exe`**: Verify the legitimacy of `setup.exe` (e.g., digital signature, parent process) and the binaries it installs.\n- **Monitor Temp Directories**: Unusual files in `Temp` (e.g., `.vdm`, `.p` files) should be flagged for deeper inspection.\n- **Check for Lateral Movement**: If `svchost.exe` is modifying registry keys related to network settings or user credentials, this could indicate **post-exploitation activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activities (e.g., Windows Update, Defender updates) are legitimate, the **unusual file paths**, **unrecognized binaries**, and **repeated registry modifications** suggest **potential malicious activity**. This log batch is **interesting for investigation** and requires further analysis to rule out compromise."}

That's a bit odd because setup.exe is usually a legitimate installer, but creating executables in the EdgeCore folder might not be standard. Maybe that's part of a legitimate installation, but I should keep that in mind.\n\nThen there's RuntimeBroker.exe modifying the registry. RuntimeBroker is a normal process for UAC, but if it's changing registry values, that could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Next, powershell.exe is being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, so that's a point of interest.\n\nLooking at the command line of one of the PowerShell processes: it's creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to a file in C:\\unidade_logico... That path doesn't look standard. The name \"objeto_ativo\" seems like a random or obfuscated name, which is a common tactic for malware. The service is then started, which could be a way to maintain persistence on the system.\n\nAnother PowerShell event creates a temporary script file in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp directory and then deletes it. That's a common evasion technique to avoid leaving traces. The script is named with a random string, which is suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .NET DLLs, which is normal, but when combined with the other actions, it might indicate something malicious. The tarefa_logico.exe process is loading mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are part of the .NET runtime. However, if this process was created by the PowerShell script, it could be part of a malicious payload.\n\nThe repeated Registry value set events from services.exe might be related to the new service created by PowerShell. If services.exe is modifying its own registry keys, that could be part of the persistence mechanism.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of a new service with a non-standard path, the use of PowerShell to execute scripts and delete them, the presence of suspicious file names, and the loading of DLLs from non-standard locations all point towards potential malicious activity. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events in a short period suggests that this is worth investigating further.

Not too worrying, but the next entry is a registry value set. Still, not immediately malicious.\n\nBut wait, here's a process with 'Execute a Remote Command' task pointing to 'componente_auxiliar.ps1'. That script is being imported multiple times in the command line. The path is in 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\', which seems like a custom directory, not a standard system path. That's a red flag.\n\nLooking further, the command line includes importing that module and running Invoke-entrada_principal with OutputDirectory set to $env:Temp. Then, after that, they start a service named 'objeto_ativo' with the binary path pointing to 'tarefa_logico.exe' in another custom directory. \n\nCreating a new service and starting it via PowerShell is unusual. The fact that the same script is being executed multiple times and the service is being created suggests potential malicious activity. The use of non-standard paths and the combination of registry changes, script execution, and service creation all point towards a possible compromise. \n\nThe confidence is high because the actions are not typical of normal operations.

The user provided a bunch of JSONL events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by looking through the data.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is using PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". The command is executed multiple times, and the winlog task is either \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\". That seems suspicious because creating a new service via PowerShell isn't normal unless it's part of a legitimate setup. But repeating this multiple times might indicate an attempt to persist or hide malicious activity.\n\nThen, there are several entries where the winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path is \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\". This script is being executed multiple times, which could be part of a larger attack. The fact that it's a remote command execution might mean that an attacker is running scripts on the system, which is a red flag.\n\nLooking at the other entries, there's a \"services.exe\" process with a \"Logon\" task. That might be normal, but if it's paired with other suspicious activities, it could be part of a compromise.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: creating a service with a custom executable, executing remote commands multiple times, and repeating the same commands several times. This pattern suggests that an attacker is trying to establish persistence on the system. The repetition of the same commands might be an attempt to bypass detection or ensure that the malicious service starts even if some attempts fail.\n\nThe confidence here is high because the combination of creating a service with a non-standard path, executing remote scripts multiple times, and the repetition of these actions are strong indicators of malicious behavior.

If this is a normal operation, maybe it's just a routine task. But executing a remote command via PowerShell scripts can be a red flag, especially if it's happening repeatedly. \n\nThe file path is in a directory named 'registro_secundario' which translates to 'secondary register'—maybe that's a red herring, but the name doesn't immediately suggest anything malicious. However, the script name 'componente_auxiliar.ps1' means 'auxiliary component', which is vague. Attackers sometimes use generic names to avoid detection.\n\nSince all the events are identical, it could be a sign of automation or a script that's being run multiple times. But without any variation, it's hard to tell if it's benign or malicious. However, the fact that the process is 'None' might be suspicious. Maybe the process isn't being logged properly, or it's a legitimate process that's not captured here. Alternatively, it could be an indicator of compromise if the process isn't being tracked.\n\nConsidering the task 'Execute a Remote Command' is a high-risk activity. If this is happening repeatedly from the same script, it might be part of a larger attack, like establishing a backdoor or executing commands on a remote server. The lack of process information could mean that the system isn't logging the process correctly, which is another concern.\n\nBut on the other hand, maybe this is a legitimate administrative task. However, without more context, like the source of the command, user involved, or other related events, it's hard to confirm. But given that all the logs are the same and the task is high-risk, it's worth investigating. \n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say around 0.75.
