{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and powershell.exe are involved in registry value sets. That's a common activity, but not necessarily malicious. Then there's calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Hmm, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but sometimes it can be used in malicious contexts. However, just loading it might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking further, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so that might be normal user activity. Then there's whoami.exe being executed, which is a standard command to get user info. Still benign so far.\n\nNow, I notice multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being used. The command line for one cmd.exe is deleting notepad.exe processes using wmic. That's a bit suspicious because deleting processes can be part of a cleanup routine by malware. Also, there's a WMIC.exe process that's loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Amsi is part of Windows Defender, but if it's being loaded by WMIC, that might be unusual. However, I should check if these are legitimate paths.\n\nWait, the paths for the DLLs loaded by WMIC are all legitimate system paths. Amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are part of Windows Defender. But why would WMIC be loading them? Maybe it's a false positive, or maybe there's something else going on. Also, the use of wmic to delete processes is a red flag. Typically, malware uses wmic to execute commands stealthily. The command line \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\" is a common technique used by malware to terminate processes, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with registry value sets. While registry changes can be normal, if it's part of a larger pattern of suspicious activity, it might indicate an attempt to modify system settings or evade detection. Also, the presence of multiple processes accessing each other could be part of a more complex attack.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to overinterpret. Some of these events could be part of normal user activities, like running whoami or using winlogbeat. But the combination of deleting processes via wmic, loading specific DLLs, and repeated registry changes might indicate a potential security incident. The confidence here is moderate because while there are suspicious elements, they aren't definitively malicious on their own. More context would be needed, but based on the given data, it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Use of wmic to delete notepad.exe processes (common in malware cleanup), 2) WMIC loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll (Windows Defender components, possibly bypassing protections), 3) Repeated registry modifications by multiple processes, and 4) PowerShell\/cmd.exe usage patterns that could indicate command execution or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not. The main thing is to look for any suspicious patterns that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of chrome.exe and conhost.exe, which are normal. But then there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which are often used in attacks. The events mention things like registry value sets and process accesses. \n\nWait, one of the cmd.exe entries has a command line that copies sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. That's a red flag. The sethc.exe is the Sticky Keys utility, and replacing it with a backup file could be part of a malicious payload, like a backdoor. Also, another cmd.exe command is deleting a scheduled task named win32times. That might be trying to remove evidence or prevent a task from running.\n\nThen there's the schtasks.exe process deleting the same task. Scheduled tasks being deleted or modified can be suspicious. Also, the image loaded event for taskschd.dll might be normal, but combined with other actions, it could be part of something malicious.\n\nThe whoami.exe is just getting user info, which is normal. But the combination of these commands and the registry changes might indicate someone is trying to modify system settings or escalate privileges. The repeated registry value sets could be part of configuring something malicious.\n\nI should check if there's a pattern of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms. The use of cmd and powershell to manipulate registry and scheduled tasks is common in attacks. The fact that multiple registry events are happening along with process creations might suggest an attacker is setting up persistence.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the presence of commands modifying system files, deleting scheduled tasks, and repeated registry changes could be signs of a malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) 'cmd.exe' executing 'copy \/Y C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\sethc.exe' (potential malicious replacement of system file). 2) 'cmd.exe' deleting scheduled task 'win32times' (possible evidence removal). 3) Repeated registry modifications and process access events involving PowerShell and cmd.exe, which are common in attack chains.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze all of them together and determine if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are a lot of process creations and accesses, mostly involving powershell.exe, cmd.exe, whoami.exe, chrome.exe, and conhost.exe. The winlog tasks include things like Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, and Image Load. \n\nHmm, I notice that powershell.exe is appearing multiple times. That's common in both legitimate and malicious activities. But looking further, there's an event where the file path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a process is loading this DLL, that's normal. But I also see another image load for mscoree.dll, which is related to .NET runtime. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nNow, checking the command lines. There's a command_line for whoami.exe, which is a standard command to get user info. But there's also a powershell.exe command with \"& {}\" which seems like an empty command. That might be a red flag if it's part of a larger payload or obfuscation. However, sometimes that's used in scripts for testing or other benign purposes.\n\nRegistry value set events are happening a lot. That could be normal, but if an attacker is modifying registry keys to persist or hide their activities, that's a problem. But without more context, like which registry keys are being modified, it's hard to say. \n\nThe repetition of Process Access events for powershell.exe might indicate that the process is being accessed multiple times, maybe by different processes or users. However, again, this could be normal if it's part of a script that's running multiple commands.\n\nAnother thing to check is if there's any unusual combination of events. For example, if there's a process creation followed by accessing a sensitive file or registry key. But in the given data, the only file mentioned is amsi.dll and mscoree.dll, both of which are legitimate. \n\nWait, but why is there an Image Load event for amsi.dll? That's part of the system's security features. If an attacker is trying to disable amsi, they might load it in a way that bypasses detection. However, the event just says it's loaded, not modified or disabled. So maybe that's not suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command_line for powershell.exe: \"& {}\" is an empty command. That's a bit odd. Maybe it's a placeholder or part of a larger command that's been truncated. If that's the case, it could be a sign of obfuscation or a way to avoid detection. But without more data, it's hard to confirm.\n\nAlso, the repeated use of ProcessCreate and ProcessAccess for powershell.exe might indicate that it's being used to execute commands, which is common in both legitimate and malicious scenarios. However, the lack of other indicators like network activity, file modifications, or unusual registry changes makes it harder to determine.\n\nPutting it all together: there are some suspicious elements like the empty powershell command and multiple registry changes, but none of the events point directly to a clear attack. The presence of legitimate processes and files makes it possible that this is just normal system activity. However, the combination of repeated powershell accesses and registry modifications could be indicative of something more. \n\nI think the confidence here is moderate. It's not a clear-cut attack, but there are enough anomalies that warrant further investigation. So the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe process accesses and registry modifications, along with an unusual empty command line in PowerShell, suggest potential malicious activity.

So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several entries related to PowerShell.exe. The first few events mention image loaded for .NET DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. Creating and deleting a script file might be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use temp files to execute malicious scripts. However, since it's deleted afterward, it could be a red herring or part of a test.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries with command_line 'powershell.exe & {}' and tasks like Provider Lifecycle or Engine Lifecycle. Those might be part of PowerShell's normal operation, but the repetition could be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a known location for PowerShell profiles, so maybe that's legitimate. The registry value set events and process access events are also common, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThere are also a few instances where PowerShell is checking for the existence of certain .bat files. The paths here are a bit odd with the '..\\' which might indicate directory traversal, but again, it could be part of a script checking for files in parent directories. The commands are exiting 0 or 1 based on whether the file exists. That might be part of a legitimate script, but if those .bat files are malicious, that could be an issue. However, the logs don't show the content of those .bat files, so it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for monitoring logs, so that's probably normal. The other events involving conhost.exe and whoami.exe are also standard processes.\n\nPutting it all together: There are some suspicious activities like temporary file creation and deletion, checking for .bat files, but none of the events clearly indicate a security threat. The majority of the logs seem to be normal PowerShell operations. However, the repeated events and the file operations in temp directories might warrant further investigation.

The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. The command lines are similar, checking if certain .bat files exist and exiting with 0 or 1. These paths have some common elements like \"modulo_ativo\", \"componente_temporario\", \"estrutura_geral\", etc. The use of \"..\" in the paths might be a red flag, as it could indicate directory traversal or trying to access files outside the intended directory. \n\nThen there are events related to file creation and deletion. A temporary file is created and then deleted, which is normal for some scripts, but combined with the PowerShell commands, it might be part of a larger process. Also, there's a file created in the Downloads folder, which could be benign, but if it's part of a download, maybe not. \n\nThe Image Load events mention .NET DLLs, which are normal for PowerShell, but not suspicious on their own. The Chrome events are about registry changes, but repeated registry value sets might be normal if Chrome is updating settings, but without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe Pipe Created event is also normal, but again, not suspicious by itself. \n\nHowever, the repeated PowerShell commands checking for specific .bat files in paths that use \"..\" could be part of a script trying to locate or execute files in parent directories, which might be a technique used by malware to evade detection. The fact that there are multiple similar PowerShell commands with different paths might indicate a pattern, possibly automated or part of a larger attack. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. The events alone don't show obvious malicious activity like downloading malware or executing harmful code, but the pattern of checking for files in parent directories and the number of similar events could be suspicious. However, without more context like the actual content of the .bat files or other indicators of compromise, it's hard to be certain. \n\nSo, the justification would be the repeated PowerShell commands with directory traversal and the multiple file creation\/deletion events.

So, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking through the events, most of them involve PowerShell processes. There's a lot of activity related to file creation and registry changes. Let me check each entry one by one.\n\nThe first event is a PowerShell command checking if a specific file exists. It's using Test-Path and exiting 0 or 1 based on that. Not sure yet if that's suspicious, but maybe part of a script.\n\nThen there's a file created in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for legitimate scripts, but sometimes malware uses similar paths. Not conclusive yet.\n\nNext, there's a registry value set. PowerShell can modify the registry, which isn't inherently bad, but could be part of persistence mechanisms if done without user consent.\n\nLooking further, several process creation events with PowerShell. The command lines show New-Item and Set-Content commands. These are creating batch files and setting their content to \"dir\". That seems odd because \"dir\" is a basic command, but creating multiple files across different paths might be an attempt to leave backdoors or execute commands later.\n\nThere are also image loaded events for .NET DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell, but the frequency might be worth noting. However, the main concern here is the file creation and modification.\n\nThe repeated pattern of creating batch files in various directories with \"dir\" as content could be a red flag. If an attacker is creating multiple scripts across the system, that might be part of establishing persistence or executing commands. However, the content being \"dir\" is a simple command, which might not be malicious on its own. But the number of such events and the use of PowerShell to create them could indicate something more.\n\nI should also consider the tasks mentioned in the winlog. Tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' might be part of legitimate processes, but combined with the file creation and registry changes, it might be suspicious.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The actions are all within the capabilities of PowerShell for legitimate scripting. The lack of other indicators like network activity, unauthorized access, or known malicious binaries makes it harder to classify as definitely interesting.\n\nBut the sheer number of file creations and the use of PowerShell in a way that's creating multiple scripts might be worth further investigation.

Then there's a file created in the Temp directory, which is common for malware to drop files. But then it's deleted, which might be a cleanup. The next events show PowerShell loading various DLLs, like MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's normal, but maybe if it's unexpected? Also, there are multiple instances of Test-Path commands checking for specific bat files. These paths have some odd structures with ..\\\\ which might be trying to access parent directories, possibly to evade detection or manipulate paths.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell to create and delete files, along with checking for the existence of certain scripts, could indicate some form of automated task or maybe even a script that's trying to execute in a stealthy manner.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing some system event. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them are about PowerShell processes running commands that check if certain files exist. The command lines all use Test-Path to check for specific executable files in various directories. The exit codes are 0 or 1 based on whether the file exists. \n\nNow, why would that be suspicious? Well, PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, but when it's used in a way that's checking for specific files, especially in non-standard directories, it might be part of a larger process. The fact that these checks are repeated multiple times with different file paths could indicate that the attacker is verifying the presence of malicious binaries in different locations. \n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, most are related to process creation, image loading, and file operations. The 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks might be part of some software's normal operation, but the repeated checks for files in 'bin' directories could be a red flag. \n\nI also notice that some entries have the 'file' field with paths like 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\mscoree.dll' or .NET Framework DLLs. Those are legitimate, but the presence of temporary files being created and deleted, like the '__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1' script, might be part of a script that's being executed and then cleaned up, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious. Some of these could be normal operations, like checking if a file exists before executing it. But the pattern here is that each entry is checking for a different executable in different directories. That might be part of a larger attack where the attacker is trying to determine if certain payloads are present, or perhaps they're part of a staged attack where each component is checked in sequence.\n\nAnother thing is the use of 'exit 0' and 'exit 1' based on the file's existence. This could be a way to determine if a previous step was successful, or maybe to check for the presence of a file before proceeding with an action. If these checks are part of a malicious script, they might be used to conditionally execute further commands.\n\nBut wait, the user said to consider the entire batch as a whole. All these events are about checking the existence of various .exe files. If they're all part of a single process or script, that might be a sign of malicious activity. However, without seeing more context, like the actual execution of those files or network activity, it's a bit hard to tell. But the fact that so many of these checks are happening in different directories and with different file names could be a red flag.\n\nAlso, the presence of the 'Pipe Created' event might be part of inter-process communication, which could be normal, but combined with the other events, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nOn the other hand, if these are all part of a legitimate application's setup process, they might not be malicious. But the repetition and the specific way the files are checked (with 'Test-Path') might not be standard in many legitimate applications. \n\nIn the absence of other clear indicators like network connections or unauthorized access, the main red flags here are the numerous file existence checks in non-standard locations and the creation\/deletion of temporary scripts. That's why I think this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided batch of system events warrants investigation due to the following patterns and potential indicators of suspicious activity:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repeated PowerShell `Test-Path` Checks:**\n   - Multiple entries involve PowerShell commands checking for the existence of specific `.exe` files in non-standard directories (e.g., `C:\\registro_principal\\...`, `C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\...`). \n   - Example:  \n     ```powershell\n     if (Test-Path \"C:\\registro_principal\\registro_temporario\\registro_secundario\\bin\\componente_secundario.exe\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }\n     ```\n   - **Why Suspicious?**  \n     Such checks are often used in malicious scripts to verify the presence of payloads or prerequisites before proceeding with further actions (e.g., execution, data exfiltration).\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1`) is created in the user's `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory and immediately deleted.  \n   - **Why Suspicious?**  \n     This behavior is common in malware to avoid leaving traces on the system. The filename suggests it might be related to script policy testing, which could be a misdirection.\n\n3. **File and Pipe Events:**\n   - Events like `File created`, `File Delete logged`, and `Pipe Created` are logged, indicating potential transient or stealthy operations.  \n   - **Why Suspicious?**  \n     The creation\/deletion of temporary files and pipes could be part of a larger process to execute payloads in memory or communicate between processes without persistent artifacts.\n\n4. **Engine\/Provider Lifecycle Events:**\n   - Some entries reference `Engine Lifecycle` or `Provider Lifecycle` tasks, which might relate to software components (e.g., plugins, services). However, the lack of context makes it unclear whether these are legitimate or part of an attack chain.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Unusual File Paths:** The checked `.exe` files are in directories with names like `registro_principal`, `objeto_auxiliar`, or `componente_secundario`, which may be obfuscated or part of a non-standard application.\n- **Lateral Movement:** The repeated checks for files in different directories could indicate an attempt to locate or deploy malicious components across the system.\n- **Script Obfuscation:** The use of temporary scripts and their deletion suggests an effort to evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n- **Correlate with Network Activity:** Check if any of these events coincide with network connections to external IPs or domains.\n- **Analyze PowerShell Scripts:** Recover or analyze the deleted temporary script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1`) for malicious content.\n- **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:** Investigate if the system has scheduled tasks, registry keys, or services that could be tied to these PowerShell commands.\n- **Review File Integrity:** Use tools like `Get-FileHash` to verify the integrity of the `.exe` files referenced in the `Test-Path` commands.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the logs do not definitively prove malicious activity, the combination of repeated file existence checks, temporary script creation\/deletion, and lack of clear context strongly suggests this warrants further investigation. The behavior aligns with techniques used in advanced persistent threats (APTs) or malware to probe the environment and execute payloads stealthily."}

That's part of Windows Defender. Hmm, maybe legitimate, but sometimes malware can masquerade as legitimate files. But I need to check more.\n\nThen there are several entries of 'Registry value set' and 'Process accessed' by powershell.exe. These are common in normal operations, but if they're happening excessively or in a suspicious pattern, that could be a red flag. However, just seeing these alone might not be enough.\n\nLooking further, there's a file created at 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive' in the user's AppData. That's a bit odd because PowerShell startup profiles are usually in specific locations, but maybe it's a legitimate configuration. However, the presence of such a file might be normal, but combined with other events?\n\nThen there are multiple 'Process accessed' events. The user is running whoami.exe and cmd.exe, which are standard utilities. But the command line for cmd.exe checks if a file exists in the temp directory. That could be part of a script checking for a file, which might be benign, but sometimes attackers use similar tactics to check for the presence of files before proceeding.\n\nWait, the command line for one of the powershell.exe processes is checking if a file exists at 'C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\estrutura_comum\\src\\estrutura_temporario.cs'. The path has some non-English terms like 'pacote_ativo' which might be Portuguese for 'active package'. That's a bit suspicious. Maybe the attacker is using obfuscated paths or trying to hide their activities. Also, the fact that they're checking for the existence of a .cs file (C# source code) might indicate that they're looking for something specific, possibly part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of events. There are multiple 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events from powershell.exe. While PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, excessive or unusual activity could indicate script-based attacks. Also, the presence of 'Image loaded' for mscoree.dll (which is related to .NET runtime) might be normal, but combined with other events, it's worth noting.\n\nHowever, there's also the fact that one of the processes is loading 'MpClient.dll' from Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's just normal Defender operations. But if that's the only one, maybe not. However, the other events could be more suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of multiple PowerShell events, checking for specific files in non-standard paths, and the use of command-line checks might indicate an attempt to probe the system or execute scripts. The presence of 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive' might be a red herring, but the other events, especially the ones with the Portuguese-like paths, could be part of a malicious activity. However, without more context or additional suspicious events (like network connections, unexpected file modifications, or privilege escalation), it's a bit ambiguous. But given the repeated access and registry changes, along with the unusual file path checks, I'd lean towards classifying this as interesting for further investigation, though not 100% certain. Confidence around 0.7 maybe.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events with registry modifications, process access, and file creation in non-standard paths (e.g., 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive').

So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: they mention PowerShell.exe loading clr.dll and clrjit.dll from the .NET Framework directory. Those are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. But then there's a bunch of PowerShell commands that check if certain .cs files exist. The paths here are all in directories like C:\\registro_principal, C:\\modulo_secundario, etc. These don't look like standard system paths. The command lines are using Test-Path to check for these files and exiting with 0 or 1. That might be part of a script that's checking for the presence of specific files, which could be benign, but maybe part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nThen there's an entry about creating and deleting a temporary PowerShell script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Creating and deleting files is common, but the fact that it's done in a way that's logged might be suspicious. Also, the script is named __PSScriptPolicyTest... which might be a test, but sometimes attackers use similar names to hide malicious scripts.\n\nAnother event mentions a pipe created, which could be normal, but sometimes used in attacks. Then, there are several entries with Engine Lifecycle and Provider Lifecycle tasks, which are part of PowerShell's event logging. However, the repeated checking for specific .cs files in non-standard paths might indicate that the attacker is looking for certain files that could be part of a payload or configuration.\n\nLooking at the confidence: the presence of multiple Test-Path commands for non-existent files (since they exit 1 if the file isn't found) might be probing the system for specific files. The creation and deletion of temporary scripts could be part of an attempt to execute malicious code. However, without more context like actual malicious activity or known bad indicators, it's a bit ambiguous. But the combination of these events does raise some flags.

The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking through the entries, I notice that PowerShell.exe is involved in multiple events. There are several instances where PowerShell is accessing processes, and there's a recurring pattern with the command line checking for the existence of a file named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. The command lines are structured similarly, using Test-Path to check if the script exists and then exiting with 0 or 1. \n\nWait, the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is a red flag. That script name is commonly associated with keylogging malware. Even though the commands here are just checking if the file exists and not executing it, the fact that multiple processes are checking for this script in different directories might indicate an attempt to locate or deploy malicious software. \n\nAlso, there are events related to registry value changes and process access, which could be part of an attack chain. The image loaded events include mscoree.dll and MpOAV.dll. While these are legitimate files, their loading in the context of PowerShell might be suspicious if they're not expected. However, the main concern here is the repeated checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. This could be a sign of temporary malicious activity, like downloading a script, executing it, and then cleaning up. However, in this case, the file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1, which might be related to PowerShell script policy testing, but combined with the other events, it's still suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths, along with the PowerShell events and file operations, suggest that this might be part of an attack. The confidence level is high because the script name is a known malicious indicator, even though the commands here don't execute the script. However, the pattern of checking for it in multiple locations could be part of a larger malicious plan. So, the classification is INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes are checking for the existence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' across various paths, a common indicator of keylogging malware.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user wants me to analyze all these events together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are several entries related to PowerShell.exe. The first event mentions that the process 'powershell.exe' loaded an image from the path 'C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpClient.dll'. Wait, that's a legitimate Windows Defender file. Maybe that's normal, but I should check if there are any other suspicious activities around that.\n\nThen there's a file created event for 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive' in the user's AppData. That might be normal too, but sometimes attackers use startup scripts to persist. However, just creating a file there might not be enough to flag it unless there's more.\n\nNext, there are several 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events for PowerShell and other processes. These could be normal operations, but if they're part of a larger pattern, like trying to modify registry keys or access processes, that might be suspicious. However, on its own, these events don't necessarily indicate a threat.\n\nThere's also a 'whoami.exe' process being created, which is a standard command to check user context. That's usually benign. The 'calc.exe' event is loading 'urlmon.dll', which is a legitimate system file. No obvious issues there.\n\nLooking at the network connections, there are multiple entries for 'chrome.exe' and 'svchost.exe' making network connections. Chrome is a common browser, so it's expected to have network activity. 'svchost.exe' hosting services might also be normal. However, if there's a high volume or unusual destinations, that could be a red flag. But in this case, the events just mention network connections without specific details like IP addresses or ports, so it's hard to tell.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory might be part of a log collection tool, which is normal if it's a legitimate installation. But if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something else. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these events seem to be normal system activities. There's no clear evidence of malicious behavior like unauthorized access, unusual file modifications, or suspicious network traffic to known malicious IPs. The PowerShell activities don't seem to be doing anything out of the ordinary. The only thing that stands out is the 'StartupProfileData' file, but that alone isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nTherefore, I think this batch is not interesting for investigation because there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The events are consistent with normal user and system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily reflect normal system operations (e.g., legitimate process executions, file creation in user directories, and standard network activity).

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are multiple entries of ProcessAccess, ProcessCreate, and Registry value set. Then there's some ImageLoad events pointing to system files like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of .NET. Also, there's a File created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The command lines show PowerShell commands that are listing files recursively, which might be normal, but combined with other events could be suspicious.\n\nWait, the FileCreate and FileDelete events involve a temporary script file. That's common in some legitimate scenarios, but if it's being created and immediately deleted, maybe it's trying to hide something. Also, the repeated Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events might be part of a script that's running multiple times.\n\nLooking at the ImageLoad events, the paths are system-related, like Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. Loading these might be normal, but if there's an unusual number of loads or from unexpected sources, that's a red flag. However, in this case, the paths are legitimate.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe is a standard command to get user info, so that's probably normal. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell events, especially with registry changes and file operations, might indicate someone is trying to modify system settings or execute scripts.\n\nBut wait, the user also has a winlogbeat.exe event creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be part of a legitimate monitoring setup. However, the .yml.new file suggests a configuration change, which could be normal if it's part of an update or setup.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell activities, some registry changes, file creation and deletion, and loading of system DLLs. While some of these are normal, the combination could indicate a script that's performing actions that are either benign or potentially malicious. However, without more context like unusual network activity or unexpected user behavior, it's a bit ambiguous. But the fact that there's a temporary script file created and deleted, along with repeated PowerShell commands, might be worth investigating further.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a series of JSON log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at each event.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe running with a command line that includes ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, and gci -recurse. These are all PowerShell commands to list files recursively. The task is 'Engine Lifecycle'. Not sure what that means yet, but the command itself might be normal or could be part of something malicious. Maybe the user is just exploring the file system, but maybe it's part of a data exfiltration attempt.\n\nSecond event: File created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. The process is powershell.exe. Creating a startup profile could be normal, but sometimes attackers create persistence mechanisms here. Need to check if this is a legitimate path or if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nThird event: Registry value set by powershell.exe. Registry changes can be part of malware persistence. But without knowing the specific key or value, it's hard to tell. Maybe benign, maybe not.\n\nFourth event: conhost.exe (which is the console host process for Windows) also setting a registry value. This might be part of normal operations, but could also be a red flag if it's modifying unexpected registry keys. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nFifth event: File created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\estrutura_secundario.txt'. The process is powershell.exe. Creating a file in the Downloads folder might be normal, but the name 'estrutura_secundario.txt' doesn't immediately ring any bells. Could be a legitimate file or part of an attack.\n\nSixth event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own data directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a new config file might be part of its normal operation, especially if it's being configured. But the presence of a .new file might indicate a configuration change, which could be benign or malicious depending on context.\n\nSeventh event: powershell.exe accessing a process. The 'Process accessed' event might indicate that PowerShell is interacting with another process. This could be normal, but if it's accessing processes that are not typically accessed, it might be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the multiple PowerShell activities, creation of files in potentially sensitive directories (like StartupProfileData), registry modifications, and the creation of a file named 'estrutura_secundario.txt'. However, without more context like the content of the files, the specific registry keys modified, or the overall behavior of the user, it's challenging. But the combination of PowerShell commands that list files recursively, creating files in system directories, and registry changes could indicate an investigation is warranted. The confidence might be around 0.65 because there are enough suspicious elements but not definitive proof of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities involving file listing, registry modifications, and file creation in system directories (e.g., StartupProfileData-NonInteractive) suggest potential malicious behavior or system enumeration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
