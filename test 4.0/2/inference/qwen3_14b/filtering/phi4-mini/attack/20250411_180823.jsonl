{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not a red flag yet. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that might be okay, but notepad.exe modifying the registry is a bit odd. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a legitimate tool. The key here is to check for unusual commands or parameters. But in the logs provided, the command lines aren't detailed enough except for a few cases.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes creating scheduled tasks. The command line shows creating tasks named \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\" with actions that run calc.exe. That's odd because calc.exe is a harmless calculator, but creating multiple scheduled tasks with such names might be a sign of something malicious. Also, the tasks are set to run on logon and startup, which could be a way to persist after a reboot.\n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe creating a task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same calc.exe command. This repetition of task creation with similar names and using calc.exe might be a red flag. Even though calc.exe is benign, the pattern here could indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities under innocuous commands.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file created at 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup'. The System32 directory is a common place for legitimate system files, but creating tasks there could be suspicious if done by an unauthorized process. The file path suggests it's part of a scheduled task, which aligns with the earlier schtasks commands.\n\nThe other events involve svchost.exe and conhost.exe modifying the registry. Svchost is a standard Windows process, but excessive registry changes could indicate something's wrong. However, without more context on what specific registry keys are being modified, it's hard to be certain.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious parts are the multiple scheduled task creations with similar names and the use of calc.exe, which might be a decoy. The repetition and the specific naming pattern (\"_005_OnLogon\", \"_005_OnStartup\") suggest a possible automated or scripted attack. Even though individual components like chrome.exe and svchost.exe are normal, the combination of creating multiple scheduled tasks and the use of cmd.exe with schtasks might indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious code under the guise of harmless commands.\n\nThe confidence here is moderate because while the actions are not definitively malicious, the pattern and the use of scheduled tasks for such commands are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious scheduled task creations (e.g., 'elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon', 'modulo_principal_005_OnStartup') with calc.exe as the trigger, and repeated registry modifications by non-system processes. The pattern suggests potential persistence mechanism setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there's ApplicationFrameHost.exe and powershell.exe doing registry value sets. Then, chrome.exe is involved in several registry events, a pipe created, and image loaded. One of the image loaded events points to amsi.dll, which is a legitimate Windows file, but sometimes malware might try to load their own versions. However, the path here is C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll, which seems correct.\n\nThen there's a file created event for unidade_ativo.txt in the Downloads folder. That's a user-created file, maybe just a normal download. But the fact that powershell.exe is involved in creating it could be a red flag if it's part of a larger malicious activity. However, on its own, it's not necessarily bad.\n\nLooking at the process accesses for chrome.exe and powershell.exe. Multiple registry changes by chrome.exe might be normal, but if it's doing a lot of registry modifications, that could be suspicious. However, chrome does sometimes modify the registry for its own settings.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is a standard utility to check user context, so that's probably benign. The command line shows it's being run directly from the system32 directory, which is normal.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. There's a lot of activity from chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times. While some of that is normal, excessive registry changes could indicate something like a configuration change or potential malware. However, the presence of amsi.dll being loaded is legitimate. The file creation by powershell.exe is not inherently malicious, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like downloading or executing malicious files, that would be a problem. However, in this batch, there's no indication of execution of the downloaded file, just creation.\n\nAnother point is that powershell.exe is involved in several events, including registry changes and process access. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. But without more context, like script execution or suspicious commands, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe classification here is tricky. The events don't show clear signs of a security breach, but there's enough activity that might warrant further investigation. However, since the user is asking for a classification based on the entire batch, and there's no direct evidence of malicious activity (like unauthorized access, execution of malicious files, or clear indicators of compromise), it might be on the edge. However, the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe and the use of PowerShell could be considered suspicious enough to flag as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and powershell.exe, combined with a file creation event in the user's Downloads directory, suggest potential malicious activity or system compromise warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
