The first thing I notice is the Microsoft Edge setup file being created in the Program Files directory. That's a legitimate location, but the fact that the file creation time was changed might be suspicious. Then there's the CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll and taskschd.dll. Those are normal system files, but the process name CompatTelRunner.exe isn't something I recognize as standard. Maybe it's a legitimate process, but I should check if it's expected here.\n\nNext, there's a setup.exe creating a pipe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious. The services.exe logon events are normal, as are the user account management events. The WindowsUpdate.etl file being created is part of the update process, so that's probably benign.\n\nThe PowerShell command is interesting. It's scanning INF files for specific sections, which might be looking for installation scripts. But why would someone do that? Maybe it's part of a legitimate update or installation process. However, the command is run with Restricted execution policy, which might be a red flag if it's trying to bypass that. The creation of the StartupProfileData file is normal for PowerShell.\n\nChrome's DNS query and registry changes are typical for a browser. Winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file is part of its configuration, so that's probably okay. The MpCmdRun.exe events relate to Windows Defender, which is expected. The deletion of the Edge installer file in the Temp directory is normal after installation.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these events seem legitimate. The setup.exe and CompatTelRunner.exe activities don't immediately look malicious. However, the combination of file creation time changes, unusual process names, and PowerShell scanning might indicate something fishy. But without more evidence like unexpected network activity or unauthorized access, it's hard to confirm. The confidence is moderate, so I'd say it's interesting but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities observed: 1) Edge installer file with modified creation time in Program Files, 2) CompatTelRunner.exe loading system DLLs (amsi.dll, taskschd.dll) which may indicate process injection, 3) PowerShell scanning INF files for defaultinstall sections which could be probing for system configuration details.

The files are all in the node_modules directory under a specific path.\n\nHmm, first thought: git.exe is a normal process used for version control. When you clone a repository or pull changes, Git creates a lot of files, especially in node_modules if it's a JavaScript project. The files listed here seem like typical project files—like package.json, license, readme.md, and various configuration files like .travis.yml and Jenkinsfile. These are common in software projects, especially open-source ones.\n\nLooking at the paths, they all start with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\.

The key here is to determine if the events indicate any malicious activity. Since all the files are created by git.exe, which is a legitimate process, and the files are standard for a software project, there's no obvious sign of malware or unauthorized activity. \n\nBut wait, sometimes attackers might use Git to exfiltrate data or inject malicious code. However, in this case, the events don't show any unusual patterns. There's no mention of unexpected file types, unusual process behavior, or access to sensitive directories. The user might be working on a project that's pulling in many dependencies, which is normal.\n\nAnother angle: are there too many files being created in a short time? The logs show multiple files, but without timestamps, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that all events are from git.exe and the files are in node_modules points towards a legitimate operation. \n\nSo, the classification here would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities are consistent with normal Git operations during a project setup or dependency installation.
