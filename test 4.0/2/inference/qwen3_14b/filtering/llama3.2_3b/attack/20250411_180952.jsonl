{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first thing I notice is the presence of several processes that are typically benign, like svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe, which are part of Windows system services and logging tools. However, there are some other processes that stand out.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a cmd.exe process that's adding a user named \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" to a domain and adding them to the Domain Admins group. That's a red flag because creating domain admin accounts is a significant security risk. The use of such a strong password might be a temporary measure, but the act of adding a user to Domain Admins is suspicious, especially if it's done by an unauthorized process.\n\nAnother cmd.exe instance is using net1.exe to add another user, \"unidade_comum_Admin\", and then another command with net.exe to add \"modulo_comum_Admin\" to the Domain Admins group. The presence of multiple commands adding users to Domain Admins suggests potential privilege escalation or unauthorized administrative access. The use of net1.exe instead of the standard net.exe might indicate a modified or malicious version of the tool, which is a concern.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and process access events. While PowerShell is a common tool for administrators, its frequent use in these logs, especially without clear justification, could indicate automated scripts or malicious activities. The combination of these user additions and process accesses might be part of a larger attack, such as setting up backdoors or preparing for lateral movement within the network.\n\nThe logs also mention a file creation by svchost.exe, which is normal, but the other file creation by winlogbeat.exe seems related to configuration changes, which might be legitimate but could also be part of an attack if the configuration is being tampered with. However, the main concern here is the unauthorized addition of domain admin accounts and the use of command-line tools to manipulate user groups.\n\nConsidering all these points, the activities logged here are highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious behavior aimed at gaining elevated privileges within the domain. Therefore, this batch of events is relevant for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin accounts via 'net' and 'net1' commands, potential privilege escalation through user addition to 'Domain Admins' group, and repeated PowerShell\/process access events that may indicate malicious automation or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
