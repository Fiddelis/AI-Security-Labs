The majority of them involve the SDXHelper.exe process creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames are all JavaScript files with minified names, which might be normal for some Office add-ins or resources. However, the repetition of the same file being created multiple times, like officeaicopilot-strings.min_0baa481369488cbce9c3d5207010a50d.js appearing twice, could indicate something unusual. Also, there's a mention of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory, which might be part of a configuration change. But the main concern here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe. Since SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, maybe it's just updating resources, but the pattern of multiple identical files might suggest a potential issue, like a malware trying to drop files or a legitimate process behaving unexpectedly. However, without more context or known malicious activity, it's hard to say. The other events, like the Security Group Management and the winlogbeat file creation, don't seem immediately suspicious. I'd need to check if these files are part of a known Office update or if there's any other suspicious activity linked to them.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** Low Suspicion (Requires Further Investigation)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation Activity:**\n   - **Frequency:** Multiple entries show `SDXHelper.exe` creating JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_*.js`) in the `Microsoft Office SolutionPackages` directory. Some files (e.g., `min_0baa481369488cbce9c3d5207010a50d.js`) are logged multiple times.\n   - **Context:** `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft Office process associated with managing add-ins and resources. The filenames suggest they may be part of localized or minified resource files for Office applications (e.g., `officeaicopilot` could relate to AI-powered features like Copilot).\n   - **Anomaly:** While repetitive file creation could indicate a benign update or caching mechanism, the identical filenames being logged multiple times might warrant scrutiny. This could potentially indicate:\n     - **Legitimate Behavior:** Office updates or resource preloading.\n     - **Potential Concern:** If the files are not part of a known Office release, this could hint at tampering or unauthorized activity.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat File Creation:**\n   - A `winlogbeat.yml.new` file is created in the `Downloads` directory by `winlogbeat.exe`, a legitimate tool for log collection. This is likely part of a configuration change or setup process and is not inherently suspicious.\n\n3. **Security Group Management Event:**\n   - A log entry under \"Security Group Management\" with no process or file context is neutral and may relate to AD or system group changes. No immediate threat detected.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- **Verify File Legitimacy:** Check the hash of the created JavaScript files against Microsoft's known good files or use tools like [Microsoft Defender](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/security\/blog) for validation.\n- **Monitor SDXHelper.exe:** Use process monitoring tools to confirm that `SDXHelper.exe` is not interacting with unexpected networks or modifying system files outside the `SolutionPackages` directory.\n- **Review Winlogbeat Configuration:** Ensure the `winlogbeat.yml.new` file is part of a legitimate configuration update and not a result of unauthorized changes.\n\n**Conclusion:** The activity is likely benign (related to Office resource management), but the repetitive file creation warrants further investigation to rule out anomalies. No direct evidence of malware is present in the logs provided."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there's a bunch of events here, all related to file creation and a registry value set. The main process involved is SDXHelper.exe, which is creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. Then there are two entries involving chrome.exe setting registry values.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's normal here. SDXHelper.exe – I'm not too familiar with that process. Maybe it's part of some software, but I should check if it's a legitimate process. However, the user didn't mention any malware, so maybe it's part of a legitimate application. But creating so many JS files in that directory might be unusual. Office typically doesn't generate a lot of JS files in SolutionPackages unless there's some custom add-in or something. But then again, maybe it's part of an update or installation process.\n\nWait, the files are named officeaicopilot-strings.min.js. That seems like it could be related to some AI copilot feature, maybe a language pack or localization files. But why so many? If it's part of an installation, maybe it's downloading resources. However, the fact that there are duplicates (like the same file being created multiple times) might be a red flag. Also, the registry events from chrome.exe – setting registry values could be normal if it's part of an extension or update, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut considering the sheer number of file creations by SDXHelper.exe, that's a lot. If this is part of a legitimate process, there might be a reason, but it's possible that this is part of a malicious activity. For example, downloading payloads or setting up configuration files. The registry changes by chrome.exe might be related to that as well, maybe modifying settings to persist or communicate with a C2 server.\n\nHowever, without more information, like the source of the files, any network activity, or user interaction, it's hard to be certain. But in a security context, this kind of behavior would raise flags. The fact that the same file is created multiple times could indicate an attempt to overwrite or ensure that the file is present, which is common in malware. Also, the combination of file creation and registry changes might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to assume malice. Maybe the user is running some legitimate software that's doing this. However, given that there's no obvious benign reason for creating so many JS files in that directory, and the lack of user interaction mentioned, it's more likely suspicious. So, the answer would be that this is likely malicious activity, but further analysis is needed to confirm.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a series of file creation events by **`SDXHelper.exe`** and registry modifications by **`chrome.exe`**. Here's a breakdown of the key observations and potential implications:\n\n### **Key Findings**\n1. **High Volume of File Creations by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is creating multiple **`.min.js`** files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js`) in the **`Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`** directory. \n   - **Duplicates** of the same file are created (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_499ca2f99a6c0438b4bf6156bb7f6036.js` appears twice).\n   - **`officeaicopilot`** suggests a potential link to AI\/ML features (e.g., Copilot), but the repetitive and voluminous file creation is unusual for legitimate software.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications by `chrome.exe`:**\n   - **`chrome.exe`** is setting registry values (e.g., `RegistryEvent`). While Chrome extensions or updates may modify the registry, this alone is not inherently suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Unusual Behavior by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n  - The **repetitive creation of files** in a system directory (e.g., `SolutionPackages`) could indicate **malicious activity**, such as:\n    - **Payload delivery** (e.g., downloading and storing malicious code).\n    - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., creating files to evade detection).\n    - **Misconfiguration** or **legitimate software bugs** (though unlikely without user context).\n\n- **Lack of Clear Legitimacy:**\n  - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is not a widely recognized legitimate process. If this is part of an unknown application, it raises suspicion.\n  - The **`.min.js`** files are typical of **web assets**, but their placement on the file system (not in a browser cache or app data directory) is atypical.\n\n- **Combination of File and Registry Activity:**\n  - The **`chrome.exe`** registry events could be unrelated, but the combination with `SDXHelper.exe`'s activity might suggest **coordinated behavior** (e.g., a malware component interacting with Chrome or exploiting it).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Check if the process is associated with known software (e.g., via **Process Explorer**, **Malwarebytes**, or **VirusTotal**).\n   - Analyze the file contents (e.g., using **strings** or **PE analyzers**) to determine if they contain malicious code.\n\n2. **Monitor Network Activity:**\n   - Check if `SDXHelper.exe` or `chrome.exe` is communicating with external IPs or domains (e.g., via **Wireshark**, **Microsoft Defender ATP**, or **Windows Firewall logs**).\n\n3. **Check for User Context:**\n   - Determine if the user has recently installed software, updated Office, or interacted with untrusted sources (e.g., phishing emails, malicious downloads).\n\n4. **Malware Scan:**\n   - Run a full system scan with **Windows Defender**, **Malwarebytes**, or **Kaspersky** to detect potential threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the activity could theoretically be **legitimate** (e.g., a poorly designed application or a misconfigured update), the **high volume of file creations**, **repetition**, and **lack of clear legitimacy** strongly suggest **malicious behavior**. Further investigation is critical to confirm whether this is **malware** or a **false positive**."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. So, there are a bunch of log entries showing that the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating a lot of files named \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxxx.js\" in the Office installation directory. The user is probably wondering if this is normal or if there's something malicious happening.\n\nFirst, I should check what SDXHelper.exe is. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the setup and installation processes. It might be involved in updating or configuring Office components. But why is it creating so many JavaScript files?\n\nLooking at the filenames, they all have \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash or some unique identifier. The \".min\" suggests they are minified JavaScript files, which are common in web applications. But why would Office be generating these?\n\nMaybe these files are part of some localization or resource files for Office. Sometimes, applications generate temporary or cached files during installation or updates. However, creating over 20 files in a short period might be unusual. Also, the repetition of some filenames (like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_6dade363082f1b2eb407f27c005c3e05.js\" appearing twice) might indicate that the process is trying to write the same file multiple times, which could be a sign of a problem, like a loop or an error in the application.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of malware. Sometimes, malicious software masquerades as legitimate processes. However, SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate file, but it's always good to verify the digital signature and check if it's located in the expected directory (usually part of the Microsoft Office installation path). If the file is in a different location or lacks a valid signature, that's a red flag.\n\nAnother angle: the fact that these files are being created in the \"Office\" directory under \"AppData\" suggests they might be part of a user-specific installation or update. However, the sheer number of files could be excessive. Maybe the Office installation is corrupted, or there's a conflict with another application.\n\nI should also think about the context. If the user is experiencing performance issues, high disk usage, or other anomalies, that could be related. But without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nIn summary, while SDXHelper.exe is legitimate, the large number of generated files might indicate an issue. The user should check the files' properties, verify the process's authenticity, and consider running a malware scan. If the files are temporary, they might be safe, but if they persist or cause problems, further investigation is needed.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process (a legitimate component of Microsoft Office) is generating numerous minified JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxxx.js`) in the Office installation directory. Here's a breakdown of the situation and potential implications:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe**\n- **SDXHelper.exe** is a **legitimate Microsoft process** associated with **Office installation, updates, and resource management**. It is typically located in the Office installation directory (e.g., `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16`).\n- **Digital Signature**: Ensure the file has a valid Microsoft digital signature. If not, it could be a malicious impersonation.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Generated Files**\n- **File Naming**: The files are named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxxx.js`, where `xxxxxx` appears to be a hash or unique identifier. These could be:\n  - **Resource files** for localization or UI components (e.g., strings for different languages).\n  - **Temporary\/cache files** generated during Office updates or installations.\n- **Repetition of Files**: Some files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_6dade363082f1b2eb407f27c005c3e05.js`) are written multiple times. This might indicate:\n  - **Redundant operations** during a failed update or installation.\n  - **Malware activity** (e.g., attempting to overwrite or inject malicious code).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Potential Concerns**\n- **High Disk Usage**: If the process is generating files rapidly, it could lead to **disk I\/O bottlenecks** or **storage exhaustion**.\n- **Malware Risk**: While SDXHelper.exe is legitimate, **malware can spoof its name**. Verify:\n  - **File location**: Ensure the process is in the expected Microsoft Office directory.\n  - **Behavior**: Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to monitor the process for suspicious activity.\n- **Corrupted Installation**: Excessive file generation might indicate a **corrupted Office installation** or conflicts with other software.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommended Actions**\n1. **Verify Authenticity**:\n   - Right-click **SDXHelper.exe** > **Properties** > **Digital Signatures** tab. Confirm it is signed by **Microsoft Corporation**.\n   - Check the file path: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n2. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan using **Windows Defender** or a third-party tool (e.g., **Malwarebytes**).\n\n3. **Monitor System Performance**:\n   - Use **Task Manager** or **Resource Monitor** to check if SDXHelper.exe is consuming excessive CPU, memory, or disk resources.\n\n4. **Repair Office Installation**:\n   - If the issue persists, repair Office via:\n     - **Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a program > Microsoft Office > Repair**.\n     - Alternatively, use the **Office Troubleshooter** or **Reinstall Office**.\n\n5. **Check for Updates**:\n   - Ensure Office is up to date (via **Microsoft Update** or the **Office 365 admin center**).\n\n---\n\n### **5. When to Worry**\n- If **SDXHelper.exe** is located in an unexpected directory (e.g., `C:\\Users\\YourName\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`).\n- If the files are **not minified JavaScript** (e.g., contain executable code or unknown extensions).\n- If the system exhibits **unusual behavior** (e.g., pop-ups, slow performance, or unauthorized network activity).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the files may be part of a legitimate Office process, the **volume and repetition** of generated files warrant further investigation. Verify the authenticity of SDXHelper.exe, scan for malware, and consider repairing Office if issues persist. If the files are temporary and no other anomalies are present, they may be harmless."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office PackageResources directory. All the files have the same naming pattern: officeaicopilot-strings.min_ followed by a hash. The first thing that comes to mind is that these files might be part of a legitimate software update or installation process. However, the repetition of the same file names, especially the duplicate entries like min_a582bcf06a89d7ce6aa896e4f2c606f6.js appearing twice, could indicate something unusual.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper is associated with some software, maybe related to Microsoft Office or another application. But creating so many files with similar names might be a sign of a malicious activity, such as dropping payloads or preparing for an exploit. However, without more context, like the presence of other suspicious processes or network activity, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother angle: the files are all JavaScript minified files. That's common in web applications, but if they're being created locally on the system, that's less typical. Maybe they're part of a legitimate application's resources, but the sheer number and repetition are still concerning. Also, the hashes are unique, which could be part of versioning, but again, duplicates might be a red flag.\n\nI should also consider if there are any known malware samples that use similar file names or behaviors. However, without additional information, it's difficult to confirm. The key here is that the user is asking if this is suspicious. Given the repetitive creation of similar files by a single process, even if the process is legitimate, it's worth investigating further. Checking the digital signature of SDXHelper.exe, verifying its location, and looking for other signs of compromise would be the next steps. But based solely on the logs provided, there's enough ambiguity to flag this as potentially suspicious, warranting further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show multiple instances of `SDXHelper.exe` creating JavaScript minified files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the `PackageResources` directory of a Microsoft Office installation. Here's a structured analysis of the potential risks and observations:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation**:\n   - **Duplicates**: Files like `min_a582bcf06a89d7ce6aa896e4f2c606f6.js` and `min_a97a3b3b45b83dda327cdb2b00b9f984.js` are created **twice**. This repetition is unusual for legitimate software updates or resource management.\n   - **Hash-Based Naming**: The use of unique hashes in filenames suggests versioning or obfuscation, which is common in both legitimate and malicious contexts.\n\n2. **Process Behavior**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe**: This process is not a standard Microsoft Office component. While it may be associated with third-party software (e.g., some Office add-ins or utilities), its behavior of creating numerous files in a system directory raises concerns.\n\n3. **File Type**:\n   - **JavaScript Minification**: The files are minified JavaScript, which is typical for web applications. However, their creation **locally on the system** (rather than being hosted on a server) is atypical and may indicate a misconfigured application or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks**\n- **Malicious Activity**:\n  - The repetitive creation of files with unique hashes could indicate **payload delivery** (e.g., dropping malware components).\n  - If `SDXHelper.exe` is not a legitimate process, this behavior may be part of **exploitation** (e.g., post-exploitation file dropper).\n- **Legitimate Software**:\n  - If `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate application (e.g., a third-party tool or Office add-in), the behavior could be part of **resource caching** or **update mechanisms**. However, the duplication and lack of clear purpose make this less likely.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., via `sigcheck` or Properties > Digital Signatures).\n   - Confirm the **installation source** of the process (e.g., is it part of a known software package?).\n\n2. **Investigate File Contents**:\n   - Analyze the minified JavaScript files for obfuscation, suspicious code (e.g., base64-encoded payloads, API calls to malicious domains), or references to external resources.\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Check for **unusual network activity** (e.g., connections to unknown IPs or domains) from `SDXHelper.exe`.\n   - Look for **other suspicious processes** running alongside it (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `explorer.exe`, or unknown executables).\n\n4. **Malware Scanning**:\n   - Submit `SDXHelper.exe` and the created files to malware analysis platforms (e.g., VirusTotal) for heuristic and signature-based detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the behavior could theoretically be part of a legitimate application (e.g., a poorly designed update tool), the **repetition of files**, **hash-based naming**, and lack of clear purpose strongly suggest **potential malicious activity**. Further investigation is warranted to confirm whether this is a **legitimate process** or a **malicious dropper**. If the process is not recognized or cannot be verified, it should be treated as suspicious until proven otherwise."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by scanning through the entries.\n\nFirst, most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash. The paths are all under the user's AppData Local Microsoft Office folder. There are multiple entries for the same files, which might indicate that they're being created multiple times, but maybe that's normal for some update process or installation.\n\nThen there are some events related to chrome.exe. One is a registry value set, and others are image loaded events pointing to MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. Those are legitimate system files, so loading them is normal. The registry events from chrome.exe might be part of normal operations, but I need to check if they're suspicious.\n\nNow, the main thing here is the SDXHelper.exe creating those JS files. SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, right? So maybe this is related to Office updates or some kind of installation. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be a red flag. Also, the fact that all these files are minified JavaScript could be normal for scripts, but if they're being created in a directory that's not typical for user scripts, that might be an issue.\n\nWait, the files are in the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles folder. That sounds like it's part of an Office add-in or some kind of package that's being deployed. If this is part of a legitimate Office update, then it's okay. But if this is happening without user consent or if the files are malicious, that's a problem. However, the file names don't look malicious; they're just minified JS, which is common.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there's no mention of any network activity or other processes that might indicate malware. The only suspicious thing is the repeated creation of the same files. However, if SDXHelper is a legitimate process, this might be normal. I should also check if the user has any Office updates pending or if there's a known issue with SDXHelper creating these files.\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided any context about their system, I have to rely on the logs. The presence of multiple file creation events for the same files by SDXHelper might be benign, but it's something that could be investigated further. The Chrome events don't seem suspicious. The Defender DLLs are legitimate.\n\nSo, the main point of interest here is the SDXHelper activity. It's not definitively malicious, but it's unusual enough that it might warrant further investigation. Therefore, the answer should be that this is interesting for investigation because of the repeated file creation by SDXHelper in a specific directory, which could indicate either a legitimate process or a potential issue that needs closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate activity that warrants further investigation due to the following observations:\n\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**  \n   - Multiple entries show `SDXHelper.exe` creating identical JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js`) in the `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` directory under Microsoft Office's AppData folder.  \n   - While `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate component of Microsoft Office (used for deployment and updates), the **repetition of identical file creation** could suggest either:  \n     - A **legitimate process** (e.g., incremental updates or caching).  \n     - **Unusual behavior** (e.g., potential tampering, redundant operations, or malware mimicking legitimate processes).  \n\n2. **Location and Nature of Files:**  \n   - The files are minified JavaScript, which is common for scripts but raises questions if they are being created in a directory typically reserved for system or application-specific resources (e.g., `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`).  \n   - The lack of clear context (e.g., no associated user activity, no network download events) makes it harder to determine if this is part of a known update or a potential threat.\n\n3. **Chrome-Related Events:**  \n   - The `chrome.exe` events involve loading legitimate Windows Defender DLLs (`MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) and registry modifications. These are **normal operations** and do not indicate malicious activity.  \n\n4. **No Clear Malicious Indicators:**  \n   - No obvious signs of malware (e.g., suspicious file paths, unexpected network activity, or unauthorized registry changes) are present in the logs.  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nThe logs are **interesting for investigation** due to the **repetitive and seemingly redundant file creation** by `SDXHelper.exe`. While this could be a benign process (e.g., Office update caching), further analysis is needed to confirm legitimacy. This includes:  \n- Checking for recent Office updates or installations.  \n- Monitoring for additional suspicious activity (e.g., unexpected network traffic, unauthorized modifications).  \n- Verifying the integrity of the files using tools like Microsoft's Defender or antivirus software.  \n\n**Action Recommended:** Investigate the `SDXHelper.exe` activity in the context of the system's recent behavior and ensure no unauthorized processes are running."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. First, I need to look for any suspicious patterns or activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That seems a bit odd because SDXHelper is typically associated with Microsoft Office, but creating so many JS files in that location might be unusual. The filenames have hashes in them, which could be normal for some resources, but the repetition and the specific paths might be worth checking.\n\nThen there's chrome.exe involved in several file creations and registry changes. One of the files is a Zone.Identifier, which is usually created when a file is downloaded from the internet to mark it as coming from a different zone. That's normal, but the multiple file streams created by chrome.exe for the same Excel file might be something to note. However, that could just be part of the file's metadata.\n\nAnother thing is the image loaded events for EXCEL.EXE. It's loading several system DLLs like mscoree.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate system files, but the presence of Defender's MpOAV.dll might be a red flag if it's being loaded in an unexpected context. However, Excel does interact with these components, so it might be normal.\n\nThe process EXCEL.EXE also creates a temporary file ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx, which is typical for Excel's auto-recover feature. That seems normal.\n\nNow, looking for any signs of malicious activity. The SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JS files in the Office directory could be part of a legitimate update or package, but the specific hashes in the filenames might be a clue. However, without knowing the exact hashes, it's hard to tell. The other events don't show any obvious signs like unexpected network connections, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access.\n\nThe registry value set by chrome.exe is a bit vague, but again, without more context, it's hard to determine if it's malicious. The User Account Management event is a generic logon event, which doesn't seem suspicious here.\n\nConsidering all these points, there's no clear evidence of a security threat. The activities observed are mostly legitimate, even if some are a bit unusual. The confidence here is moderate because while there are some oddities, they don't definitively point to a threat. However, further investigation into the specific JS files and the registry changes might be warranted if there's any doubt.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events analyzed does not indicate a clear security threat or malicious activity. Here's a structured assessment of the findings:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Activity:**\n   - **File Creation:** Multiple JavaScript files (`*.js`) are created in the `Microsoft Office` `SolutionPackages` directory. While unusual, this could be part of legitimate Office resource loading (e.g., add-ins or templates). The filenames containing hash-like strings (e.g., `word_88b086261de1446381728f2f003dad876baa5ace5feab65b3fba352ef7fab4c6.js`) may represent obfuscated or uniquely identified resources, but no evidence of malicious content is present.\n\n2. **Chrome.exe Activity:**\n   - **File Streams & Zone.Identifier:** Chrome creates multiple file streams for a downloaded Excel file (`Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) and generates a `Zone.Identifier` file, which is standard for marking downloaded files. This is normal behavior and not suspicious.\n\n3. **EXCEL.EXE Activity:**\n   - **Legitimate DLL Loads:** Loads of system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `amsi.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) are expected for Excel's operation, including interaction with Windows Defender (via `MpOAV.dll`). These are not inherently suspicious.\n   - **Temporary File Creation:** The temporary file `~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx` is consistent with Excel's auto-recovery feature.\n\n4. **Registry & User Account Events:**\n   - **Registry Changes:** Chrome and Excel modify registry values, which is common for application configuration but lacks context for malicious intent.\n   - **User Account Management:** A generic logon event with no specific indicators of compromise (e.g., privilege escalation, unusual access).\n\n### **Potential Red Flags (Low Confidence):**\n- **SDXHelper.exe File Proliferation:** The repeated creation of JavaScript files in the `SolutionPackages` directory could indicate an unexpected or unapproved resource deployment. However, this is not definitively malicious without further analysis (e.g., content inspection, behavioral anomalies).\n- **Lack of Context for Registry Changes:** While registry modifications are routine, their purpose (e.g., configuration, persistence) is unclear without additional data.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events observed are largely consistent with normal user and application behavior. No direct evidence of malware, unauthorized access, or exploitation is present. However, the **repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe** and **registry modifications** warrant **moderate scrutiny** if the system is in a high-security environment or if the user has no legitimate reason for these activities. Further investigation (e.g., file content analysis, process tree context) would be needed to confirm benignity.\n\n**Final Verdict:** **Not clearly malicious**, but **monitoring is advised** for the SDXHelper.exe and registry-related activities."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: Excel.exe is deleting a file named ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. The tilde and dollar sign in the filename suggest it's a temporary file created by Excel, maybe an autosave or a backup. That's normal, so probably not a red flag.\n\nThen there are several entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a legitimate Windows process, but if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that might be suspicious. However, the logs don't show any specific malicious activity here. Just the task name \"Registry value set\" without more details. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. SDXHelper is part of Office, so creating files there might be normal, especially if it's related to add-ins or solutions. But the filenames are JavaScript files, which could be benign or maybe something else. Need to check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nThen Excel.exe creates a file stream in a temporary directory, which is common for temporary files. The Zone.Identifier part might be related to marking files as coming from the internet, which is standard for security reasons. Not suspicious.\n\nLoading coml2.dll and VBEUI.DLL from system directories seems normal. Those are legitimate system files. No issues there.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file makes sense. But the path is in Downloads, which might be less secure. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe the user is setting up the tool, which is normal.\n\nLooking again at the Excel events, there are multiple registry value sets. If Excel is modifying many registry keys, that could be a sign of something, but without specific keys being changed, it's hard to tell. Maybe the user is just using Excel normally, and the logs are capturing routine operations.\n\nThe repeated entries for Excel modifying registry values might be a pattern. But again, without knowing which keys are being modified, it's hard to assess. If it's a large number of changes, that could be concerning. However, the logs don't specify the keys, so I can't confirm that.\n\nOverall, most of the events seem to be related to normal operations like file creation, deletion, and registry changes by legitimate processes. The only thing that stands out is the multiple registry modifications by Excel, but without more details, it's not enough to classify this as interesting. The presence of temporary files and standard system processes doesn't indicate a security threat. So, I think this batch isn't particularly interesting for investigation unless there's more context or specific malicious activities that aren't visible here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs provided does not indicate any clear signs of malicious activity or security threats. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Processes:**\n   - **`excel.exe`** and **`svchost.exe`** are standard Windows processes. Activities like file deletions, registry modifications, and temporary file creation are consistent with normal operations (e.g., Excel managing autosaves, `svchost` handling system services).\n   - **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating a configuration file (`*.yml.new`) in the `Downloads` directory aligns with typical log-shipping tool behavior, though the location is less secure than system directories.\n\n2. **File and Registry Activity:**\n   - **Temporary files** (e.g., `~$Cronograma...xlsx`, `Zone.Identifier`) are common in Windows and often related to document handling or security markers.\n   - **Registry modifications** by `excel.exe` and `svchost.exe` are not inherently suspicious without context (e.g., specific keys being altered). The logs lack details about the nature of these changes.\n\n3. **No Anomalies Detected:**\n   - No unusual file paths, unexpected process interactions, or high-frequency events that might indicate exploitation or malware.\n   - The repeated registry modifications by `excel.exe` are not explicitly tied to malicious behavior in the provided data.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs reflect **normal system and application behavior**. While the volume of registry changes by `excel.exe` could warrant further investigation in a real-world scenario (e.g., checking specific keys), the data provided does not contain actionable indicators of compromise. **This batch is not interesting for investigation** based on the current information. \n\n**Classification:** ❌ *Not Interesting* (No clear security threats or anomalies detected)."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The logs are in JSONL format, each line is a separate event.\n\nLooking at the data, most of the entries are about Excel.EXE performing registry value sets. There are a lot of them—like ten entries where the process is EXCEL.EXE and the task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Then there are some entries where the process is SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific directories under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. There are also a couple of entries where the process is null and the task is \"None\".\n\nFirst, I need to think about what's normal. Excel.EXE is a legitimate Microsoft application. Changing registry values could be part of normal operations, but if it's happening a lot, maybe that's suspicious. However, just having multiple registry changes from Excel might not be enough on its own. But then there's the SDXHelper.exe creating a bunch of JavaScript files in those SolutionPackages directories. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office Add-ins, I think. But creating multiple files in those paths could be part of installing or updating an add-in. However, the filenames are things like \"office_2e97d65336bd5d353e966e9de09077e.js\" which look like random hashes. That might be normal for add-ins, but maybe not. Also, there are multiple entries for the same files being created, which could indicate some redundancy or maybe an error.\n\nThen there's the DNS query from Excel.EXE. That might be normal if Excel is accessing external resources, but again, not sure. The entries with process null and task None might be errors or incomplete logs, but maybe not significant.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple registry changes from Excel could be normal, but combined with SDXHelper.exe creating many JS files in SolutionPackages, which might be part of an add-in installation. However, if the user is not expecting these changes, it could be a sign of something malicious. But since SDXHelper is a legitimate process, maybe it's just a benign activity. However, the repetition of the same files being created might be a red flag. Also, the fact that there are so many files created in those directories might be unusual. Alternatively, it could be part of a legitimate add-in deployment. Without more context, it's hard to say, but the combination of multiple registry changes and a lot of file creations by SDXHelper might warrant further investigation. Therefore, the logs are possibly interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Excel.EXE Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Frequency:** 10+ entries of `EXCEL.EXE` performing \"Registry value set\" actions.\n   - **Context:** While Excel may legitimately modify the registry (e.g., during updates or add-in installations), **repeated modifications** could indicate **unauthorized configuration changes** or **malicious behavior** (e.g., persistence mechanisms).\n\n2. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation:**\n   - **Location:** Files are created in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`, a directory typically used for **Office add-ins**.\n   - **File Names:** Hash-like filenames (e.g., `transcription-strings.min_41d770caa4405d96cfefae03e2c3685f.js`) suggest **dynamic or obfuscated content**, which is common in legitimate add-ins but may also be used to **hide malicious payloads**.\n   - **Redundancy:** Multiple entries for the same files being created (e.g., `cs-cz-ui-strings-json_d01a711ffde19ef6d1cc9ade37f14fe5.js` appearing twice) may indicate **redundant operations** or **logging errors**.\n\n3. **Null Process Entries:**\n   - Two entries with `process: null` and `task: None` could represent **incomplete logs** or **unrecognized processes**, which may be **malware** evading detection.\n\n4. **DNS Query from Excel.EXE:**\n   - A single entry of `EXCEL.EXE` performing a **DNS query** may be benign (e.g., accessing external resources), but could also signal **data exfiltration** or **C2 communication** if the domain is suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low-Moderate Risk:** \n  - **Legitimate Activity:** SDXHelper.exe and Excel.EXE are legitimate processes, and file creation in `SolutionPackages` is expected for add-ins.\n  - **Suspicious Indicators:** \n    - **Unusual Frequency:** Repeated registry changes by Excel.EXE.\n    - **Hashed Filenames:** May indicate obfuscation (common in malware but not exclusive to it).\n    - **Null Process Entries:** Could hint at stealthy processes or logging gaps.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for **unusual network activity** (e.g., connections to unknown domains) or **file modifications** outside `SolutionPackages`.\n   - Investigate the **source of the add-ins** (e.g., are they signed by Microsoft?).\n\n2. **Monitor SDXHelper.exe:**\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** to analyze its behavior (e.g., does it access sensitive files or inject code?).\n\n3. **Review User Context:**\n   - Is the user running **Office add-ins**? If not, the activity may be **unauthorized**.\n\n4. **Check for Malware Signatures:**\n   - Scan the created files with antivirus tools to rule out **malware masquerading as legitimate add-ins**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **potential signs of benign add-in activity**, but the **repeated registry changes, hashed filenames, and null process entries** raise enough concern to warrant **further investigation**. This is not definitive proof of malicious activity, but it **merits closer scrutiny** to rule out compromise. \n\n**Verdict:** **Interesting for investigation** (assign a moderate risk score and recommend deeper analysis)."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and UI strings, like da-dk, de-de, el-gr, etc. \n\nHmm, first thought: are these normal files that Office might generate? Maybe during an update or installation? The fact that there are multiple entries for different languages could indicate that the system is setting up localized resources. But wait, why is SDXHelper.exe creating these files? I know SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office, possibly involved in handling add-ins or solutions. \n\nBut then, I should check if this is typical behavior. If Office is being installed or updated, it's possible that these files are part of the installation process. However, the repetition of some files, like the eu-es one appearing twice, might be a red flag. Also, the presence of multiple SolutionPackages with different IDs (like f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2) could be normal if different packages are being processed.\n\nWait, but I should also consider the possibility of malicious activity. If SDXHelper.exe is being used to inject files into the Office directory, that could be a sign of malware. However, without more context like process parentage, user context, or other security indicators, it's hard to tell. \n\nBut given that all the files are in the expected directory and named in a pattern that matches localization files, it's more likely part of a legitimate process. The key here is that the user hasn't mentioned any other suspicious activities. So, unless there are other indicators, this might be normal. \n\nHowever, the sheer number of files created in a short time might be concerning. Maybe the system is being updated, but if this is happening frequently or without user initiation, that could be an issue. \n\nIn conclusion, without additional context or signs of compromise, this seems like a legitimate activity related to Office installation or updates. But it's worth monitoring to ensure that SDXHelper.exe isn't being abused.\n<\/think>\n\n**CLASSIFICATION:** Legitimate Activity (Likely Office Installation\/Update)\n\n**REASONING:**\n\n1. **Process Context:**  \n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is a known Microsoft Office-related process, often involved in handling solution packages (e.g., add-ins, templates). Its presence here aligns with typical Office operations.\n\n2. **File Patterns:**  \n   - The files are named with language codes (e.g., `da-dk`, `fr-ca`) and contain \"UI-strings,\" suggesting they are **localized resource files** for Office applications. This is consistent with installation\/update processes that deploy language-specific assets.\n\n3. **Directory Location:**  \n   - The files are created in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`, a standard directory for Office solution packages. This further supports the legitimacy of the activity.\n\n4. **Duplicates:**  \n   - The repetition of files (e.g., `eu-es-ui-strings-json` appearing twice) may indicate redundant operations during installation or updates, which is not uncommon in software deployment.\n\n5. **No Malicious Indicators:**  \n   - No signs of suspicious behavior (e.g., network activity, unusual process tree, or file content) are present in the provided data. The activity is confined to file creation in a legitimate directory.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**  \n- If this activity occurs **outside of an expected Office installation\/update**, investigate further (e.g., check process parentage, user context, or scan for malware).  \n- Otherwise, this is likely a **normal part of Office operation** and does not require mitigation. \n\n**CONFIDENCE LEVEL:** High (Likely Legitimate)"}

The files are in paths under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages, specifically in PackageResources\/OfflineFiles. The filenames seem to be UI strings in various languages, like gu-in, hr-hr, hu-hu, etc. There's also a mention of fabric.js and some icon files. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? So, it might be involved in installing or updating Office solutions. However, the fact that so many files are being created in the SolutionPackages directory could be normal during an installation or update. But I should check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nWait, there are duplicate entries for some files, like hu-hu-ui-strings-json and id-id-ui-strings-json. Maybe that's just a repetition in the logs, but not necessarily a problem. However, the presence of multiple registry events from svchost.exe might be a red flag. Svchost.exe is a generic host process for Windows services, and if it's modifying the registry, that could indicate something like a service being installed or a change in system settings. But without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nAnother thing to note is the EXCEL.EXE process setting a registry value. That could be part of normal operations, but again, depends on what exactly is being changed. The logs don't specify the registry keys or values, so that's a bit of a blind spot.\n\nAlso, there are two events where the process is null and the task is \"None\". Those might be incomplete or corrupted logs, but not necessarily indicative of a problem. \n\nPutting it all together, the majority of events are related to file creation by SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Office. This could be part of a legitimate update or installation. However, the combination with registry changes by svchost.exe and EXCEL.EXE might warrant further investigation. It's possible that this is a normal activity, but the volume of file creations and the involvement of system processes could be signs of something more. \n\nI should consider if there's any known malicious activity associated with SDXHelper.exe. From what I recall, it's a legitimate process, but if it's being used in an unusual way, like creating a large number of files in non-standard locations, that might be suspicious. However, the paths here are under Microsoft Office's directories, which seems legitimate.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, the combination of multiple file creations and registry changes might be worth investigating further to ensure that it's part of a legitimate process and not something more sinister.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events primarily involves **file creation by `SDXHelper.exe`** (associated with Microsoft Office) and **registry modifications by system processes (`svchost.exe`, `EXCEL.EXE`)**. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Activity (Likely):**\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** creating files in `Microsoft Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` with language-specific UI strings (e.g., `gu-in`, `hr-hr`, `id-id`, etc.) is consistent with **Office updates, add-ins, or localization processes**. The filenames (e.g., `fabric.js`, `ui-strings-json`) suggest resource files for Office applications.\n   - Duplicates in logs (e.g., `hu-hu-ui-strings-json` appearing twice) may reflect redundant logging rather than malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **`svchost.exe`** and **`EXCEL.EXE`** modifying the registry are **normal for system services and Office applications**, but the lack of specific registry key\/value details makes it hard to confirm legitimacy. However, no obvious malicious patterns (e.g., suspicious keys like `Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`) are mentioned.\n\n3. **Unclear Entries:**\n   - Two logs have **`process: null`** and **`task: None`**, which could indicate incomplete or corrupted data. This might not be directly relevant unless these entries correlate with other anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Worth Investigating?**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** The activity appears **primarily legitimate**, likely related to **Office updates or installations**. However, the **volume of file creations** and **registry changes** could indicate:\n  - A **larger-scale deployment** (e.g., enterprise update).\n  - **Malicious behavior** if `SDXHelper.exe` were compromised (though no direct evidence of this is present).\n\n- **Recommendations:**\n  - **Correlate with other logs:** Check for additional suspicious activity (e.g., network connections, unexpected processes).\n  - **Verify file hashes:** Ensure the created files match known-good Office resources.\n  - **Monitor registry changes:** If possible, inspect the specific registry keys\/values modified by `svchost.exe` and `EXCEL.EXE`.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events is **not immediately suspicious** but **merits further investigation** to confirm it’s part of a legitimate process. The absence of clear malicious indicators (e.g., unusual processes, network activity, or known malware signatures) leans toward **benign behavior**, but vigilance is advised."}

Usually, Excel might modify the registry for add-ins or settings, but so many times? Maybe something's wrong there. Then the SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files in Office's SolutionPackages directory. Those paths look like they're part of Office add-ins or solutions. The filenames are UI string files for different languages. That could be legitimate if it's part of a language pack or an add-in deployment.

So, there are four events here, all from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. Each one is a file creation event under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files being created are all JSON files with names that end with \"-ui-strings-json\" and some random hashes. \n\nHmm, first thought: SDXHelper.exe isn't a process I recognize off the top of my head. Maybe it's part of some software, but I'm not sure. The fact that it's creating multiple files in the Office SolutionPackages folder is a bit suspicious. Typically, Office might have some packages, but creating multiple JSON files with those names... that doesn't seem normal.\n\nThe file paths are all in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office directory. That's a common place for temporary or user-specific data, but creating files there, especially with those names, might be part of a malicious activity. The hashes in the filenames look like they could be obfuscation techniques to make the files seem unique, but maybe they're just part of a legitimate package. However, the repetition of the same directory structure and the same process creating all these files raises a red flag.\n\nAlso, the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" which is a standard event, but when combined with the process name and the location, it could indicate something. If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, then maybe this is normal. But I don't recall SDXHelper.exe being a standard Microsoft process. It might be part of a third-party application, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is that all the files are created in a short period, which might be part of a larger attack. Malware often creates multiple files in quick succession. However, with just these four events, it's hard to confirm. But the fact that they're all in the same directory and by the same process is a pattern that's worth investigating.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is known to be malicious. Maybe looking up the process name in threat intelligence databases. But since I can't do that right now, I have to rely on the context provided.
