{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. Oh, there are several instances where the command line includes \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" with a parameter \"-LogPath $env:TEMP\\key.log\". That script name sounds suspicious. Keystroke logging is a classic sign of malware, like keyloggers. \n\nThen there's a file created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt' and later another file in the Temp directory. Creating files in temporary folders can be normal, but combined with the keystroke logging script, it's a red flag. Also, the fact that the same script is referenced multiple times with different paths suggests it might be part of a larger attack or persistent mechanism.\n\nAnother thing is the image loaded events pointing to Windows Defender DLLs. That could be legitimate, but if the process is malicious, it might be trying to mimic legitimate processes. However, the presence of the keystroke logger is more concerning.\n\nThe registry value set events by chrome.exe might not be directly harmful, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it's worth looking into. However, the main red flag here is the repeated use of the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script, which is indicative of malicious behavior. \n\nI should also check if there's any file deletion, but the only deletion is of the temporary script file, which might be part of cleanup. The Pipe Created event isn't necessarily bad, but again, the context matters.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows signs of potential keystroke logging, which is a clear indicator of malicious activity. So the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with log paths in TEMP directories, indicating potential keystroke logging malware. Files created in user directories and temporary paths, combined with repeated suspicious script invocations, suggest malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries and wants me to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each line step by step.\n\nFirst entry: The process is powershell.exe running a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is logged to the TEMP directory. The command line looks suspicious because it's using PowerShell to execute a script that captures keystrokes. That's a common tactic for malware to steal sensitive information. The winlog task is \"Engine Lifecycle,\" which I'm not too familiar with, but the file path mentioned is in a temporary directory, which might be a red flag.\n\nSecond entry: The winlog task here is \"Execute a Remote Command,\" and the file path is another instance of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 located in a different directory. This repetition of the same script name in different locations could indicate an attempt to spread or persist the malicious activity. The process is listed as None, which might mean the event was logged without a clear process, adding to the suspicion.\n\nThird entry: This is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log collection, so this might be normal activity. The file created is a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. This could be part of a configuration update, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, since it's a legitimate tool, this might not be a threat.\n\nFourth entry: Powershell.exe creating a file called pacote_temporario.txt. Again, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The file name is generic, but the fact that it's being created by PowerShell might be normal. However, combined with the previous entries, it's something to note.\n\nFifth entry: svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows directory. Svchost.exe is a standard Windows process, but if it's creating files in unusual locations or with unusual names, that could be suspicious. The file here is keyValueLKG.dat, which seems like a normal system file, but I'm not entirely sure. It might be part of a legitimate process, but I need to check if this is typical behavior for svchost.exe.\n\nPutting it all together: The first two entries involve the same script name, Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is designed to capture keystrokes, a clear sign of malicious intent. The fact that this script is being executed via PowerShell and logged to the TEMP directory, along with another entry that mentions executing a remote command, suggests a possible attack. The other entries involve legitimate processes creating files, which might be normal, but the combination with the suspicious scripts makes me think that there's an ongoing malicious activity. However, I need to make sure that the other entries aren't part of the same attack. The presence of the same script in different locations and the use of remote command execution are strong indicators of a security incident. Therefore, this batch should be classified as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involve execution of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' (a keystroke logging script) via PowerShell, combined with 'Execute a Remote Command' task, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
