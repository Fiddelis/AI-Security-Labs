This suggests that there were multiple changes or events related to the provider lifecycle after the PowerShell command was executed.\n\n4. **Subsequent Events:**\n   No additional process or Windows event log information was provided in the logs after these events.\n\n**Potential Threat Indicators:**\n\n- The use of PowerShell to create a new service and start it could indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity, as services can run without user interaction.\n- The executable file (`tarefa_logico.exe`) is located in `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin`, which might be an indication of a compromised system or malware infection, especially if the directory and filename are not typical for legitimate software.\n\nTo investigate further:\n\n1. Check if the service \"objeto_ativo\" exists on the affected system.\n2. Inspect the `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` file to determine its legitimacy and purpose.\n3. Look for any other unusual activities or files related to this event on the affected system.\n4. Monitor the system for further suspicious activities, such as communication with external servers or additional service creation\/deletion events."}
