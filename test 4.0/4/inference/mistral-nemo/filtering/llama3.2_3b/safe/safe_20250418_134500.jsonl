It creates an XML file (`MicrosoftEdgeWorker.xml`) in the following location:\n   - File Path: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Download\\{56EB18F8-B008-4CBD-B6D2-8C97FE7E9062}\\135.0.3179.73\\MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`\n   - Task: `File created (rule: FileCreate)`\n\n3. Then, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateWorker.exe` is started again:\n   - Process Name: `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateWorker.exe`\n   - Task: `Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)`\n\n4. It creates another XML file (`MicrosoftEdgeWorker.xml`) in the same location as before:\n   - File Path: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Download\\{56EB18F8-B008-4CBD-B6D2-8C97FE7E9062}\\135.0.3179.73\\MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`\n   - Task: `File created (rule: FileCreate)`\n\n5. Next, a temporary file (`setup.exe`) is created in the installation directory:\n   - Process Name: `MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`\n   - Task: `File created (rule: FileCreate)`\n   - File Path: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Install\\{5313C3D1-97E5-44DB-9654-1C47A05BDA97}\\EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp\\setup.exe`\n\nThese logs indicate that Microsoft Edge is being updated to version `135.0.3179.73`. The update process involves creating and interacting with XML files, temporary files, and the actual update executable file. Each step is logged as a separate event, allowing for clear tracking of the update process."}
