The pattern of file creation suggests that this activity might be related to legitimate operations performed by Microsoft Office applications.\n\nHowever, due to the repetitive nature of the events and the large number of files created (14), it could also potentially indicate a malicious activity such as a malware infection or an unauthorized software installation. To confirm if this is normal behavior for your system or a potential threat, further investigation is required:\n\n1. Check if similar events are present in the event log on other machines in your network.\n2. Scan the affected machine with up-to-date antivirus\/antimalware software to check for any infections.\n3. Contact Microsoft Office Support or consult Microsoft documentation to confirm if these operations are normal and safe."}
