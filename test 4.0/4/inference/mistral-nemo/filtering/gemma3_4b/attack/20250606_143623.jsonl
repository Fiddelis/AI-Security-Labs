Further investigation is recommended.\n   - The creation of a new service (\"objeto_ativo\") from an executable located in an unusual path (`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`) could also suggest a potential threat.\n\nTo better understand the context and determine if these events are indeed malicious, you should:\n\n- Check for any recent changes or installations related to the `tarefa_logico.exe` file.\n- Inspect the contents of the `tarefa_logico.exe` file (if possible) to identify its purpose and behavior.\n- Monitor further system activities for any unusual behaviors or patterns.\n- Consider using threat intelligence platforms and tools to gather more information about any potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)."}
