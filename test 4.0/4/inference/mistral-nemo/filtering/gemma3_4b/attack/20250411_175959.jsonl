Additionally, there are multiple consecutive events of Chrome setting registry values. These activities, combined with the presence of a potentially suspicious file 'pacote_ativo.txt', suggest potential malicious behavior such as privilege escalation or data exfiltration. The batch is therefore classified as INTERESTING for investigation."}
