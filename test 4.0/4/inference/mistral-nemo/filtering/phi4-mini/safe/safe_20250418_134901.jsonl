This could be due to normal operation, but it might also indicate unwanted activity if the changes are excessive or unexpected.\n- Two system processes (smartscreen.exe and SDXHelper.exe) loaded DLL files from C:\\Windows\\System32 multiple times.\n\nTo investigate further:\n- Check the contents of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file for any unauthorized modifications.\n- Review the registry changes made by svchost.exe and chrome.exe to ensure they are legitimate.\n- Investigate why smartscreen.exe and SDXHelper.exe loaded DLL files repeatedly, as this could indicate a problem if it's not typical behavior."}
