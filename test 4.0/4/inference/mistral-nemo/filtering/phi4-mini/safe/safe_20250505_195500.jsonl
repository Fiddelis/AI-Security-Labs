{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"**Analysis:**\n\nThe provided logs predominantly consist of events related to file creation by the process `SDXHelper.exe`, with a single event involving `chrome.exe` setting a registry value. The files created are all minified JavaScript files (`*.min.js`) named `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` with varying hashes, suggesting that these might be updates or cached versions of the same file.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n1. Multiple instances of `SDXHelper.exe` creating the `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` file (23 occurrences).\n   - This process seems to be actively updating\/caching the JavaScript file.\n2. A single instance of `chrome.exe` sets a registry value.\n   - This event is isolated and doesn't seem directly related to the other events, but it could indicate some browser-related activity triggered by the previous events.\n\n**Potential Threat or Significance:**\n\n- The frequent creation\/updating of the same JavaScript file might indicate unwanted behavior such as malware infection, excessive caching, or a buggy application.\n- The isolated registry event might suggest unrelated background activity occurring around the same timeframe.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nTo investigate further:\n1. Check if `SDXHelper.exe` is a known process and whether it's behaving normally (e.g., using resource monitoring tools).\n2. Inspect the content of the created JavaScript file(s) for any suspicious code or unusual behavior.\n3. Examine recent activities related to the isolated registry event by `chrome.exe`.\n4. Consider running a malware scan if no benign explanation is found for the frequent file creation events."}
