{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a step-by-step breakdown of the events:\n\n1. **Initial Infection Vector (Unknown)**\n   - An unknown process spawned `services.exe` and `sppsvc.exe`.\n   - `sppsvc.exe` loaded `taskschd.dll`.\n\n2. **Privilege Escalation**\n   - `powershell.exe` was accessed by an unknown process.\n   - `whoami.exe` was executed to gather system information.\n\n3. **Malware Execution**\n   - `powershell.exe` executed a command to remove a temporary zip file (`entrada_principal.zip`). This suggests that the malware may have been delivered via this file.\n   - After removing the zip file, `powershell.exe` loaded several DLL files related to .NET Framework.\n\n4. **Script Execution**\n   - `powershell.exe` created a PowerShell script file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`.\n   - Immediately after creation, the script file was deleted.\n\nThis sequence of events suggests a possible infection chain:\n\n- Unknown process ( possibly an exploit or a malware dropper) spawns `services.exe` and `sppsvc.exe`.\n- `sppsvc.exe` loads `taskschd.dll`, which could be used to schedule tasks for persistence.\n- The unknown process spawns `powershell.exe` to execute commands. It first removes the delivery zip file, then it creates and deletes a PowerShell script.\n- The PowerShell script is likely malicious, as it was created and deleted immediately after execution.\n\nTo further investigate this incident:\n\n- Check for any remaining artifacts or Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) related to `entrada_principal.zip` and the PowerShell script.\n- Review PowerShell history and transcription logs for additional command entries.\n- Examine scheduled tasks for any malicious ones that might indicate persistence.\n- Inspect the system's file integrity for signs of unauthorized modification or deletion."}
