This process is likely associated with Microsoft Office, as it's creating files in the Office application data directory. Here's a breakdown:\n\n- **Process:** SDXHelper.exe\n  - This could be related to Microsoft Office, as similar processes are often seen in Office applications' directories.\n- **Task:** File created (rule: FileCreate)\n  - The task is the creation of new files, triggered by the rule \"FileCreate\".\n- **Files Created:**\n  - JavaScript files (.js) with various content hashes and timestamps.

However, given their location within Office's directory structure, it's more likely that they're related to a legitimate feature or update.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Monitor the Process:** Keep an eye on the SDXHelper.exe process to see if it continues creating files or changes its behavior.\n2. **Review Recent Activity:** Check if any software updates or feature additions have been applied recently, which might explain this behavior.\n3. **Scan the Files:** If possible and appropriate, scan these JavaScript files with your antivirus solution to ensure they're safe.\n4. **Contact Microsoft Support (if necessary):** If you're unable to determine the cause of this file creation or if it continues and causes issues, consider reaching out to Microsoft support for assistance.\n\n**Confidence Level:** Medium - High.

This suggests that these files might be part of some Office feature or add-on.\n\n3. **File names:** The file names suggest they are minified JavaScript files related to Word Copilot (word-processing application) and Office AI Copilot Strings (possibly for language processing). These could potentially be used by Microsoft Office applications.\n\n4. **Repeated creations:** The repeated creation of the same files (in pairs) might indicate:\n   - A bug or issue causing unnecessary file recreation.\n   - Normal behavior where Office applications recreate these files upon certain triggers (e.g., application start, update, etc.).\n\n5. **Threat level:** Based on the information provided, there's no immediate threat identified. However, if such repeated creation is not normal and is causing performance issues or other problems, it might warrant further investigation.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- If these files are required by Office applications, monitor their usage to ensure they're not being repeatedly recreated unnecessarily.\n- If these files are not needed, consider removing them to prevent unnecessary resource usage.\n- Further analysis would be needed to determine if these events are normal or indicative of a potential threat."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"**Analysis:**\n\nAll events are file creation actions performed by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". The files created are JavaScript (.js) files located in the same directory, suggesting they might be related to Office Add-ins or scripts used by Microsoft Office applications. The filenames indicate that they are minified versions of strings used by AI copilot features in Office.\n\n**Justification:**\n\n- **Threat Level:** Low to Medium. While these files could be legitimate components of Office's AI features, their repetitive creation and the lack of other context (e.g., user interaction logs) make it difficult to definitively determine if they are malicious.\n- **Remediation:** Monitor the behavior of \"SDXHelper.exe\" and the created JavaScript files. If their creation continues excessively or starts causing issues, consider removing or disabling them temporarily. Regularly update Microsoft Office applications to ensure you have the latest secure versions.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nKeep an eye on these repetitive file creations. If they continue and especially if you notice any unusual behavior from your Office applications, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for further assistance."}
