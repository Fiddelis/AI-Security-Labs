However, without additional context or further analysis, it's challenging to determine the exact threat level.\n- **Mitigation Steps:**\n  - Investigate the origin of these files. Check if they are part of legitimate software or if they were installed maliciously.\n  - Scan the system with up-to-date antivirus\/anti-malware software to identify and remove any potential threats.\n  - Monitor the system for unusual behavior, such as frequent file creation\/deletion or network activity.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nFurther investigation is required to assess the risk and take appropriate action.
