{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event shows.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connection and DNS queries. That seems normal since Chrome does a lot of networking. But then I notice powershell.exe popping up several times. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be abused by attackers.\n\nLooking closer at the PowerShell events: one has an unusual command line with XOR operations, which might indicate encryption or obfuscation. The script is creating and deleting a file quickly, which could be a way to avoid detection. Also, there are multiple registry accesses and image loads, which might suggest it's trying to hide its tracks or load malicious components.\n\nThe process accesses and creates files in the Temp directory, which is a common spot for temporary scripts. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks could mean they're modifying system configurations, possibly to maintain persistence.\n\nPutting this together, these activities don't look like normal user behavior. The combination of PowerShell with such specific and potentially malicious commands raises red flags. It's likely an attempt at lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe show signs of potential malicious activity, including a suspicious script execution with XOR operations and file creation\/deletion in the Temp directory.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what I've got here. There are several JSONL events to analyze. The first event shows a process named powershell.exe with a winlog task of Pipe Created. That's a bit generic, but PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the next six events, they all have similar command lines in powershell.exe. Each one seems to be running a script that does some XOR encryption on plaintext data. The plaintext includes \"Path\" followed by a username path like \"C:\\Users\\victim\". Then it uses a basic key of lowercase letters and numbers, which isn't very strong encryption.\n\nAfter encrypting the text, they set Expect100Continue to false and make a POST request to example.com. This makes me think the script is trying to send some data over the internet. The fact that it's using a simple cipher might be an attempt to obscure the data being sent, possibly exfiltrating sensitive information.\n\nThe winlog task in all these events is 'Provider Lifecycle', which relates to Windows event tracing or provider registration. Not sure if that's significant on its own, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it could indicate something fishy.\n\nI also notice that the same command line appears multiple times. Repeated identical scripts might be part of a batch process or an automated attack, suggesting possible malicious behavior like a botnet activity or data exfiltration attempts.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated use of powershell.exe with XOR encryption and POST requests to an external domain. This looks suspicious because it's not typical user activity. The encryption is weak, which might be intentional to avoid detection but isn't very effective. The batch of events overloading the system with similar actions could indicate a DDoS or data exfiltration attempt.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because it shows signs of potential malicious behavior through unusual PowerShell activity and data transmission patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing the same XOR encryption script to send data via POST requests, indicating potential exfiltration or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL logs here, each line representing an event.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines show some Base64 decoding and XOR operations. Hmm, encoding data in such ways is often a tactic to obfuscate malicious code so it's harder to detect.\n\nLooking closer at the process details, powershell.exe is executing scripts that perform bitwise XOR on plaintext with a key, which suggests an attempt to encode or decode something. The key used here is \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456\", which isn't too random but might be part of an encryption routine. After encoding, it's sending data to example.com via POST. That URL seems suspicious; if it's not a known legitimate service, especially with the way the data is being sent, it could be exfiltrating information.\n\nThere are also multiple events where powershell.exe loads different files and interacts with the registry. The fact that the same process is accessing various system components (like ImageLoad for DLLs) and making changes to the registry (RegistryEvent) adds to the suspicion. Malware often needs to persistence by modifying the registry or loading malicious scripts.\n\nOther processes like conhost.exe, calc.exe, notepad.exe, and svchost.exe are also appearing in these logs, which is a bit concerning. These are common system processes but could be indicators if they're behaving abnormally. For example, svchost.exe being linked to RegistryEvent might be normal for some services, but combined with the powershell activity, it raises an eyebrow.\n\nI should also note that there are two instances of winlogbeat.exe creating files, which might just be part of log shipping or monitoring tools, so maybe not directly malicious unless compromised. However, in this context, given the other activities, it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThe overall pattern seems to indicate a potential attempt at data exfiltration using obfuscated PowerShell commands. The repeated use of powershell.exe with similar command lines suggests a possible script being run multiple times or a loop in the code. The combination of encoding data and sending it over the network is classic for exfiltration, which is malicious behavior.\n\nConsidering all these points together, this batch does seem relevant for investigation. There's enough indication of potential malware activity that could pose a risk to the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes show suspicious command-line arguments involving Base64 decoding and XOR operations, potentially indicating malicious activity such as data encoding and exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events, processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe are all setting registry values. That in itself might not be suspicious if it's part of normal operation, but I should check how many times this happens.\n\nNext, there's a lot of chrome.exe activity—14 events where it sets registry values. Some also involve loading image files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. While these could be legitimate, the high number might raise an eyebrow. Maybe someone is trying to modify Chrome's behavior or inject something malicious.\n\nI see that whoami.exe was executed from the command line without any arguments. That's usually harmless unless it's part of a larger attack to gather user info.\n\nThere are several powershell.exe events with different tasks. One instance shows a command-line argument that tries to remove a file at a specific path, but the command is incomplete or maybe obfuscated. This could be an attempt to delete files without logging much activity, which might indicate malicious behavior.\n\nAlso, multiple ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks on powershell.exe suggest that another process is accessing it, possibly for elevation of privilege or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of unusual powershell.exe commands, high registry modifications by chrome.exe, and potential file deletion attempts makes this batch worth investigating. The confidence isn't too high because some events could be normal, but the red flags are present.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes (including powershell.exe) show suspicious activity such as registry modifications and file deletions, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of entries involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. So when I spot multiple instances of it in the logs, I need to pay attention.\n\nLooking closer, there are several events where powershell.exe loads different DLL files. The file paths seem normal at first glance—like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. But then again, these could be part of legitimate operations since PowerShell often uses .NET frameworks. However, the fact that multiple such entries exist might indicate some unusual activity.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of temporary files. There's a file being created in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_hngxvv3x.rso.ps1. Then it gets deleted right after. This seems suspicious because creating and then immediately deleting a script could be an attempt to avoid detection or persistence.\n\nMoreover, there are multiple command lines where powershell.exe is used with Remove-Item commands. These commands are trying to delete specific batch files from various paths. The use of -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore suggests that the user is trying to remove these files without any confirmation or error messages, which is a red flag. This behavior might be part of an attempt to clean up traces of malicious activity or remove competing scripts.\n\nAdditionally, while there are some entries from chrome.exe modifying registry values, this doesn't raise as many concerns on its own since browsers do modify the registry for updates and settings. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks might just be normal operations unless they're doing something unusual, which isn't clear here.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances loading various DLLs, creating and deleting temporary script files, and forcefully removing several batch files from different directories. These actions collectively seem like they could be part of a malicious payload trying to clean up after itself or modify system behavior in ways that aren't typical user activity.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the batch does appear relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe loading DLLs and performing file operations, including creating and deleting temporary files, along with removing several batch files.

I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at each event:\n\n1. **Powershell Execution**: The first few entries show `powershell.exe` being executed with command lines that remove specific files using `Remove-Item`. This could be suspicious because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, and deleting files can indicate tampering or data destruction.\n   \n2. **Process Creations**: There are multiple instances of processes like `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `sc.exe`, and `services.exe` being created. These tools can be legitimate but also have malicious uses. For example, `cmd.exe` is commonly used in command-line attacks, and `whoami.exe` could be used to gather information about the system.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Several events show registry values being set or objects added\/deleted by processes like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others. Registry modifications are often part of persistence mechanisms for malware, making this a red flag.\n\n4. **File Operations**: The deletion of specific files might be an attempt to cover tracks or remove evidence. The paths mentioned seem arbitrary but could be targeting certain scripts or configurations.\n\n5. **Multiple Process Accesses**: There are entries where `powershell.exe` accesses other processes, which might indicate process injection or lateral movement within the system.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- **Frequency of Suspicious Processes**: Multiple instances of `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and others being spawned could indicate a script running multiple commands.\n  \n- **File Deletions**: The repeated use of `Remove-Item` suggests that something is being cleaned up, possibly after malicious activity.\n\n- **Registry Changes**: These are concerning because attackers often modify the registry to maintain persistence or change system configurations.\n\n- **Lack of Legitimate Context**: While some processes like `services.exe` and `whoami.exe` can be part of normal operations, their combination with other suspicious activities raises concern.\n\nPotential Indicators:\n\n- The batch shows a sequence of actions that could be part of an attack chain: initial access (using powershell), lateral movement (accessing other processes), data destruction\/deletion, and persistence mechanisms through registry changes.\n\nPossible Concerns:\n\n- The events could be part of a script designed to remove evidence or disable security features, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n  \n- The use of `sc.exe` to stop and delete services might indicate attempts to disrupt system defenses or other services.\n\nWhile it's possible these actions are from legitimate scripts or administrative tasks, the combination of multiple high-risk processes, file deletions, and registry modifications without clear justification makes this batch warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious process creations, file deletions using PowerShell, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated accesses could be a red flag. Some of these entries show that powershell.exe accessed files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which might not be unusual, but when combined with other events, it could indicate something more.\n\nLooking further, there are several 'cmd.exe' processes running commands like deleting a file in the temp directory. This deletion is happening silently, which might be an attempt to remove traces of previous activities. The command line shows \"del \/A:H %temp%\\tarefa_logico.txt\", which deletes a specific file with hidden attribute. The use of \/A:H suggests they're targeting a hidden file, possibly trying to clean up logs or evidence.\n\nThen there's 'whoami.exe' being executed, which usually retrieves user information. While benign on its own, it could be part of a reconnaissance phase where an attacker is checking the system context. It's a common step in privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nI also see a powershell.exe process with a command line \"& {}\", which seems suspicious. Empty command lines in PowerShell often indicate that the script was executed without logging the actual command, possibly to avoid detection. This could be part of a larger script execution that isn't fully captured here.\n\nAnother point is the creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_14c001yd.l3m.ps1). The file is created and then deleted, which might indicate an attempt to test the system's policy or bypass certain security measures. This behavior could be part of a malicious payload trying to ensure it doesn't leave traces.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple PowerShell accesses, deletion commands, registry modifications (from RegistryEvent tasks), and script file creation\/deletion suggest a possible attack chain. These actions are often seen in initial access, credential dumping, or lateral movement phases of an attack.\n\nWhile each event on its own might not be conclusive, the combination raises concerns about potential malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell and cmd for file operations and process creations is a common tactic for attackers to maintain persistence and hide their tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing system files, deleting temporary files, and creating\/deleting script files suggest potential malicious activity.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe created a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. That sounds normal because it's likely the log shipping tool creating its configuration file.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries from powershell.exe with different tasks like Pipe Created and Provider Lifecycle. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so repeated events from it could be a red flag. But without more context, these might just be standard operations or scripts running.\n\nThere are several events where the command line for powershell.exe is \"& {}\", which doesn't look suspicious on its own but seems repetitive. The ImageLoad event loading MpClient.dll is normal as that's part of Windows Defender.\n\nThen, there's a FileCreate task by powershell.exe into a StartupProfileData file. That could be setting up some profile data, maybe for legitimate use or persistence mechanisms.\n\nRegistry value sets from both powershell.exe and conhost.exe are notable because attackers often manipulate the registry to maintain access or change system configurations. I need to check if these writes are normal or if they're modifying sensitive areas.\n\nA FileDeleteDetected event by cmd.exe deleting modulo_base.exe in the Temp folder stands out. Deletion of files, especially ones with generic names like 'modulo', could be part of cleaning up after malicious activities. This is a concerning sign because attackers might delete evidence to avoid detection.\n\nWhoami.exe running and creating processes under cmd.exe isn't inherently suspicious, but combined with other events, it might indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated powershell.exe activity, registry manipulations, and file deletion suggest potential malicious behavior.

Let me go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines show commands like Remove-Item, which deletes files. Specifically, they're targeting $env:TEMP\\key.log, which is an environment variable pointing to the TEMP directory.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, these events are happening consecutively, suggesting a sequence of actions by the same process. The deletion attempts might be part of a script trying to clean up traces or remove evidence after some malicious activity. The fact that they're using -ErrorAction Ignore means errors won't be shown, which is common in scripts meant to avoid detection.\n\nI also notice file creation and deletion events related to a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1). This could indicate the execution of a malicious script that's being deleted afterward to erase its tracks. Additionally, there are multiple registry accesses and image loads, which might be part of the script's operation or an attempt to persistence.\n\nThe repetitive nature of these events—like multiple Provider Lifecycle tasks and Engine Lifecycle events—is concerning. It suggests the process is running in a loop or as part of a larger script with multiple stages. Such behavior isn't typical for legitimate PowerShell usage and could be indicative of malicious activity aiming to avoid detection by spreading out actions over time.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are several red flags: repeated deletions of specific files, temporary script creation\/deletion, use of error suppression, and consistent process activity. These factors collectively suggest a high likelihood of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe deleting files in the TEMP directory, creating and immediately deleting temporary scripts, and accessing registry entries—indicators of potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of system logs is something I should look into further. So, looking at the events provided, there are a lot of PowerShell activities here.\n\nFirst off, I notice that multiple entries show 'powershell.exe' being executed with different command lines and tasks. Some have empty command lines or just '& {}', which seems unusual because typically you'd see some actual commands there. This makes me think that maybe the script is trying to hide its activity or perhaps it's part of a malicious payload.\n\nThere are several events where files are being created and deleted, like the file '__PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1' which was created and then quickly deleted. That seems suspicious because deleting a file right after creating it could be an attempt to avoid detection or perhaps it's part of some script execution process.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the use of 'whoami.exe'. While this command itself isn't malicious, its combination with PowerShell might indicate privilege escalation attempts or information gathering about the system. Plus, there are multiple registry writes and process accesses logged, which can be signs of persistence mechanisms or attempting to modify system configurations.\n\nI also see that some events mention 'MpClient.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll', which are related to Windows Defender. Malware sometimes targets these components to avoid detection or disrupt antivirus operations. The repeated loading of various .NET framework DLLs by PowerShell might be part of executing malicious scripts that require those libraries.\n\nPutting it all together, the high frequency of PowerShell activities with unusual command lines and file manipulations raises a red flag. These behaviors don't align with normal user activity and could indicate a potential cyberattack, such as script execution, persistence setup, or data exfiltration attempts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and empty command lines suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format to analyze. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening. The events seem to be related to processes and Windows logs. Many of them involve powershell.exe, which immediately raises a red flag because PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate scripting and for malicious activities like executing commands and creating payloads.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I see that the process is powershell.exe with an empty command line argument: {\"command_line\": \"powershell.exe & {}\"}. This looks suspicious because it's calling PowerShell without any obvious parameters. Typically, when you run a script or command in PowerShell, the command line would include those arguments. The use of \"&\" might be trying to execute something else, but since it's empty here, it's hard to tell.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is involved with various tasks like \"Provider Lifecycle,\" \"Engine Lifecycle,\" and others. These seem related to the internal workings of PowerShell, perhaps indicating that it's initializing or starting up. But I'm not entirely sure if these are normal or part of some malicious activity.\n\nI also notice a few entries where other processes are involved, like conhost.exe, whoami.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. For example, there's an event where whoami.exe is created: {\"command_line\": \"\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\whoami.exe\\\"\"} with the task \"Process Create.\" Whoami is a legitimate tool used to display user information, but in this context, it could be part of a larger script trying to gather system details or run with elevated privileges.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file: {\"task\": \"File created\", \"path\": \"...\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new\"}. Winlogbeat is likely a log management tool, possibly the Elastic Winlogbeat which ships Windows logs to Elasticsearch. The creation of this file seems normal unless it's being used in an unusual way.\n\nAnother point is the frequent occurrence of Registry value set tasks for both powershell.exe and conhost.exe: {\"task\": \"RegistryEvent\"}. Modifying registry entries can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malware to survive reboots. This adds some concern because if these processes are making changes to the system's configuration without a clear reason, it could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThe events where powershell.exe accesses other processes ({\"task\": \"ProcessAccess\"}) might indicate that PowerShell is interacting with other running processes, possibly injecting code or gathering information from them. This kind of behavior can be part of legitimate administration tasks but is also common in attacks to escalate privileges or spread within a network.\n\nI'm also noting the repetition of certain events, like multiple \"Process Create\" for whoami.exe and powershell.exe accessing other processes repeatedly. Repetitive actions, especially involving known tools like PowerShell, could suggest automated malicious activity or script execution.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows several red flags:\n1. Multiple instances of powershell.exe running without clear command-line arguments.\n2. Registry modifications which can be a sign of persistence.\n3. Use of whoami.exe to potentially gather system information.\n4. The combination of these activities could indicate a script or tool being used for lateral movement, data exfiltration, or setting up persistence.\n\nWhile each individual event might not necessarily be suspicious on its own, the pattern and frequency across the batch suggest a possible coordinated activity that merits closer investigation. However, there's no concrete evidence of malicious payload execution or direct signs of known attacks (like writing to unexpected files, network connections, etc.), so the confidence isn't extremely high.\n\nTherefore, considering all these points, I would classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" due to the concerning patterns, but with a moderate confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe without clear command-line arguments, registry modifications, and repetitive process creations suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is \"powershell.exe\" with tasks like \"Process accessed.\" PowerShell is often used both for legitimate administrative tasks and can be abused in malicious activities. The fact that it's accessed several times might indicate someone exploring the system or potentially executing commands.\n\nThen there are instances of \"whoami.exe\" being executed. Whoami is typically used to display user information, which seems benign on its own. However, when combined with other activities, especially from PowerShell, it could be part of a larger script trying to gather information about the system.\n\nLooking further, I see that one of the PowerShell events involves a registry value set. This could be significant because modifying the registry can allow persistence or configuration changes for malicious purposes. It's not common in normal operations unless an admin is tweaking settings.\n\nThere's also an event involving \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) used for log management. The creation of a new YAML file might be related to configuration changes or updates in the logging setup, which isn't inherently malicious but could be part of system instrumentation.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell accesses, registry modifications, and repeated whoami executions suggest potential exploration or script execution.
