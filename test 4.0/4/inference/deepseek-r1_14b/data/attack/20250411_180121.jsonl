Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. These seem normal because Chrome often makes network requests and DNS lookups as part of its operation. So nothing suspicious here on their own.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe events. One stands out because it includes a command line that's trying to download a file from a GitHub repository into the TEMP directory. That's a red flag because PowerShell is commonly used in scripts for malicious activities. The fact that it's downloading files without clear justification could indicate potential malware or script execution.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, which are normal when running scripts as they load necessary libraries. But combined with the file download attempts, this adds to the concern. Also, a FileCreate event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1 and immediately after that, a FileDeleteDetected event suggests the script might be attempting to remove evidence or test permissions.\n\nAdditionally, there are more powershell.exe events with similar command lines, each downloading different files from various GitHub repositories. This pattern of multiple downloads from raw.githubusercontent links is often used in malicious scripts to fetch components or payloads.\n\nConsidering all these together: repeated network connections from Chrome aren't concerning, but the PowerShell activities show a clear attempt to download and execute code from external sources, which could be part of an attack chain. The deletions after creation might be an attempt to evade detection or test if script execution is allowed.\n\nTherefore, this batch shows potential malicious activity that's definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show attempts to download files from external repositories, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple PowerShell processes with command lines that involve downloading files from GitHub repositories. Each command uses a different repository path but all seem related to downloading LICENSE.txt files into the TEMP directory under various names like \"tarefa_geral.txt\". This could be concerning because downloading files from external sources via scripts can indicate malicious activity, especially if they're being saved in temporary directories which are often used for executing code.\n\nLooking further, some events show changes in file creation related to PowerShell profiles and startup data. For example, there's a FileCreate event when 'powershell.exe' creates a file at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\...\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. This might be part of establishing persistence or loading malicious scripts upon startup.\n\nThere are also multiple Registry value sets from both PowerShell and Chrome. The fact that Chrome is making several registry changes could indicate some form of tampering, though it's less suspicious than direct file downloads. However, the volume of these events (seven times) from the same process might raise eyebrows.\n\nAnother point is a DNS query event, which is common in malicious activities to check for domains or command and control servers. Although it's not directly linked to other events here, it adds to the suspicion when combined with the others.\n\nAdditionally, there are ImageLoad events indicating that PowerShell is loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. This isn't inherently suspicious, but if combined with other indicators, it might suggest an attempt to bypass or manipulate existing security measures.\n\nI also notice a 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a config file, which could be part of legitimate log management but could also be used maliciously to exfiltrate data or disrupt logging mechanisms.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell instances downloading files, changes in system configurations and registries, and a DNS query. These activities collectively show signs that might be indicative of an attack. The repeated downloads from GitHub repositories with filenames like LICENSE.txt (which are often used as placeholders) further suggest they might contain malicious payloads.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes downloading files from different GitHub repositories, changes in file creation and registry values, and a DNS query event suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe accessing files, registry values, and other processes. Powershell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so unusual activity here could be a red flag. I notice several instances where powershell.exe is accessing or modifying the registry, which can be part of malicious activities like persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThen there's an event with whoami.exe being executed. While this is generally benign, it's often used by attackers to check permissions, so in combination with other events, it might indicate reconnaissance.\n\nLooking further, I see cmd.exe and schtasks.exe being used. The command line for cmd.exe shows a SCHTASKS command deleting a task named \"spawn\". Scheduling tasks that are deleted could be part of persistence mechanisms or an attempt to remove traces after execution. Also, the use of redirecting output to nul suggests an effort to hide activity, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nThere are also several instances where svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe modify registry values. Svchost.exe is a legitimate process but can be used maliciously byDLLs or services it hosts, making such changes suspicious if unexplained.\n\nOther events include notepad.exe accessing the registry, which is unusual since notepad isn't typically involved in system configuration. Calc.exe loading urlmon.dll might seem normal, but combined with other anomalies, it could indicate something more.\n\nOverall, the batch shows multiple process creations and file\/registry modifications, especially by powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and schtasks.exe. These activities could be part of a script or toolset used in attacks, such as creating\/moving files, accessing system information, or establishing persistence. The presence of deleted scheduled tasks and hidden output redirection adds to the suspicion.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there's enough concerning activity that warrants further investigation. The combination suggests potential malicious behavior rather than normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe accessing files and registry values, along with suspicious command-line arguments in cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see several instances where powershell.exe is being executed. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both legitimately and maliciously. The fact that it's accessed multiple times might be normal, but the frequency could raise some flags.\n\nLooking at specific commands, there are attempts to delete registry entries using cmd.exe and reg.exe. For example, deleting \"modulo_temporario\" and \"pacote_auxiliar\" from HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. These registry keys are typically used by applications to run on startup. Malware often tries to remove its own traces or other malicious entries to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there's a command where powershell.exe is executed with an ampersand and empty curly braces: \"powershell.exe & {}\". This looks suspicious because using \"&\" can sometimes be used in command injection or to chain commands. The empty curly braces might be part of obfuscating the actual command that follows, which isn't shown here.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of conhost.exe, whoami.exe, and cmd.exe. These are standard utilities, but their combination with other scripts like powershell could indicate attempts at privilege escalation or information gathering.\n\nThe events also show multiple registry accesses and modifications. Frequent writes to the registry might be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure it runs on each startup.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple process creations for powershell.exe, cmd.exe deleting registry entries, hidden powershell executions—this pattern suggests potential malicious activity. The combination indicates possible persistence, data exfiltration attempts, or installation of backdoors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell execution, suspicious command lines, and registry modifications indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

First, I notice that a lot of the entries involve powershell.exe loading various .NET framework components and interacting with files. While PowerShell is commonly used for malicious activities, it's also a legitimate tool, so single instances might not be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where PowerShell creates temporary files in %Temp%, which could indicate script execution. However, this activity alone isn't conclusive without additional context like failed executions or other indicators of compromise.\n\nI see that after creating a file, it's immediately deleted. This might suggest an attempt to bypass certain security policies, such as scripting restrictions. The creation and deletion within a short timeframe could be a red flag, but again, it depends on the environment's normal behavior.\n\nThere are also events involving other processes like winlogbeat.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, and conhost.exe. These might just be legitimate system operations or part of a larger script execution flow. Without evidence of unusual command lines or multiple failed attempts, these don't raise high suspicions.\n\nConsidering all the events together, while there are some concerning signs—like file creation\/deletion in Temp and registry modifications—it's not clear if this indicates malicious activity. It could be a legitimate process or an attempt to test system defenses without crossing into actual exploitation.\n\nI'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING because each individual action might be part of normal operations, even though together they seem suspicious.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is cmd.exe setting a registry value. That could be normal admin activity but might also be malicious. Next up is conhost.exe doing the same with the registry. Conhost isn't typically malicious, so maybe that's just part of legitimate operations.\n\nThen there's PowerShell accessing processes and creating new instances multiple times. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The repeated process creations and accesses are red flags.\n\nI notice several events where PowerShell is loading different DLLs. This could be a sign of malicious scripts trying to load components or bypassing security measures. Additionally, the file operations—creating and then deleting a script file in Temp—suggest some kind of script execution might have happened. Attackers often use such techniques to test if they can run scripts without being detected.\n\nLooking at the last event, ApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying the registry is unusual because it's typically associated with UI components. This could be an attempt to hide processes or alter system behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, multiple instances of PowerShell activity with file and registry changes, along with a process creation for conhost and cmd.exe, indicate potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's see what's here.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice a lot of processes being created by powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is commonly used for malicious activities. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is creating new processes and accessing other processes like chrome.exe and whoami.exe. Also, there are file operations—like creating files in the user's AppData folder—which might be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing I spot is Registry value sets. Malware often uses the registry to maintain persistence or change system configurations. The fact that both powershell.exe and other processes are modifying the registry could indicate malicious behavior.\n\nThere are also some image loads, like MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll. While these might be legitimate, sometimes attackers load malicious libraries into processes, so it's worth looking into.\n\nThe command lines for some powershell.exe instances have strange arguments, like using ampersands and removing a file in the TEMP directory. This kind of activity can be used to delete logs or evidence of their presence on the system.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where conhost.exe is modifying the registry. Conhost is usually related to command-line interfaces, but its use here might not be normal, especially alongside powershell.exe activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with suspicious arguments and file operations, combined with registry modifications and process accesses, suggests potential malicious activity. This batch definitely needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious activities including registry modifications, file creations, and process access.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system log events. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs. These include mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll. PowerShell using these might be normal for running scripts, but sometimes attackers use it to execute malicious code. However, on its own, loading .NET framework components isn't suspicious.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the TEMP directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. Then immediately after, it's deleted. Creating and then deleting a script could be part of testing permissions or avoiding detection. This might warrant closer look, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at command lines, there are multiple Remove-Item commands targeting files in the TEMP directory with .zip extensions. The specific paths like tarefa_base.zip, componente_comum.zip, etc., seem repetitive and structured. Deleting temporary zip files could be part of a cleanup routine after extracting files, which is common for both legitimate scripts and malware.\n\nSome events mention \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks from chrome.exe and powershell.exe. These are usually related to process initialization or termination, not indicative of malicious activity on their own.\n\nHowever, the combination of creating a PowerShell script in TEMP, immediately deleting it, and then repeatedly deleting other .zip files in TEMP is concerning. This pattern could suggest an attempt to remove evidence or execute arbitrary code that's been extracted from the zip files. Malware often deletes its traces after execution to avoid detection.\n\nWhile each individual event might not be suspicious, together they form a narrative of potential malicious activity. The repeated deletions and temporary script creation are red flags. Therefore, this batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe loading .NET components, creating\/deleting a temp PowerShell script, and deleting files in the TEMP directory.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether this batch of system events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is running with command lines that delete files in the TEMP directory. For example, \"Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\tarefa_base.txt -Force...\" These look like they're trying to remove specific files, which could be part of malicious activity since scripts often delete traces.\n\nThen I notice some events where PowerShell accesses processes and modifies registry values. This is a bit concerning because legitimate scripts usually don't modify the registry unless installing something. The combination of process access and registry changes might indicate privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere are several instances of \"File created\" and then immediately \"File Delete logged\". Creating a file just to delete it could be part of a script's operation, but in this case, since they're deleting specific files, it might be an attempt to cover tracks or remove evidence.\n\nLooking at the image loading events from powershell.exe, these are normal as PowerShell loads various DLLs. However, the sheer number of these events and their timing alongside deletions could suggest unusual behavior.\n\nThe use of conhost.exe in some entries is interesting too. Conhost is often used by scripts to create a host process for console applications. It's not inherently malicious, but when combined with other activities like file deletion, it raises suspicion.\n\nAlso, the repeated use of powershell.exe commands to delete files across different events could indicate automation or script execution. If these were legitimate admin tasks, they might appear more spread out and in a controlled manner.\n\nOverall, while some events on their own might not be suspicious, the combination—multiple file deletions from TEMP, registry changes, process access, and repeated powershell.exe usage—creates a pattern that suggests potential malicious activity.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where PowerShell is being used with commands like Remove-Item on temporary files. These are in the process field with command lines pointing to specific .txt files in the TEMP directory. This might indicate some file deletion activity, but it's possible this is part of normal cleanup processes or script execution. However, since they're using Powershell and removing files without error logging, it could be a red flag for potential malicious behavior trying to cover its tracks.\n\nNext, there are events where Powershell.exe loads the MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems benign because MpClient is part of Windows Defender's operation, so that's probably normal.\n\nThere's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the data directory. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log shipping and management, so this isn't unusual unless there's something suspicious about how it's being used here, which I don't see right now.\n\nThen, there are multiple instances of chrome.exe making registry changes. While Chrome does modify the registry when installing updates or extensions, multiple such events could be concerning if they're not part of an expected update process. However, without more context on what exactly is being changed, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe execution which seems straightforward as it's typically used for user identification. Unless it's being run in an unexpected context or with elevated privileges, I don't see immediate issues here.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where Powershell.exe accesses other processes and creates files. This could be part of legitimate script execution but might also be a sign of lateral movement or process injection if combined with other activities.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, the repeated use of Powershell to delete files in TEMP without any associated error handling stands out. Malware often uses such techniques to remove traces of its activity. Also, multiple registry modifications by Chrome could indicate persistence mechanisms, though it's more likely related to browser updates or settings changes.\n\nThe combination of Powershell deletions and the other events might suggest a potential attack vector. However, without evidence of known malicious behavior (like creation of suspicious files, network connections, or known indicators of compromise), it's hard to be certain. The confidence level is medium because while some activities are concerning, they could also be legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands deleting files in TEMP directory and registry modifications by Chrome suggest potential malicious activity or unusual behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are about powershell.exe being accessed and whoami.exe being created as a process. Specifically, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessed with ProcessAccess events, which usually indicates some kind of activity in PowerShell, maybe script execution or command-line operations. Then, whoami.exe is created several times, each time from the same path \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\". That's a standard system file, so nothing suspicious there on the surface.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many ProcessAccess events for PowerShell? Sometimes that could be normal if someone is using it frequently, but in cybersecurity, too many accesses can be a red flag. Maybe an attacker is running multiple commands or scripts through PowerShell, which is a common tool for malicious activities because of its powerful scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands.\n\nAlso, I notice that towards the end, there's an event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal if it's part of the log management setup, but considering the other events, maybe it's worth checking if this is related or just another process running as expected.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a text file named pacote_ativo.txt by powershell.exe. The filename doesn't seem suspicious at first glance, but sometimes attackers use such files to store malicious scripts or data. Since it's created via PowerShell, which we already noted could be concerning, this adds another layer to consider.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe and creation of a file by it might indicate scripting activity, which is often used in attacks. The repetition suggests potential automation or bulk operations, which could be malicious. While individual events aren't necessarily bad, the combination raises suspicion. Therefore, this batch should probably be classified as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe and file creation suggest potential scripting activity, which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
