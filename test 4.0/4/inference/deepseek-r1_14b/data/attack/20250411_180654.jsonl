{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event is about.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe modifying registry values. That's a bit unusual because Chrome doesn't typically need to set registry values that often, especially in bulk like nine times. It could be related to some extension or update, but it might also indicate something more malicious.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a legitimate tool used to get user information, so alone it's not suspicious, but combined with other events from powershell.exe, it might be part of an attack chain.\n\nLooking at the powershell.exe entries, some command lines are invoking scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name suggests it's designed to capture keystrokes, which is a clear sign of malicious activity—keyloggers are often used for espionage or theft.\n\nThere are also several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs. While PowerShell does load libraries when executing scripts, the combination with external scripts and repeated registry writes raises concern.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where powershell.exe is creating a temporary file. Temporary files can be part of legitimate operations, but again, coupled with other suspicious activities, it's a red flag.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple registry modifications from Chrome, execution of whoami and powershell scripts that suggest data collection (keylogging), and repeated process accesses and image loads—this batch shows a pattern that could indicate malicious behavior. The confidence is high because several indicators point towards potential compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts, including registry modifications and file creation, which are indicative of suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is 'powershell.exe' with various command lines. Each command line includes a path to a .ps1 file, specifically Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name sounds suspicious because \"Get-Keystrokes\" implies it's designed to capture keystrokes, which is a common tactic for malware aiming to steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card details.\n\nLooking at the command lines, each one points to different paths on the system:\n- C:\\objeto_secundario\\tarefa_padrao\\tarefa_principal\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\n- C:\\registro_ativo\\tarefa_temporario\\estrutura_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\nAnd so on. The varying paths suggest that the script might be trying to run from multiple locations, possibly indicating an attempt to evade detection by spreading out its components or testing different execution points.\n\nAdditionally, some events show file creation and deletion activities related to PowerShell scripts:\n- File created for __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1\n- Then the same file is deleted shortly after. This pattern is often used in malicious activity to test if certain scripts are allowed or to remove evidence after execution.\n\nThere's also an event where 'Execute a Remote Command' is logged, pointing to another Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script. This indicates potential remote execution attempts, which could be part of a larger attack vector, such as remote access tools or command-and-control communication.\n\nOther events include loading of DLLs by Windows Defender processes (MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll). While Defender is a legitimate process, the repeated loading might be worth investigating to ensure it's not being exploited or used as a persistence mechanism.\n\nMoreover, there are registry value sets from both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence techniques where malware ensures it runs on subsequent system boots.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts aimed at capturing keystrokes, along with file creation\/deletion patterns that could indicate attempts to hide traces. The repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths and remote command execution adds to the suspicion. While some activities might be benign (like legitimate script testing), the combination raises red flags about possible malicious intent.\n\nHowever, without more context on the user's environment or additional indicators like timestamps showing activity over a short period, it's challenging to definitively classify this as malicious. But given the repetitive and suspicious patterns, it leans towards being interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts across different paths, along with file creation\/deletion activities and remote command execution, suggest potential malicious behavior aimed at capturing keystrokes and evading detection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system logs to analyze. There are three events here, each in JSONL format. My job is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first event: The process is svchost.exe, which is a common Windows process often used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. The task is 'File created', and the file path is C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\State\\keyValueLKG.dat. Hmm, that's a bit deep into the system directories. Svchost.exe writing to such a specific file might be normal, but I should keep an eye on it.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe, which is typically associated with log shipping tools like ELK Stack. The task is again 'File created', and the path points to a .winlogbeat.yml.new file in a user's downloads directory. That seems a bit off because winlogbeat shouldn't be creating files in user directories unless it's configured that way, which might indicate tampering or misuse.\n\nThe third event runs powershell.exe, another process often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The task is 'File created', and the file path is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_padrao.txt. PowerShell creating a new text file in the user's downloads could be normal, but given that it's next to an unusual winlogbeat activity, I'm starting to see a pattern.\n\nPutting it all together: We have three different processes—svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and powershell.exe—all performing file creation tasks. The paths involved aren't typical for these processes. Svchost writing in system directories could be part of legitimate operations but might also signal something's wrong. Winlogbeat creating a config file in the user's downloads is suspicious because it's not where I'd expect log files to go, especially under a default setup.\n\nThe combination here raises red flags. Malware often uses multiple processes and creates files in unexpected locations to establish persistence or exfiltrate data. Each event on its own might be explainable, but together they paint a picture of potentially malicious activity. The confidence isn't super high because none of these events are outright conclusive, but the clustering around file creation by different suspicious processes increases the likelihood that something is amiss.\n\nSo, I'd classify this batch as interesting because the combination suggests possible malicious behavior rather than just normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) creating files in unusual locations, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
