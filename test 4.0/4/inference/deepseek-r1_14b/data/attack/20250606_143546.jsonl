{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe accessing something, but nothing unusual there since PowerShell is commonly used both benignly and maliciously. The next event is whoami.exe running without any command-line arguments. That seems normal; it's a standard system info tool.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and creating processes. This repetition might be concerning because attackers often use such scripts in loops to execute malicious commands. One of the events shows a PowerShell script with a specific command line, which includes an imported module from a path like \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..\". That path looks suspiciously long and uses backslashes that could indicate an attempt to hide the actual location or maybe an evasion technique.\n\nLooking further, there's a file creation event in the Temp directory for a PowerShell script. The naming pattern __PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1 suggests it might be testing something related to script policy enforcement, which is often a red flag because attackers might try to bypass such policies.\n\nThen, the same script is deleted shortly after creation, which raises questions about why it was created in the first place only to be removed. This behavior could indicate an attempt to avoid detection or to execute some malicious code temporarily.\n\nThere are also several image load events for various DLLs when PowerShell runs, which is normal. However, combined with the other events, it adds up. The creation and deletion of files in the Temp directory along with registry accesses might be part of a script's execution flow, possibly trying to elevate privileges or perform actions that require certain permissions.\n\nThe last few events involve svchost.exe creating a log file and modifying the registry, which on its own isn't suspicious since svchost is a legitimate process. But when combined with the other PowerShell activities, it could imply some form of persistence or service manipulation.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts, especially ones that are created and deleted quickly, importing modules from questionable paths, and interacting with both files and the registry—these all point towards potentially malicious activity. The confidence here is high because such patterns are often seen in attack campaigns where adversaries use script-based techniques to execute payloads and cover their tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious command lines, file operations in Temp directory, and registry access suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where different processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, and svchost.exe are setting registry values. Registry modifications can be tricky because legitimate software often changes registry settings during normal operation. However, malicious actors might also use the registry to hide or modify configurations. But seeing these common system processes doing this doesn't immediately raise a red flag.\n\nNext, I notice that powershell.exe is involved in both creating files and setting registry values. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused for malicious purposes. The file path mentioned is related to the user's profile under AppData, which is typical for PowerShell profiles. However, without more context on what exactly was done with PowerShell, it's hard to say if this activity is suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances where svchost.exe creates files in a SoftwareDistribution Download folder. The paths look like they're related to update processes or Windows components. Since svchost.exe is a common system process that hosts various services, these file creations could be part of normal operations, especially during updates or system checks.\n\nAlso, multiple events show image loads for urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll by different processes. These are legitimate DLL files used by Windows for URL handling and BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service). Processes like svchost.exe loading these modules is expected behavior, so this doesn't seem concerning on its own.\n\nThe file paths created by svchost.exe under the Download directory all have names ending with .dll, which suggests they're part of a legitimate update process. Microsoft often uses such naming conventions for components during updates or servicing. There's no indication here that these files are malicious or part of an exploit chain.\n\nConsidering all events together, there's a lot of normal system activity involving common processes and standard operations like file creation and registry modifications. Without any anomalies like access to unexpected locations, execution of unknown binaries, or signs of privilege escalation, the batch doesn't show clear indicators of malicious behavior.\n\nHowever, I can't entirely rule out suspicion because some activities, like PowerShell usage and multiple registry writes, are areas where attackers often operate. But based on the information provided, these actions don't deviate from what's typically expected in a healthy system environment.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes performing typical activities such as registry modifications and file creation related to updates.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first thing that stands out is that almost all the events involve svchost.exe. I know svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but it's often used by malware to hide their activities because many services run under it.\n\nLooking at the tasks performed: there are multiple instances where registry values were set and files were created. The files being created have paths like C:\\Windows\\Logs\\waasmedic... and C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download..., which seem unusual. These locations aren't typical for standard Windows operations, so that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, I notice several file creation events in the same path, which might indicate that something is downloading or storing multiple files in an unexpected location. This could be part of malicious activity where files are being cached or stored temporarily before being executed.\n\nThe repetition of Registry value sets by svchost.exe is concerning too. Malware often modifies registry entries to maintain persistence or change system configurations without user consent. The combination of these events happening multiple times across different timestamps makes me think there's a pattern here that isn't normal.\n\nConsidering the overall behavior, it seems like the system might be dealing with malicious activity using svchost.exe as a front. This batch could indicate an ongoing attack where files are being written to non-standard locations and registry modifications are made for persistence or other malicious purposes.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show svchost.exe performing unusual file creation and registry modifications in atypical paths, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **svchost.exe** is creating files in `C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install`. That path seems suspicious because it's a known location used by Windows Update and sometimes exploited by malware. The first event shows the creation of an executable file, `AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe`, which is unusual for svchost to create.\n\n2. Moving on, **MpSigStub.exe** is related to Microsoft Defender. It's performing several file creations in a temporary directory under `C:\\Windows\\Temp`. The filenames like `mpasdlta.vdm` and `mpavdlta.vdm` look like they might be part of legitimate update processes, but the volume of activity could indicate something suspicious.\n\n3. **setup.exe** is creating multiple files for Microsoft EdgeCore in different subdirectories. These seem normal as setup executables typically create configuration or helper files during installation or updates.\n\n4. There's an event from **MsMpEng.exe**, another Defender-related process, which is loading a DLL file. This seems standard unless the path looks tampered with, but it doesn't here.\n\n5. Finally, **RuntimeBroker.exe** and **powershell.exe** are accessing registry values. While RuntimeBroker is part of Windows' User Account Control, powershell.exe access could be malicious if used inappropriately, but without more context on what PowerShell is doing, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the combination, there are multiple processes (svchost.exe and MpSigStub.exe) creating files in areas that could be exploited. The svchost activity stands out because it's writing an executable in a sensitive location. Additionally, the defender-related processes creating many temp files might be masking malicious activities or part of a larger payload deployment.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the combination of these events—especially the svchost.exe activity and multiple file creations by different processes—could indicate potential malware attempting to hide or spread. The confidence is around 80% because while some activities are normal, others raise red flags that need closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** INTERESTING  \n**Confidence Level:** 80%\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Events:**\n\n1. **svchost.exe Creating Files in `C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install`:**\n   - **Event Details:** The creation of an executable file (`AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe`) under this path is unusual.\n   - **Suspicion Level:** High\n     - `svchost.exe` is a known process that can be exploited by malware to hide malicious activities.\n     - The path `C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution` is often associated with Windows Update, which attackers sometimes target.\n\n2. **MpSigStub.exe Creating Files in Temporary Directory:**\n   - **Event Details:** Multiple files are being created under `C:\\Windows\\Temp`, including `.vdm` and `.dll` extensions.\n   - **Suspicion Level:** Medium\n     - While `MpSigStub.exe` is part of Microsoft Defender, the volume and naming of these files could indicate suspicious activity.\n\n3. **setup.exe Creating Files for Microsoft Edge:**\n   - **Event Details:** Normal setup activities for Microsoft EdgeCore components.\n   - **Suspicion Level:** Low\n     - This is expected behavior during software installation or updates.\n\n4. **MsMpEng.exe Loading Defender DLL:**\n   - **Event Details:** Standard operation for the Defender engine.\n   - **Suspicion Level:** Low\n     - No red flags in this activity.\n\n5. **RuntimeBroker.exe and powershell.exe Registry Access:**\n   - **Event Details:** Registry value modifications could be part of legitimate operations or malicious activities.\n   - **Suspicion Level:** Medium (especially for `powershell.exe`)\n     - PowerShell is often used by attackers for command-line execution and lateral movement.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of these events, particularly the suspicious file creation by `svchost.exe` in a sensitive directory and unusual activity by `MpSigStub.exe`, suggests potential malicious behavior. While some activities are benign, others require further investigation to rule out an attack."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe being run with command-line arguments that seem suspicious. The process is creating a new service using New-Service cmdlet, which could be a sign of malicious activity as adversaries often create persistent backdoors this way.\n\nThen, I notice that powershell.exe is accessing the registry and loading several image files. While some are legitimate .NET framework components, others might not be necessary for standard operations. The creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file in C:\\Users\\... suggests script execution, which could indicate malicious behavior like testing policy bypasses.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry value set events from services.exe. This could mean someone is trying to modify system configurations or install services without proper authorization.\n\nConsidering all these together—suspicious process creation, registry modifications, temporary file handling—it's likely a coordinated attack attempt. The repeated actions and the nature of the commands make me confident that this batch requires investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activity involving powershell.exe including process creation with command-line arguments, registry modifications, file operations, and potential persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

This seems normal as these are common system processes and their associated DLLs.\n\nThen there are several events involving powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory. While PowerShell can be used maliciously, just creating a profile isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking further, I see registry value sets and remote command executions pointing to \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The repeated execution of this script, especially with error handling and a sleep command, raises flags. This could indicate the script is attempting persistence or performing malicious actions.\n\nThe high number of similar PowerShell command lines executing the same script suggests automation or an attempt to run it multiple times, which might be part of a larger campaign or attack vector.\n\nConsidering all these points together, while some individual events are normal, the combination—especially the repeated script execution and remote commands—is concerning.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm looking at these system logs and trying to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events where PowerShell is being used. The command lines show scripts being executed, like importing modules and invoking functions. Specifically, the script paths mention \"registro_comum\" and \"registro_secundario\", which translate to \"common log\" and \"secondary log\". That's a bit generic, but I wonder if that's normal or if it's part of something malicious.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's using powershell.exe to run a script that imports a module and tries to execute a function called Invoke-entrada_principal. The fact that there's a try-catch block might indicate that they're trying to handle exceptions, which is common in both good and bad scripts. But I'm more concerned about the use of PowerShell for executing arbitrary code, as it's often used by attackers.\n\nThen, I see multiple events where New-Service is being called with \"objeto_ativo\" as the service name. Creating new services can be a way to persistence, which is a red flag in security. If an attacker creates a service that starts on boot, they could maintain access. The binary path points to C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe, which again uses \"log\" and \"base\". Not sure if that's legitimate or part of a malicious payload.\n\nLooking further down, there are several events where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command', and the file path points to C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. This script seems to be executed multiple times, which might indicate repeated attempts to run it. The fact that it's being executed remotely could mean someone trying to execute code from another machine, which is suspicious.\n\nThe process field in some events is None, but the file paths are specific and repeat the same PS1 script. Repeated execution of the same remote command could be an attempt at persistence or just testing if the command works every time.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell executions with new service creations and repeated remote command executions. These activities don't seem to be part of normal system operations. They look like they could be setting up a backdoor (with the service) and potentially executing malicious scripts (the remote commands). The volume of events—nine times trying to execute that PS script—is concerning because it might indicate an automated or persistent attack.\n\nI'm not seeing any clear indicators of legitimate activity here. All signs point towards possible malicious behavior, like persistence mechanisms and remote code execution. So, I think this batch is definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions, new service creations, and repeated remote command executions indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I'm looking at the data provided, which consists of multiple JSONL entries.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events have \"winlog\" tasks related to executing remote commands and accessing a specific file path: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. This script is being executed multiple times across different events.\n\nThe repetition makes me think it's part of normal operations, perhaps an automated process or a legitimate script run by the system. However, executing remote commands repeatedly could be a sign of suspicious activity, especially if the file path isn't commonly used for such tasks.\n\nAdditionally, there are a couple of entries where \"process\" is 'services.exe' with logon events. Services.exe is a known Windows process for services, so this might just be service-related logins and aren't necessarily malicious on their own.\n\nConsidering all these points, while some elements could raise flags, the repetition suggests it might not be an immediate threat but could still warrant closer monitoring to ensure there's no underlying malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated execution of a script file, possibly indicating suspicious or automated behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm supposed to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, each event has \"process\": \"None\", which probably means there was no associated process detected. Then there's \"winlog\" with a 'task' field set to 'Execute a Remote Command'. That sounds suspicious because executing remote commands can be a sign of malicious activity, like command-line attacks or remote execution vulnerabilities.\n\nThe file path in each event is the same: 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1'. This script name translates to something like \"Secondary Logical Unit's Secondary Registration Auxiliary Component\". The fact that the same file is involved repeatedly could indicate an attempt to run this script multiple times, possibly as part of a larger attack.\n\nI notice there are 14 events where 'Execute a Remote Command' is logged, each referencing the same .ps1 file. Then, there are two entries with different tasks: one logs 'None', and another uses 'Windows Update Agent'. The last entry again has 'Execute a Remote Command' but no file path.\n\nHmm, the repetition of the same task and file path might indicate an automated or script-based attack trying to execute commands multiple times. This could be part of credential stuffing, lateral movement, or setting up persistence. Since each event is similar, it's possible they're part of a single attack campaign trying different approaches.\n\nThe confidence level is high because seeing the same command repeated so many times with consistent file paths suggests malicious intent. It's not just a one-off; the volume and consistency make it more likely to be an attack rather than normal activity.\n\nSo, overall, this batch should be classified as INTERESTING due to the suspicious task executions and repeated file access, which are red flags for potential malware or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated attempts to execute a remote command involving the same script path, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
