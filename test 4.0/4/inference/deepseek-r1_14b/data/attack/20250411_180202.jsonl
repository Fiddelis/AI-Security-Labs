{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180202.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break down each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe accessing something with ProcessAccess. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. Then there's whoami.exe being run, which on its own isn't too suspicious since it's often used to check user permissions. But seeing it in combination with other things might be worth noting.\n\nNext, another powershell.exe ProcessAccess event—so maybe multiple instances or repeated access attempts? Not sure yet. There's a RegistryEvent for setting a registry value via PowerShell, which could indicate persistence mechanisms or configuration changes that shouldn't happen normally.\n\nThen, cmd.exe is used with \/c wmic process call create notepad.exe. WMIC is often abused in attacks because it allows remote command execution. Using it to create Notepad might seem benign, but when combined with other commands, it's a concern. Also, the use of 'cmd.exe' as a shell can be a common tactic for attackers.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event, and then cmd.exe again setting another registry value. This repetition makes me think there's a pattern here—maybe an attacker is using multiple scripts or tools to establish persistence or lateral movement.\n\nLooking further, WMIC.exe is loading several DLLs. The first one is urlmon.dll, which handles URL parsing, but when loaded by suspicious processes, it could be part of exploit chains. AMSI DLL is related to antivirus, so maybe trying to bypass detection? Then there are Windows Defender Platform DLLs being loaded—could indicate attempts to load malicious modules or inject into legitimate processes.\n\nwmiprvse.exe setting a registry value—this process is associated with WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation), which is often targeted by attackers for remote control. Any unusual activity here should be flagged.\n\nNotepad.exe creation via command line could be a decoy, but if it's spawned by malicious processes like WMIC or cmd, that's concerning. It might be used to execute scripts or store malicious content temporarily.\n\nCmd.exe again setting another registry value—this repetition of using cmd and WMIC for registry changes is making me think an attacker is trying to establish persistence or modify system configurations without user knowledge.\n\nConhost.exe is also setting a registry value. Conhost is part of the Windows Console, but seeing it interact with the registry might be unusual unless running specific scripts. Could be another vector for attack.\n\nPowershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_temporario.txt'—temporary files created by scripts can be used to store malicious data or stage payloads. The path here is in the user's Downloads, which seems odd for system processes.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file—it's likely part of log management, but if it's behaving abnormally, could be a tool being misused. However, without more context, this might not be as suspicious.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value—I know Runtime Broker is related to user accounts and UAC elevation, so any unexpected registry changes here should be looked into, possibly for privilege escalation.\n\nAnother powershell.exe RegistryEvent—so it's modifying the registry again. Combining all these events, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe accessing processes, creating files, and modifying the registry. WMIC is used to load DLLs which could be part of an exploit or persistence mechanism. The repeated use of these tools in sequence suggests a potential attack chain.\n\nOverall, the combination of process creations, file accesses, and registry modifications by known malicious vectors like PowerShell and WMIC indicates that this batch might be part of a coordinated attack. While some events alone might not be alarming, together they paint a picture of possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes, creating files, and modifying the registry; cmd.exe used with WMIC for potential command execution; suspicious file creation and DLL loading activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
