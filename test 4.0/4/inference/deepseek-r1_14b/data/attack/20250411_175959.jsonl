{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few events are from chrome.exe with network connection detections and DNS queries. These seem normal because Chrome often connects to the internet and makes DNS requests. Not suspicious on their own.\n\nThen, there's a process create event for powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it can also be abused by attackers. The command line looks like it's running a script that does several things: checking local users, groups, listing files in C:\\Users, etc. This could be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking at the events after the process create, there are multiple registry access and image load tasks from powershell.exe. These might indicate the script is trying to interact with system configurations or loading modules, which isn't necessarily bad but could be if it's attempting unauthorized changes.\n\nThe file creation and deletion of a temporary .ps1 script in C:\\Users\\... suggests that the script is being written and then deleted. This behavior can be concerning because it might indicate an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving evidence or to bypass certain security policies.\n\nAlso, there are multiple provider lifecycle events from powershell.exe, which could relate to module loading or other process-related activities. While not inherently malicious, repeated such events alongside other actions might raise flags.\n\nPutting this all together: The batch shows a script running in PowerShell that enumerates users and groups, checks for local accounts, retrieves password hashes (cmdkey.exe \/list), lists files in user directories, and possibly more. These actions are common in attack patterns where an adversary is gathering information about the system to move laterally or escalate privileges.\n\nThe fact that the script creates a temporary file and then deletes it could be an attempt to avoid detection. Additionally, using multiple image load events might suggest the script is loading various components or modules, which could be part of obfuscation techniques.\n\nWhile isolated events can sometimes be false positives, the combination here—specifically the use of powershell.exe with a command line that performs extensive system enumeration and file operations—raises concerns. This pattern is more indicative of potential malicious activity rather than normal user behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts, including system enumeration and temporary file creation\/deletion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is powershell.exe with specific command lines. The command line includes commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-localgroupmember -group Users', and others. These look like they could be part of legitimate system administration tasks, but I know that PowerShell can also be used for malicious activities. For example, enumerating users or groups might be part of reconnaissance before an attack.\n\nThen there's a process named winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. Winlogbeat is typically used to collect Windows logs and send them somewhere else, so this could just be normal log shipping activity unless it's accessing sensitive files.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll, which I think is related to Windows Defender. That seems okay because Defender uses PowerShell for some scans or updates. But sometimes malicious scripts might load modules like that too, though in this case, it's probably benign.\n\nThere are two processes: net.exe and net1.exe being used with 'user' as an argument. These commands could be used to manage network users, which again is something a sysadmin does but could also be part of a breach if executed by unauthorized parties.\n\nLooking at the file events, there's a file named pacote_ativo.txt created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. The name seems suspicious—'pacote_ativo' translates to 'active package' in Portuguese. It might not mean anything malicious, but it's worth noting since it could be a beacon or something dropped during an attack.\n\nThere are multiple registry writes from chrome.exe. That's a bit odd because Chrome typically doesn't make many registry changes unless it's being used for some extension installations or updates. But if these changes were unexpected or in unusual locations, they could indicate tampering.\n\nOther events include processes like SDXHelper.exe and updater.exe creating pipes or loading modules. These could be legitimate activities from system utilities or third-party software, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting all this together, there are several red flags:\n- Multiple powershell.exe instances running commands that could enumerate system info.\n- Creation of a file with a suspicious name by powershell.exe.\n- Use of net.exe and net1.exe for user management, which might not be standard activity.\n- Registry modifications from an unexpected source like Chrome, though this is less clear.\n\nThe confidence level is around 0.8 because while some actions are concerning, others could be innocent. For example, if the system is being audited or maintained by IT staff, these commands make sense. However, the combination of multiple powershell.exe instances and file creation with a suspicious name does raise suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious commands, including user enumeration and file creation with a suspicious name.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's dive into analyzing this batch of log events. So, I'm given a series of JSONL entries, each representing different process creations and other system activities. My goal is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **updater.exe**: This looks like it's part of the GoogleUpdater tool, which is legitimate software used for updates. The command line includes parameters related to crash handling and URLs pointing to Google's servers, which seems normal.\n\n2. **cmdkey.exe \/list**: Command key lists cached credentials. While this can be part of legitimate system administration, in some contexts it could also be used by attackers to gather user credentials.\n\n3. **powershell.exe accessed**: PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for both administrative tasks and malicious activities. Just accessing it isn't suspicious, but the commands that follow are crucial.\n\n4. **Powershell command line**:\n   The command includes several commands: `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember -group Users`, `cmdkey.exe \/list`, checking directories with `ls` and `dir`, and querying groups. This is a bit concerning because it's retrieving user information, listing group members, accessing credentials, and exploring the file system. Such extensive use of PowerShell for these tasks could be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\n\n5. **Multiple Security Group Management events**: These are likely from the system tracking changes in security groups, but without context, it's hard to say if they're malicious. However, combined with other events, they might indicate unauthorized group modifications.\n\n6. **SDXHelper.exe loading DLLs**: This seems normal as part of Windows processes. The combase.dll and urlmon.dll are standard system files, so no immediate red flags here.\n\n7. **net.exe localgroup** and **net1.exe localgroup**: These commands retrieve or modify local group information. Again, legitimate in some contexts but could be used maliciously to add users to groups with elevated privileges.\n\n8. **Powershell creating a file**: Creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory might store configuration data. However, non-interactive profiles might not need such files, so this is worth monitoring.\n\n9. **Registry changes**: Modifying registry values using conhost.exe and SDXHelper.exe could indicate persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations, which are common in malware.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple instances of process creations, especially PowerShell with potentially malicious commands, cmdkey listing credentials, and net commands for group management. These activities collectively suggest possible unauthorized access or reconnaissance. While some events on their own might not be suspicious, the combination raises flags. For example, using cmdkey to list credentials alongside extensive PowerShell use could indicate credential harvesting. The repeated use of processes related to user and group management might be part of an attack chain aiming for privilege escalation.\n\nTherefore, considering all these activities together, the batch is likely interesting from a security standpoint as it exhibits behaviors that could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple potentially malicious activities including cmdkey.exe credential listing, extensive PowerShell use for system reconnaissance, and net commands for group management. These combined actions suggest possible unauthorized access or attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are two entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files in the same path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a known tool for collecting logs, so it's probably just setting up or updating its configuration file.\n\nNext, there's SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll from the system32 directory. URLMON.DLL is a legitimate Windows component related to URL handling and ActiveX controls. So that doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creates modulo_base.txt in the same Downloads folder. Powershell is commonly used for various tasks, both legitimate and malicious. The filename \"modulo_base.txt\" isn't immediately alarming, but it's worth keeping an eye on because PowerShell can execute code, which could be a vector for attacks.\n\nLooking further, MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe runs with some command-line arguments related to update scheduling. Edge updates are managed by this service, so that seems routine unless there's something unusual in the command line, which doesn't stand out here.\n\nThere are two events where svchost.exe sets registry values. SvcHost is a common process for running services and can do a lot of things depending on the specific service. Setting registry values could be part of normal operation or malicious activity like persistence mechanisms. Without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother event from MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is related to task scheduling in Windows. That makes sense because the process is dealing with updates and schedules.\n\nThen, backgroundTaskHost.exe loads urlmon.dll again. Background Task Host runs Windows background tasks, so this seems normal.\n\nBack to powershell.exe: one event sets a registry value, another accesses a process. This could indicate some activity, but it's not clear if it's malicious. Powershell can do many things, including legitimate scripting and administrative tasks.\n\nPutting all these together, I notice that multiple processes are accessing or modifying files and the registry, which is somewhat common in system logs. However, the powershell.exe creating a file named modulo_base.txt might be a point of interest because it's unusual for such a process to create arbitrary files, especially with a name that doesn't clearly indicate a legitimate purpose.\n\nAdditionally, the repeated activity from MicrosoftEdgeUpdate and the svchost processes setting registry values could be signs of update mechanisms or potential persistence. While these aren't necessarily malicious, they might warrant closer inspection if there's an unusual pattern or if other indicators are present.\n\nOverall, while most events look routine, the combination of powershell.exe creating a file and multiple registry modifications by different processes raises some flags. This makes the batch interesting enough to investigate further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple process activities such as file creation by powershell.exe and registry modifications, which could indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
