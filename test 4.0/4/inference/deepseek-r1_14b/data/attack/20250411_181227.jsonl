{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and persistence. The command lines in these events are creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe as the action. Using calc.exe might seem benign, but it's commonly used in malicious activities to pivot into other processes or execute additional payloads.\n\nLooking at each event, they're all similar—each one is registering a new scheduled task using different names like \"unidade_ativo\" and \"registro_geral\". The fact that multiple tasks are being created with the same structure suggests this could be part of an attempt to establish persistence. Attackers often create multiple tasks to avoid detection or ensure their malicious code runs reliably.\n\nThe events also mention that these tasks run under the BUILTIN\\Administrators group with the highest privileges. This is concerning because it means the scheduled tasks have elevated access, which can lead to more severe actions if something goes wrong or if they're part of a larger attack chain.\n\nAdditionally, there are other entries where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. These actions could be indicators of attempts to modify system configurations or establish persistence mechanisms beyond just creating scheduled tasks. The registry writes might be setting up keys that will trigger malicious activities upon system startup or certain events.\n\nI also see some events related to image loading in PowerShell, which loaded mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. These are part of the .NET framework, but their presence in unusual contexts can indicate code injection or execution of arbitrary .NET code, which is another sign of potential malicious activity.\n\nFurthermore, while there's a chrome.exe event that created a pipe and modified the registry, this isn't as concerning on its own unless it's part of a broader pattern. However, given the prevalence of PowerShell activities here, it's worth considering if this could be unrelated or just noise.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity: creating scheduled tasks with high privileges, accessing system processes, and loading .NET components. These are all behaviors consistent with a potential cyberattack aiming to gain persistence and elevate privileges.\n\nI'm confident enough that these events merit investigation because they show several red flags typically associated with malicious activities. The combination of multiple scheduled task creations, elevated permissions, and registry modifications points towards an attack vector trying to establish long-term access on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity including creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges and accessing processes, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from powershell.exe. The initial few lines show that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, which in itself isn't unusual since PowerShell often loads these components. However, later on, there's a command line argument that catches my attention: it's creating a scheduled task using New-ScheduledTaskAction and setting it to execute calc.exe at logon for Administrators with highest privileges. That seems suspicious because creating tasks with high-level access could be an indicator of malicious activity. It might be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\nThen, there are events where powershell.exe creates a temporary file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_...) and immediately deletes it. This behavior is concerning because creating and then deleting files can be a tactic to avoid detection, such as dropping malware or backdooring systems. The fact that the file is deleted right after creation might mean it's trying to hide its presence.\n\nLooking further, I see several events from chrome.exe modifying registry values multiple times. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings and extensions, repeated writes without a clear purpose could indicate tampering, especially if they're not related to normal browser operations. However, since Chrome is a common application, this might just be regular activity unless there's evidence of unauthorized changes.\n\nThere are also events labeled as \"Execute a Remote Command\" with no process or file information. These are vague but potentially dangerous. Remote command execution can lead to arbitrary code being run, which is a red flag for potential attacks like remote shell invocations or reverse shells. The lack of context makes it hard to assess the exact impact, but these events should be investigated.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe activities suggest possible malicious scripting, temporary file handling implies attempts to hide evidence, repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe are unusual, and the remote command executions are concerning. These factors combined point towards potential malicious behavior that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including powershell.exe creating a scheduled task to execute calc.exe with admin privileges, temporary file creation and deletion, repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe, and numerous 'Execute a Remote Command' events.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let's see... There are a bunch of events here, each with process info, winlog tasks, and file paths.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That seems suspicious because executing remote commands can be a sign of malicious activity, like command-line attacks or remote code execution. But then again, it could also be legitimate if an admin is running scripts remotely for management purposes.\n\nLooking closer at some specific events: there's one where powershell.exe is used with a command line that creates a scheduled task. The command looks like it's trying to execute calc.exe at logon with highest privileges. That definitely stands out because using Powershell to create scheduled tasks, especially with administrative rights, is often a tactic in cyberattacks. This could be part of persistence mechanisms where attackers set up tasks to run malicious code on each login.\n\nAnother point is the file creation events. For example, there's a file created by powershell.exe at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_principal.txt'. While creating files isn't inherently bad, the context here matters. If this file was written by malicious script, it could contain harmful code or be used as part of an attack chain.\n\nAlso, several entries show svchost.exe interacting with the registry and file system. SvcHost is a common process in Windows, but when it's modifying registry values or creating files, especially without clear justification, it might indicate something suspicious. Malware often uses svchost as a wrapper for malicious activities because it's a trusted process.\n\nThere are also some entries from chrome.exe loading DLLs and accessing the registry. While Chrome is legitimate, unusual registry accesses could be indicators of compromise if they're part of an exploit or persistence mechanism.\n\nOne event mentions \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a config file. WinlogBeat is a legitimate tool for collecting Windows logs, so that's probably benign unless it's being used in an unexpected way here.\n\nPutting this all together: the repeated remote command executions, the use of Powershell to create a scheduled task with administrative privileges, and the file creations by various processes suggest potential malicious activity. These could be signs of an attack where an adversary is trying to establish persistence or execute malicious scripts.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if these activities could be legitimate. For instance, system admins might run remote commands for maintenance, create scheduled tasks for automation, and have various services interact with the registry and file system. Without more context, it's hard to tell definitively.\n\nBut given that several events point towards potentially malicious actions—like the Powershell command creating a task that runs calc.exe at logon—I think this batch is definitely worth investigating further. The confidence level isn't super high because some activities could be benign, but there are enough red flags to merit closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events indicating potentially malicious behavior, such as remote command executions and suspicious file creations.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let me look through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where the process name is 'chrome.exe' and the task is a Registry value set. That seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings. There's nothing unusual here on its own, just regular browser activity. \n\nThen, I see an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of the system's logging setup, maybe Beats, so this is probably normal behavior as it rotates or creates log files.\n\nThe next event is powershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Creating a file isn't suspicious by itself, but I should consider the context. If this was a one-time creation without any other indicators, it might not be bad, but combined with the previous events, maybe there's something to look into.\n\nLooking at all the events together, most are standard except for the powershell.exe activity. However, without more context like additional process behavior or network traffic, it's hard to say definitively. Since only one event is from PowerShell and it's just creating a file, I'm leaning towards not being immediately suspicious, but I'm not entirely sure.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily show normal user activity with Chrome interacting with the registry and legitimate logging processes.
