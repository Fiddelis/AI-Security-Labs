{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let's see what we have here.\n\nLooking through the events, most of them are from processes like chrome.exe doing network connections and DNS queries. Those seem normal since Chrome does a lot of that activity when browsing. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe making registry changes—that might be okay too because Windows services often interact with the registry.\n\nI spot some notepad.exe accessing the registry. Not sure if that's suspicious on its own, but maybe it's part of legitimate operations. Powershell.exe shows up a couple times with process access and creating tasks. I know Powershell can be used for both good and bad things, so that could be a red flag.\n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe event where the command line includes schtasks commands to create new tasks on logon and startup. The task runs calc.exe, which is innocent by itself but combined with other things... Also, there are multiple schtasks.exe processes creating similar scheduled tasks. That seems repetitive, maybe part of a script or something malicious.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe command that creates two different tasks pointing to calc.exe. And then Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll—that's not usual because I don't think calculator needs that DLL. Plus, svchost.exe making file and registry changes multiple times—svchost is often used by malware because it's a legitimate process.\n\nPutting this together: several scheduled tasks created using schtasks from cmd.exe and Powershell, both pointing to calc.exe. The repeated use of schtasks suggests automation or an attempt to persist the calc.exe execution on startup or logon. Also, Calculator.exe accessing urlmon.dll might be trying to do something malicious like exploit it.\n\nSo overall, these activities could indicate persistence mechanisms being set up by malware, using legitimate tools (cmd, Powershell, schtasks) to create scheduled tasks that run calc.exe at system startup or user logon. That's definitely concerning because it shows signs of a possible attack aiming for persistence and potential execution of malicious code.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating the creation of scheduled tasks via schtasks.exe, including commands to execute calc.exe at system startup or user logon. Additionally, there are repeated registry modifications and file creations by svchost.exe, which could suggest malicious activity attempting persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system events to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let's look through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, multiple instances show processes like svchost.exe and cmd.exe setting registry values. That might be normal since svchost is a common Windows process, but unusual activity here could indicate something malicious. However, without more context, these alone aren't conclusive.\n\nI notice several entries from chrome.exe with registry value sets and image loads. Chrome often interacts with the registry and loads DLLs, so this isn't uncommon. But the frequency might be worth noting—there are multiple such events for chrome, which could suggest something unusual but not necessarily malicious yet.\n\nThere's a file creation event by winlogbeat.exe, which is likely part of log management software. That doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nA powershell.exe process created a file named unidade_ativo.txt. Powershell can be used for both legitimate and malicious tasks. The filename seems generic, but creating files with powershell could be part of malicious activities like dropping payloads or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: while individual events might not seem suspicious, the combination—multiple registry writes by various processes, including powershell creating a file—could indicate potential malicious activity. The volume and types of these events may warrant further investigation to ensure there's no ongoing compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of processes like svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe performing registry modifications, combined with file creation activities, suggest potential malicious behavior. The use of powershell.exe to create a file named 'unidade_ativo.txt' is particularly notable as it could be indicative of suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. Let me look through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is chrome.exe and the task is a registry value being set. That's six times in a row. I know that legitimate programs often interact with the Windows registry, so these could be normal operations by Chrome or its extensions. No immediate red flags here, but repeated writes to the registry might warrant some attention if they're unusual.\n\nThen there's an entry from powershell.exe being accessed, which is process access. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. It can execute scripts, so this could be a sign of something suspicious, especially since it's listed twice in the logs. However, without more context on what exactly was done with Powershell, it's hard to say.\n\nThe next event is whoami.exe being run from system32. Whoami is typically used to display user information and is generally not malicious, but its execution could be part of a larger sequence of actions. Since it's only once here, I'm less concerned unless there are other indicators.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple registry writes by Chrome, which might be normal; two instances where Powershell was accessed, which is concerning because of its dual use; and a single whoami.exe execution. The combination could indicate potential malicious activity, especially since Powershell is often used for attacks like script injection or lateral movement.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if these are just legitimate activities or part of an attack. Given that, the batch might be interesting enough to warrant further investigation because there's a mix of actions that could be part of a larger campaign.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and process access events for powershell.exe, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}
