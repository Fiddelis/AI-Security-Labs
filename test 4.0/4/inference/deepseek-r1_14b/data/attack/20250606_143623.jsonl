Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are a few entries where the process is 'powershell.exe' accessing something with 'ProcessAccess'. That's normal for PowerShell since it's a scripting tool and often interacts with system resources. But then I notice that PowerShell is being used to create a new service using the command line. Specifically, it's creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to a binary path. That seems suspicious because creating services can be part of malicious activity, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nAlso, there are several events where 'powershell.exe' loads various .NET framework DLLs and other system files. While that might seem normal, the fact that multiple image load events occur in quick succession could indicate that something is dynamically loading these modules, which might not be standard behavior.\n\nAnother red flag is the creation of a temporary PowerShell script file '__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1' and then immediately deleting it. This behavior is often seen in attempts to bypass certain security policies or to remove evidence after executing malicious code.\n\nAdditionally, 'services.exe' is modifying the registry multiple times. While services do interact with the registry, repeated writes without a clear purpose can be indicative of unauthorized changes, possibly setting up service entries for persistence.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show signs of potentially malicious activity involving PowerShell script execution, creation of a new service, and attempts to hide traces by deleting temporary files. The combination suggests a possible attack vector or lateral movement within the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell executions creating a service and loading various DLLs, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The user has given me 24 JSONL events, each with process, winlog, and file information.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the types of events happening here. Most of them are either \"Registry value set\" or \"Image loaded\". There's also a \"File created\" event and one where \"File creation\" is involved. \n\nLooking at the processes involved, I see several instances of 'services.exe', 'tarefa_logico.exe', 'powershell.exe', 'MsMpEng.exe', and multiple 'svchost.exe'. These are all legitimate system processes, except maybe 'tarefa_logico.exe' which sounds suspicious because it's not a commonly known process. It keeps loading .NET framework DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. That could be normal for some applications but might indicate something more if combined with other actions.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value set events by different processes, especially 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe'. These are both known to be used by malware because they can execute code as part of system services or host processes.频繁的Registry操作可能是在隐藏恶意行为或者改变系统配置。\n\nAlso, 'powershell.exe' is creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for executing malicious commands. Creating files in such directories could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere's one event where a file is created in the WindowsUpdate logs directory. That seems normal, but sometimes attackers might try to manipulate update logs to hide their tracks or plant backdoors.\n\nOverall, while each individual event might not seem suspicious on its own, the combination raises some flags. The repeated Registry writes by various processes could indicate malicious activity trying to establish persistence or alter system settings. The use of 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading .NET DLLs is also concerning as it's less common and could be part of a custom exploit or backdoor.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the patterns, especially multiple Registry writes by different processes, suggest potential malicious behavior. However, I'm not entirely certain without more context, so my confidence is around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple Registry value set events from various legitimate-looking processes, which may indicate potential malicious activity attempting to establish persistence or alter system configurations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

I see multiple entries where the process is \"svchost.exe\" and the task is \"Registry value set.\" Since svchost.exe is a common Windows process that hosts services, seeing it interact with the registry isn't unusual on its own. However, when there are several such events in a row, it might indicate some activity worth looking into.\n\nThen, I notice a shift to \"setup.exe\" creating multiple files in a specific directory related to Microsoft Edge. This could be part of a legitimate update or installation process. But the fact that these file creation tasks are happening en masse and followed by an Image Load event from setup.exe might raise some flags. Malware often uses setup.exe for dropping files, so this could be suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, there's a RuntimeBroker.exe setting registry values. While Runtime Broker is a legitimate Windows process, any unexpected registry modifications should be monitored, especially if they're happening alongside other potentially malicious activities.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the combination of multiple svchost.exe registry writes and setup.exe creating files in an Edge-related directory makes this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'svchost.exe' modifying registry values and 'setup.exe' creating files related to Microsoft Edge may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of log events. I'm seeing a lot of entries here, all in JSONL format, each line representing an event from the system logs. My goal is to determine if this entire batch should be classified as interesting or not based on potential malicious behavior.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first few lines are from processes named 'svchost.exe', which is a common Windows process that can sometimes be associated with malware because it's often used by system services but can also be exploited. The events here mention registry tasks like \"Registry value set\" and \"Registry object added or deleted.\" Registry modifications are common in malicious activities to maintain persistence or alter system configurations, so these entries could be red flags.\n\nNext, I notice some events from 'services.exe'. This is another legitimate Windows process responsible for managing services. However, if it's performing unexpected registry operations, especially multiple writes, it might indicate suspicious activity, like a service being manipulated by an attacker.\n\nThen there are entries from 'setup.exe', which is typically used during software installations. The logs show file creation events in various locations, such as creating files under Program Files and System32 directories, as well as shortcut files in the Start Menu and Quick Launch folders. While setup.exe doing its job might not be malicious, the volume of these events and their specific paths could warrant closer inspection.\n\nLooking at the file paths created by 'setup.exe', I see files like 'msedge_proxy.exe' and 'pwahelper.exe'. These names are somewhat generic but could potentially be related to legitimate software updates or new installations. However, if Microsoft Edge isn't being updated or installed around this time, these might seem out of place.\n\nAnother point is the creation of .lnk files in user directories like Quick Launch and Start Menu. Malware often creates shortcuts for persistence or to launch malicious processes at startup. The presence of multiple such lnk files created by setup.exe could indicate an attempt to modify the system's behavior upon boot or user login.\n\nI'm also noting that there are no file events for most entries, which is a bit concerning because in many cases, especially when dealing with malicious activities, you'd expect some file operations beyond just registry changes. However, the combination of multiple registry writes and file creations could still be problematic.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: multiple processes (svchost.exe, services.exe, setup.exe) performing registry modifications and creating files in potentially sensitive locations, along with the creation of shortcut files which are often used maliciously for persistence. This pattern doesn't align with normal system behavior during typical operations or software installations. It raises concerns about possible unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while some of these actions could be part of legitimate processes, the frequency and combination make it unlikely to be benign. Especially the registry modifications by svchost.exe and services.exe, which are more commonly associated with malicious behavior when seen in such a volume.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events by 'svchost.exe' and 'services.exe', along with file creation activities by 'setup.exe', suggest potential malicious or unauthorized system modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let me try to understand each event and see if there's anything that stands out as suspicious.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them involve processes like setup.exe making changes to the registry or creating pipes. There are a lot of entries where setup.exe is setting registry values and creating pipes. I know that legitimate software installations might do this, but seeing so many similar events from the same process could be a red flag if it's part of an attack.\n\nThen there are some events from RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe. Svchost.exe is known to be part of Windows services, so it's common to see its activity. However, the files created by svchost.exe in the Windows Temp directory look like temporary appx files. These might be related to updates or package installations. But seeing multiple such files could indicate something malicious trying to hide its components.\n\nI should also consider whether these activities are normal for a system. For instance, setup.exe modifying registry values and creating pipes is typical during software setups, but if this happens frequently without any corresponding installation activity, it might be suspicious. The fact that there are so many such events across multiple lines makes me think something isn't right.\n\nAdditionally, the temp files created by svchost.exe have unusual names with random-looking suffixes. This could be an attempt to create temporary files that blend in but aren't easily identifiable. Malware often uses such techniques to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events might be legitimate, the volume and specific actions—especially from setup.exe and the temp files created by svchost.exe—raise concerns about potential malicious activity. It's probably worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creations by 'setup.exe' and 'svchost.exe', including temporary files with unusual names, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see multiple events where svchost.exe is creating files in the Windows AppReadiness folder. SvChost.exe is a common system process, so seeing it create files isn't unusual on its own. However, the fact that these are repeated four times might raise an eyebrow because svchost typically doesn't create many files like this unless something is wrong.\n\nThen there are several registry value sets by svchost.exe as well. While svchost can modify the registry, multiple such events in a row could be suspicious. Maybe it's trying to change some system settings repeatedly, which might indicate malicious activity.\n\nNext, there's an event involving powershell.exe being executed with a command that just writes \"Final result: 1\" to the host. That seems a bit odd because why run PowerShell for such a simple task? It could be part of legitimate scripting, but it's worth noting. Also, the subsequent image load events from various .NET and system DLLs are standard when running scripts in PowerShell.\n\nPutting this together, while individual events might not look bad, the combination—multiple file creations by svchost.exe and a suspicious PowerShell command—could indicate malicious behavior or at least something worth investigating. I'm not entirely sure if it's an attack, but there are enough red flags to consider this batch interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by svchost.exe in the AppReadiness folder and a PowerShell command execution with restricted policies could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events, all related to PowerShell and some other processes. Let's see... There are multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with different command lines. The first few events show ImageLoad tasks for MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which seems normal because those are legitimate files.\n\nThen I notice a whoami.exe process being created, which is usually used to check user permissions or privileges. That in itself isn't suspicious, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it might be worth looking into.\n\nLooking further, there's a Process Create event for powershell.exe with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. That stands out because scripts typically run under a default execution policy, and changing it might indicate some script execution is happening. The command line in that process looks like it's trying to check for specific .inf files in the Windows directory. If these .inf files are related to driver installations or system configurations, this could be part of legitimate operations, but it's also a common tactic for attackers to look for certain files as part of reconnaissance.\n\nAnother thing I see is multiple FileCreate events from PowerShell creating temporary files in C:\\Windows\\Temp and elsewhere. Temporary files can be normal, especially if scripts are being run, but again, the combination with other activities might raise flags.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, which could be for inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to say. I'm thinking that PowerShell often creates pipes for its operations, so this alone isn't concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows repeated use of PowerShell with specific command-line arguments and file manipulations. The script execution under a restricted policy might be trying to avoid detection or run arbitrary commands. The checking of .inf files could be part of enumerating system information or looking for vulnerabilities. The creation of temporary script files (.psm1) is particularly interesting because scripts can execute code, and having multiple such files created in quick succession might indicate some automated or malicious process.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the activities don't seem entirely normal, especially the combination of restricted execution policy, file creation, and specific file accesses. However, I need to assess how likely these actions are part of a legitimate process versus potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with varying command lines, including script execution under restricted policies and temporary file creation, along with whoami.exe usage, suggest potential malicious activity or atypical system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

This seems suspicious because disabling defender can be a way attackers try to lower system security.\n\nLooking further, I see several events where Dism.exe is creating files in a temporary folder. The paths look unusual and the repeated creation of DLLs might indicate something malicious, like loading components for a payload.\n\nThe frequency of these activities is another red flag. Multiple instances of file creations and executables detected from the same process could suggest an ongoing malicious operation, possibly setting up or distributing malware.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it's likely that this batch of logs indicates potential malicious behavior aimed at compromising system security by disabling defender and deploying malicious files.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of processes (cmd.exe, Dism.exe) executing commands to disable or remove Windows Defender features, combined with the creation of temporary files and DLLs.

It's common for system processes to access temporary files during operations.\n\nEach log entry has the same process name and task, just different file paths. These seem to be related to localization resources (en-US) which Dism.exe might need when performing its tasks. The pattern is consistent across all events, suggesting normal operation rather than malicious activity.\n\nSince all events are from the same source and don't indicate any unusual behavior like multiple failed attempts or access to unexpected locations, there's no red flag here.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, the user has given me a batch of events in JSONL format. Each line is an event with three keys: process, winlog, and file. \n\nFirst, I notice that all these events are coming from Dism.exe, which stands for Deployment Image Service Installer. That's part of Windows and is usually used for installing or updating system images. It's a legitimate tool, so at first glance, it might not seem suspicious.\n\nLooking at the winlog entries, each one says \"File Executable Detected\" with the rule FileExecutableDetected. This sounds like something that could be triggered when an executable file is accessed or opened. So, Dism.exe is detecting these files. But are these normal operations?\n\nThe paths in the 'file' key all point to various DLLs located in a temporary folder under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. The filenames include things like SmiProvider.dll.mui and FolderProvider.dll. These names seem related to system providers or components, which Dism.exe would typically interact with during image servicing operations.\n\nConsidering that Dism.exe is used for legitimate system updates or installations, processing multiple DLL files in a temporary directory might be part of its standard operation. It's possible that these events are normal and not indicative of malicious activity.\n\nI should also consider whether the frequency of these events is unusual. There are 14 events here, each involving different provider DLLs. If Dism.exe is running as part of an update or deployment process, it might be expected to handle several files at once. However, without knowing the baseline of normal activities for this system, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nAnother angle is whether these DLLs are signed by Microsoft or trusted vendors. Since they're in a temporary directory and named after standard providers, they likely are legitimate parts of the Windows update process. Malicious actors would probably use more generic or less predictable filenames.\n\nAlso, the fact that all events come from Dism.exe and involve standard operations related to system images makes me lean towards this being normal behavior rather than an attack. There's no indication here of any unauthorized access or unusual activities like privilege escalation or network communication.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to be cautious, especially in cybersecurity, the information provided doesn't suggest malicious intent.

This is a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing and updating operating systems.\n\n2. **Understand the Event Type:**\n   - Each event triggers \"File Executable Detected\" via the rule `FileExecutableDetected`. This typically indicates that an executable file was accessed or opened by a process.\n\n3. **Examine the File Paths:**\n   - The files are located in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`) and include various `.dll` files, such as `SmiProvider.dll.mui`, `FolderProvider.dll`, etc.\n   - These files appear to be system-related providers or components, which Dism.exe would interact with during image servicing operations.\n\n4. **Assess the Context:**\n   - Since `Dism.exe` is a legitimate tool, it's expected to process multiple files, especially during updates or installations of Windows components.\n   - The consistent naming convention and file types suggest they are part of standard system operations rather than malicious payloads.\n\n5. **Consider Frequency and Baseline:**\n   - While the exact number of events isn't provided as a baseline, 14 events processing various provider DLLs could be within normal bounds for Dism.exe during certain operations.\n\n6. **Evaluate Potential Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No indicators of malicious activity (e.g., unexpected file origins, irregular patterns) are present.\n   - The files are named after standard system components, which is typical for legitimate processes.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the information provided, it's unlikely these events indicate malicious activity.

Hmm, Dism.exe sounds familiar—it's related to Windows Deployment Services, right? So normally, when you're installing or updating Windows, Dism might be running and cleaning up temp files. \n\nLooking at all these events together, it seems like Dism.exe is systematically deleting various DLLs and their MUI (Multilingual User Interface) files from a specific temporary folder. The path looks unique each time, but they're all under the same user's AppData Local Temp directory. \n\nI wonder if this is part of a legitimate Windows update or deployment process.

From what I know, Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing and deployment operations. It handles tasks like installing updates and managing image-based deployments. So, Dism.exe performing deletions isn't inherently suspicious on its own.\n\nThe files being deleted are .mui files, which are resource files containing localized strings.

So each event is a notification that a file was deleted by Dism.exe.\n\nLooking at the 'file' path, every entry points to different DLL files in the same temporary directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\... followed by various provider names like FfuProvider.dll, FolderProvider.dll, etc. The naming suggests these are related to Windows servicing or setup components.\n\nSince all events involve Dism.exe deleting multiple DLLs from a temp folder, I'm thinking this is part of a normal system operation. Dism often works with temporary files during updates or when applying images. So each deletion might be part of cleaning up after some deployment task.\n\nI don't see any anomalies here—no unexpected file paths, no signs of unusual access times, and all deletions are accounted for by the same process. If Dism.exe is a legitimate process on this system, especially if it's running during an update or configuration change, then these events are standard.\n\nTherefore, there’s nothing malicious or suspicious in this batch. It seems like routine file management by a valid Windows tool.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Dism.exe deleting files from the same temporary directory, which is likely part of normal system operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this log data that the user provided. It seems to be a sequence of events from some system logs, possibly Windows Event Logs or similar. Each entry has three parts: process information, winlog (which I assume is Windows Log), and file information.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that many entries have \"None\" for one or more fields. For example, the first few entries have process info but no file path, or vice versa. This might indicate that those fields weren't captured or are not applicable for that particular event.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a variety of system-related executables like services.exe, sppsvc.exe, and svchost.exe. These are common system processes, so their presence in logs isn't necessarily suspicious on their own. However, I should note any unusual behavior associated with them.\n\nOne entry stands out: several entries have the same command line involving powershell.exe creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to a path with backslashes and some Brazilian Portuguese terms like \"unidade_logico\", which translates to \"logical unit\". The path structure seems a bit off, with multiple levels like \"registro_comum\\entrada_base\". I wonder if that's a standard directory structure or if it's something created by the script. Also, using powershell.exe to create services could be legitimate administrative activity, but it might also be a red flag depending on the context.\n\nThe tasks in winlog vary from 'Process Create' to 'Registry value set', 'Image loaded', and others like 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. Some of these are generic events that occur regularly during system operations. However, terms like \"Windows Update Agent\" might indicate legitimate system updates, but they could also be part of a larger pattern if seen in conjunction with other activities.\n\nI'm also noticing timestamps aren't provided, which makes it harder to assess the timeline and frequency of these events. If multiple suspicious processes or task executions occur within a short period, that could raise concerns about malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is the consistency in the powershell.exe command across several entries. Repeated attempts to create or start services with the same parameters might be an attempt at persistence or ensuring a service runs after reboots, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThe file paths mentioned, like \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\", are specific and don't seem to align with standard Windows directories. This could mean that the script is placing files in non-standard locations, which might be an attempt to hide or avoid detection.\n\nI should also consider if these events correlate with any known vulnerabilities or attack vectors. For instance, creating services via powershell can be used for persistence, and unusual file paths might indicate dropped malicious binaries.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to definitively say whether this is malicious activity or just legitimate system administration. It could also be part of a larger script or update process that the user or an application is running.\n\nIf I were investigating this, I'd start by checking if \"objeto_ativo\" service exists in the system and what its actual binary path points to. Verifying whether these processes are running legitimately and if there's any network activity associated with them would be important steps. Additionally, looking into the source of the powershell commands—whether they're coming from a legitimate script or an external source—would help determine their nature.\n\nIn summary, while the activities don't conclusively prove malicious intent, several red flags like non-standard file paths, repeated powershell service creation, and potentially suspicious process names suggest that further investigation is warranted. It would be prudent to review these events in the context of broader system behavior and with the help of additional logs or security tools.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log data you've shared appears to contain a series of events from a system, possibly Windows-based, involving processes, tasks, and file operations. Here's an analysis and summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Processes and Tasks:**\n   - The logs show various processes being created or interacting with system components, such as `services.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and others.\n   - There are tasks related to process creation, registry events, image loading, and provider lifecycle events.\n\n2. **Powershell Activity:**\n   - Multiple entries show the same Powershell command being executed:\n     ```powershell\n     & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\" Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n     ```\n   - This command creates a new service named `objeto_ativo` and starts it. The binary path points to a file in a non-standard directory (`C:\\\\unidade_logico...`).\n\n3. **File Operations:**\n   - Some entries mention files, such as `taskschd.exe` (related to Task Scheduler) or specific paths like `C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe`.\n\n4. **Suspicious Observations:**\n   - The repeated use of Powershell to create and start a service could indicate potential malicious activity.\n   - The path `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base` is unusual and not a standard Windows directory.\n\n5. **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - Creation of a new service with potentially malicious intent.\n   - Use of Powershell, which is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities.\n   - Non-standard file paths that might indicate dropped malware or unauthorized files.\n\n6. **Recommendations:**\n   - Investigate the `objeto_ativo` service to determine if it's legitimate or malicious.\n   - Review the origin of the Powershell command and whether it was triggered by user action or automated processes.\n   - Check for any unusual network activity or file changes associated with these events.\n\nIf you're concerned about potential unauthorized access or malware, consider conducting a thorough security audit, using endpoint detection tools, and reviewing recent system updates or configurations."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm supposed to determine if the entire set is interesting or not for investigation. \n\nFirst, I see that all these events are related to PowerShell command executions on Windows systems. There are multiple entries here, each showing different command lines.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's executing a PowerShell script that creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and starts it. That seems suspicious because creating services is a common tactic in malware to maintain persistence. The path in the binary path name \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum...\" looks like it might be obfuscated or using some encoding, which could indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nThen, there are several events where PowerShell is being run with \"-ExecutionPolicy Restricted\" and commands that output \"Final result: 1\". The restricted execution policy usually limits script execution, but if the command itself isn't doing much besides writing to the host, it might not be immediately suspicious. However, the fact that this is repeated multiple times could indicate testing or probing behavior.\n\nThe later events have more complex PowerShell commands. They're checking for specific patterns in .inf files located in the Windows directory. The regex pattern looks like it's searching for sections related to default installations for different architectures (amd64, arm, etc.). This kind of activity might be part of a reconnaissance script trying to gather system information or looking for vulnerabilities.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a mix of potentially malicious activities: creating services, repeated commands that could be testing boundaries, and scripts scanning system files. The repetition suggests automated behavior, which is often seen in attack campaigns. While some commands might appear benign on their own, the combination raises red flags about possible unauthorized access or malicious intent.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because of the indicators of potential malicious activity, like service creation and system file scanning. The confidence isn't super high because some parts could be legitimate scripts, but the overall pattern is concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell command executions with potentially malicious activities such as creating a service and scanning system files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events provided. Each event is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nFirst, the first two events are identical. They both have a command line that runs powershell.exe with an execution policy set to Restricted. The command they're executing seems to be checking for specific .inf files in the Windows directory. The script reads each .inf file and looks for a particular pattern related to defaultinstall.nt followed by different architectures like amd64 or x86. If it finds that pattern, it sets a result variable to 1 and breaks out of the loop. Then it writes the result.\n\nSo, running powershell with an execution policy set to Restricted is somewhat unusual because typically you'd use RemoteSigned or AllSigned for security in enterprise environments. But it's not necessarily malicious on its own—it could be legitimate administrative work. The script itself seems to be scanning system files, which is a common behavior for both legitimate scripts and potential attackers trying to gather information about the system.\n\nLooking at the next event: process is None, winlog task is 'Security Group Management'. That might indicate some group policy-related activity or permission changes, which could be normal but also potentially suspicious if it's outside regular business hours or not expected.\n\nThe fourth event shows a process named services.exe. Services.exe is part of Windows and handles service-related tasks, so this seems normal unless there are deviations in how it's being executed.\n\nThen there's another event with no process, a task of 'Special Logon', which could be related to system logon events or background processes.\n\nSo, considering all these events together, the first two powershell executions stand out. The script is checking for specific .inf files that might be linked to driver installations or Windows updates. Malicious actors often look for such files to gather information about the system's architecture, which could be a precursor to deploying targeted malware. \n\nThe use of powershell with ExecutionPolicy Restricted is a bit concerning because it's not commonly used in that way—it might be an attempt to execute arbitrary commands while limiting script execution elsewhere, or perhaps to bypass certain security measures.\n\nHowever, without more context, like the user account running these scripts or the exact timing and frequency of these events, it's hard to say definitively. The combination of checking specific .inf files with a powershell command that has restricted execution could indicate reconnaissance activity, which would make the batch interesting for further investigation. \n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because of the potential malicious intent in the script execution and the nature of the tasks involved. My confidence is about 0.7 because while the indicators are concerning, there's no clear evidence of outright malicious behavior yet.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events with powershell.exe executing a command that checks for specific .inf files in the Windows directory. This could indicate potential system reconnaissance or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
