{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few entries are about processes accessing or creating. Notably, there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Powershell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious purposes. The command lines here don't immediately raise red flags, but repeated use might indicate something suspicious.\n\nLooking deeper, I see several instances where Registry values are being set by various processes like services.exe, sc.exe, and others. This kind of activity could be part of normal system operations, but it's also a common tactic for malware to maintain persistence. The fact that multiple different processes are interacting with the registry might be a sign of something more.\n\nThere are entries where cmd.exe is used to execute commands like creating services or starting scripts. For example, \"sc create\" and \"sc qc\" suggest service creation and querying, which could be legitimate admin tasks, but without context, it's hard to say. The script paths mentioned in the command lines don't exist (e.g., NonExistingScript.ps1), which is a red flag because they shouldn't be accessing files that don't exist.\n\nAlso, there are entries where processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and Calculator.exe load urlmon.dll, which is part of Windows but can sometimes be associated with malicious activities. However, this could also be normal behavior, so I need to consider that.\n\nAnother point is the repeated ProcessAccess tasks for powershell.exe. While it's a common tool, multiple accesses without obvious reason might indicate suspicious activity.\n\nIn summary, while some events could be part of legitimate system operations, the combination of registry manipulation, non-existent script paths, and repeated powershell usage makes this batch potentially interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creations, registry modifications, and attempts to execute non-existing scripts suggest potential malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nThe first event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal since it's likely part of the log shipping process.\n\nNext, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe are all setting registry values. These could be legitimate activities. Powershell is commonly used for scripting, so its actions need to be in context.\n\nThere are multiple events where chrome.exe creates pipes and sets registry values. Chrome often interacts with the system in various ways, especially when extending functionality or accessing certain features.\n\nAnother point of interest: several instances where powershell.exe accesses processes. I should check if these accesses are part of normal operations or if they're reaching into other processes suspiciously.\n\nLooking at the image load events from chrome.exe, they're loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are standard Windows Defender components. This seems routine.\n\nOverall, most events appear to be normal system activity without any clear signs of malicious behavior. There's no indication of unusual file accesses or known malicious process interactions. The repeated actions by chrome.exe fit expected behaviors for a browser.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as file creation, registry value changes, and loading standard system files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
