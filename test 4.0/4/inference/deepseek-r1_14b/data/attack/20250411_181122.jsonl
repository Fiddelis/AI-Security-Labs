{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm new to analyzing logs, but I'll give it my best shot.\n\nLooking at the events, they all seem related to PowerShell being executed on a system. The first event shows \"whoami.exe\" running, which is usually harmless—it just tells you who's logged in. But then there are multiple entries where PowerShell is involved.\n\nI notice that several events have command lines with commands like `findstr` and `select-string`, searching for the word \"pass\" in various file types. That makes me think someone might be trying to find password information. Searching for keywords related to passwords could indicate data theft or unauthorized access.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances where PowerShell creates a temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1`) and then deletes it. This behavior is a bit concerning because deleting files after accessing them can be an attempt to cover tracks—like evidence destruction during malicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks without much context, but combined with the other events, they could be part of a larger malicious process. The loading of various DLLs by PowerShell might be normal, but when combined with the suspicious command-line arguments and file operations, it raises red flags.\n\nThe confidence here isn't 100% because while these actions are unusual, there's no direct evidence of harm yet—just indicators that could point to malicious intent. So I'd classify this as INTERESTING due to the potential signs of data exfiltration or persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious command-line arguments and file operations, including search for 'pass' in sensitive files and creation\/deletion of temporary script files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. The user is a cybersecurity expert and wants only one classification for the entire batch.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. There are multiple entries from powershell.exe with command lines that include searching for patterns like \"pass\" in various file types. This could be suspicious as it might indicate data theft or malicious activity.\n2. Some events show processes creating files, like winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file. That doesn't seem immediately suspicious unless the file content is malicious.\n3. There are several instances of Registry value sets from different processes, including svchost.exe and Calculator.exe. Registry modifications can be part of malware persistence mechanisms, which is concerning.\n4. Processes like findstr.exe and OfficeClickToRun.exe performing actions that might not be out of the ordinary but could also be part of malicious scripts.\n5. The repeated occurrence of powershell.exe with specific command lines suggests possible scripting or automation, which is often used in attacks.\n\nConsidering all these together, there are multiple red flags like unusual PowerShell commands, registry modifications, and repeated process creations that might indicate malicious activity. So the batch seems relevant for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including repeated powershell.exe command line executions with potential data theft patterns, file creation events, and registry modifications which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening here.\n\nFirst, most of the events are from chrome.exe doing various tasks like setting registry values, making DNS queries, loading images, and establishing network connections. These seem pretty standard for a browser process. For example, when you browse the web, Chrome would interact with the registry to store settings, query DNS to resolve domain names, load DLLs for functionality, and connect to networks as part of normal operation.\n\nThen there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is likely a log shipping tool, so it making a configuration file makes sense. That doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nNext, I see two instances where powershell.exe creates a file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. PowerShell being used to create files isn't inherently suspicious, but the filename might be significant. Without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious or part of legitimate script execution.\n\nThe last event has process as None, which is odd because every event should have a process unless there was an error in logging. The task is a DNS query, so maybe it's from another process that didn't log correctly.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, most events are normal for Chrome and system tools. The only points of interest are the PowerShell file creation and the None process event. However, these don't provide enough evidence on their own to suggest malicious activity. They could be part of legitimate operations or misconfigurations rather than attacks.\n\nSo, considering that the majority of activities are benign and there's not enough data pointing towards something suspicious, I would classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of normal browser activity (Chrome) such as registry modifications, DNS queries, image loading, and network connections. While there are some anomalies like file creation by PowerShell and a missing process in one event, these do not indicate malicious behavior without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where `powershell.exe` is involved. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so any unusual activity here could be a red flag. There are instances where PowerShell accesses processes and modifies the registry. Specifically, events like \"Registry value set\" might indicate attempts to hide or modify system configurations.\n\nI notice several command lines that look suspicious. For example, `cmd.exe` is used with commands like `schtasks \/delete`, which deletes scheduled tasks. This could be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activities or disable security-related tasks. The use of `schtasks.exe` itself is flagged multiple times, and the deletion of specific task names might be part of a larger cleanup operation.\n\nThere's also activity from `whoami.exe`, which usually retrieves user information. While it's not inherently malicious, its presence alongside other suspicious actions could suggest an attacker trying to gather system details or elevate privileges.\n\nThe events involving `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file creation by `winlogbeat.exe` seem routine, possibly part of log management. However, the combination with other activities makes me cautious.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: repeated deletions using `schtasks`, registry modifications, and process accesses via PowerShell suggest potential malicious behavior. These actions could be part of a script aimed at persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nWhile some events might look normal on their own, the sequence and variety point towards coordinated efforts that warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell process accesses, registry modifications, deletion of scheduled tasks, and command line activities which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple processes being created or accessed, especially cmd.exe, powershell.exe, WMIC.exe, whoami.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe. These tools are commonly used for legitimate system administration tasks but can also be indicators of malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the command lines:\n- cmd.exe is used with \"\/c\" to execute commands like deleting notepad.exe processes or user accounts (e.g., \"net user \/del\"). This could indicate an attempt to remove traces or disable accounts.\n- WMIC.exe is used to delete processes by name, which might be part of process termination techniques to hide malware activity.\n- powershell.exe accesses and modifies registry values without a clear benign reason. Powershell is often misused for script execution and persistence mechanisms.\n- whoami.exe is typically harmless on its own, but repeated use could signal credential dumping or user enumeration.\n- net.exe and net1.exe are used to delete users, which might be part of privilege escalation or lateral movement tactics.\n\nThe events show a pattern of process creation, registry modifications, and file deletions, all of which are common in attack chains. The combination suggests potential malicious activity rather than normal operations.\n\nI'm also considering if these activities could be from legitimate scripts or system tools, but the variety and specific commands point more towards an attack. There's no evidence of any files being accessed except for dlls, which WMIC might load normally, so that's less concerning.\n\nOverall, the sequence and types of events are indicative of potential malicious behavior, warranting further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple process creations and deletions involving cmd.exe, powershell.exe, WMIC.exe, and others, which could indicate malicious activity such as process termination or user deletion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of events here, each with process information, Windows log task details, and file info.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed. That's something to note because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But on its own, seeing it might not always mean bad stuff.\n\nThen there are several instances of user account management and security group changes. These could indicate someone managing permissions or accounts, which in some contexts might be normal admin work, but if done by the wrong person, it could be a sign of privilege escalation.\n\nI notice commands like 'net.exe' being used to delete users from the domain. That's a red flag because deleting user accounts can be part of an attacker's cleanup process after compromising accounts. The command lines show deletions using \/del and \/domain, which suggests they're trying to remove user accounts across the network.\n\nThere are also processes like 'cmd.exe' running commands that delete services, such as 'sc delete win32times'. Deleting services might be part of an attacker's strategy to disrupt normal operations or remove their own traces after doing something malicious. This could be covering up their tracks.\n\nAnother thing is the use of various executables like conhost.exe and cmd.exe accessing the registry multiple times. Registry modifications can be concerning because attackers often change system configurations there to maintain persistence or hide their activities.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, if these events are happening in a short period, it could indicate a coordinated attack where an attacker is trying to clean up after themselves or escalate privileges quickly.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a pattern of process creations (like cmd.exe and net.exe), registry modifications, user deletions, and service removals. These actions don't look like everyday normal activity. They seem too targeted and could be part of an attack chain—maybe someone trying to remove evidence or take control over the system.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because multiple red flags are present, suggesting potential malicious behavior. The confidence is high, maybe around 0.85, since there's a clear pattern but not enough direct indicators of a confirmed breach.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple process creations and registry modifications, including attempts to delete user accounts and services, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries involving PowerShell and cmd.exe. That immediately raises my curiosity because these tools are commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. So the volume here is a red flag.\n\nLooking at the specific events:\n\n1. There are multiple instances where PowerShell is being accessed or created. For example, several events show 'Process Create' for powershell.exe. This could be normal admin activity, but it's also a common tactic for attackers to use PowerShell for scripting and lateral movement.\n   \n2. The command lines sometimes look suspicious. Like the cmd.exe deleting files in the Temp directory. Deleting files can be part of cleaning up after malicious activities, so that's concerning.\n\n3. There are events where processes access the registry and set values. Registry modifications can be legitimate, but they're also used by malware to persistence or modify system configurations.\n\n4. The repeated use of 'powershell.exe & {}' in command lines stands out. This might indicate some automated script execution or perhaps an attempt to hide malicious commands within a PowerShell session.\n\n5. There are multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, which could mean it's loading various DLLs. While normal, this level of activity might suggest something more nefarious is happening.\n\nPutting all these together, the repeated use of PowerShell and cmd.exe, combined with file deletions in Temp directories and registry modifications, suggests possible malicious behavior. The volume of these activities over a short period makes me think it's not just regular system administration.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell and cmd.exe activities, including process creations, registry modifications, file deletions, and suspicious command lines indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so any unusual activity here could be suspicious. The first few events show ImageLoad tasks loading various DLLs like mscorlib.ni.dll and clrjit.dll. These are legitimate .NET framework components, so that might not be too concerning on its own.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created in the user's Temp directory with a PowerShell script test name: __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. The fact that it's created and then immediately deleted could indicate an attempt to avoid detection, which raises flags. Attackers often delete their traces quickly.\n\nNext, there are several Pipe Created events from powershell.exe. This is a bit concerning because PowerShell pipes can be used for communication between processes, potentially for malicious activities like command-and-control or lateral movement within a network.\n\nLooking further, some events show process accesses and registry value sets. The whoami.exe executions might just be checking the user's permissions, but when combined with powershell.exe activity, it could signal an attempt to escalate privileges or gather information about the system.\n\nThere are also legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe creating files, which is expected from log management tools. However, these shouldn't overshadow the concerning signs from the PowerShell activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with file creation\/deletion, pipe creations, and registry modifications suggests potential malicious behavior. The batch shows a pattern that could be part of an attack chain, such as initial access, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. While not conclusive, these indicators are significant enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes show file creation\/deletion patterns and pipe creations, which could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n1. whoami.exe is being executed. That seems normal as it's a standard tool to check user information.\n2. powershell.exe accessed. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. But without more context, I'm not sure yet.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe appears multiple times with the task \"ProcessAccess\". That might indicate repeated attempts to access it or maybe just normal usage. However, in some cases, attackers use PowerShell to execute scripts, which could be malicious.\n\nNext, there's RuntimeBroker.exe accessing the registry. Not sure if that's suspicious on its own; many legitimate processes interact with the registry.\n\nNotepad.exe also accesses the registry. Again, not inherently bad, but I should keep an eye out for any unusual registry modifications.\n\nThere are a couple of events where calc.exe and Calculator.exe load urlmon.dll. That seems odd because I don't recall Calculator needing to load that DLL. Maybe it's part of legitimate functionality, but it could also be a red flag if this behavior is unexpected.\n\nSVCHOST.exe accessing the registry multiple times. SVCHOST is often used by system services, so some registry activity isn't unusual. However, frequent modifications might warrant closer look.\n\nThere's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its data directory. That seems normal if it's part of log shipping or data collection processes.\n\nMultiple Chrome events: DNS queries and network connections. This is typical for a web browser, especially if the user is browsing multiple sites. Unless the domains are known malicious ones, this might not be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are several points that could individually raise eyebrows (like multiple PowerShell accesses), they don't collectively indicate malicious activity when viewed as a whole batch. The events seem to cover normal system processes and legitimate user activities, such as using tools like whoami.exe, accessing files with notepad, and web browsing.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear pattern of malicious behavior. However, I'll give it a confidence level of 0.7 because while nothing definitive stands out, the repeated use of PowerShell and unusual DLL loadings could be worth monitoring in a different context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as process creations, registry accesses, and legitimate file operations without evidence of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
