{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser that makes such connections regularly. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nThen I notice several entries for powershell.exe. PowerShell can be used maliciously, so this catches my attention. The first event shows a registry value being set, which could indicate some configuration changes. Next, there's a process creation with a command line argument that looks like it's starting another process to run a .bat file. That seems unusual because scripts can execute various commands.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events for different DLL files as powershell.exe runs. While this is normal for script execution, the specific paths and the number of loaded images could be red flags if they're not expected in typical operations.\n\nThen, a file creation event for a .ps1 script, followed immediately by a deletion. This might be an attempt to avoid detection by creating a temporary script and then deleting it after use. That's concerning because it's a common tactic in malware or attacks to cover their tracks.\n\nThere are also Pipe Created events, which could allow communication between processes. Malware often uses such techniques for command and control or to spread across systems.\n\nAdditionally, there are Provider Lifecycle events with command lines that again invoke powershell.exe to start .bat files. The paths in these command lines seem a bit convoluted, possibly trying to hide the true source of the script execution.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with suspicious command lines, file creation and deletion, and unusual process activity suggests potential malicious behavior. While not conclusive on their own, the combination raises enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe events including registry modifications, script execution attempts, and file deletions indicate possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that start other processes. For example, \"powershell.exe & {Start-Process...}\" which suggests that PowerShell is spawning new processes to run .bat scripts. The paths in these commands point to various scripts like entrada_base_script.bat and modulo_principal_script.bat. This could be a red flag because executing multiple scripts might indicate malicious activity, such as dropping files or running payloads.\n\nNext, there are events where the task is 'Registry value set'. Both Calculator.exe, Chrome.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe have these tasks. Modifying registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware to ensure they start on boot or alter system configurations.\n\nLooking at the processes, I see multiple instances of PowerShell being accessed or having images loaded. For example, MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll are being loaded by PowerShell. This might indicate that malicious scripts are using legitimate functions from these DLLs, which could be part of an evasion technique.\n\nThere's also a file creation event by powershell.exe in the StartupProfileData directory. Creating files in user directories can be a sign of persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple 'Registry value set' tasks attributed to Chrome.exe, which is unusual because Chrome typically doesn't make such changes unless it's being exploited. This could suggest that an attacker is using browser processes as part of their activities.\n\nThe events show a mix of legitimate system processes and potentially suspicious activities involving script execution and registry modifications. The repeated use of PowerShell with different scripts and the alteration of system files and registry entries raise concerns about potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show PowerShell executing scripts, modifying the registry, and loading modules, which could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is cmd.exe setting a registry value. That's common for scripts or manual changes, but alone it's not suspicious. Next, conhost.exe doing the same—conhost is usually legitimate, so that's probably fine.\n\nThen there are several chrome.exe events where it's either setting registry values or loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These seem normal because Chrome often interacts with system components. The multiple RegistryEvent tasks from Chrome might just be updates or configurations.\n\nLooking at svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization folder—that sounds legitimate since svchost is part of Windows services, and that path is standard for update-related files.\n\nPowershell.exe creating two files: componente_principal.txt and elemento_base.txt. Powershell can be used maliciously, but just creating files isn't enough to raise flags unless they contain suspicious content or commands. The file paths here don't seem immediately suspicious.\n\nAnother winlogbeat.exe event creating a config file—this is likely from the ELK stack tool, which is common for log management and shouldn't be alarming on its own.\n\nOverall, each individual event doesn't point to malicious activity. They mostly involve standard operations by legitimate processes. The repetition of registry changes by Chrome might indicate updates or tracking but isn't unusual. Without signs like process injection, unexpected file execution, or known malicious file hashes, the batch seems within normal bounds.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard system processes performing common operations such as registry modifications and loading legitimate system files.
