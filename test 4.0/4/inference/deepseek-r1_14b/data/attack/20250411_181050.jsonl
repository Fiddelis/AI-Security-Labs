{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system logs to determine if it's interesting for investigation. I'm going to look at each event and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, the events are spread across various processes like chrome.exe, whoami.exe, powershell.exe, winlogbeat.exe, cmd.exe, certutil.exe, rundll32.exe, and SDXHelper.exe. Notably, some of these, like powershell.exe and cmd.exe, are commonly used for scripting and can be indicative of malicious activity when used inappropriately.\n\nLooking at the tasks performed:\n- There's a DNS query from chrome.exe, which is normal for browsing.\n- whoami.exe is run without any suspicious flags, so that might not be concerning on its own.\n- Powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. This could be part of legitimate administration but also often used in attacks for persistence or privilege escalation.\n- cmd.exe runs a command involving certutil to encode files into .txt and then decode them back. Certutil is known to be abused for exfiltration or encoding malicious payloads, which raises red flags.\n- There are multiple instances where certutil.exe creates new files in the Temp directory, such as \"modulo_logico_calc_decoded.exe\" and \"estrutura_base_calc_decoded.exe.\" These filenames suggest they might be trying to hide an executable by appending .txt extensions initially.\n- Registry values being set频繁ly across processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, rundll32.exe, and SDXHelper.exe. Setting registry entries is a common tactic for attackers to maintain persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nThe use of rundll32.exe with PcaSvc.dll might be legitimate, but it's worth checking if this specific task is standard on the system. The repeated loading of combase.dll by SDXHelper.exe is also something to note, though without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of using certutil for encoding\/decoding files in Temp directories, multiple registry modifications, and process creations with potentially malicious command lines (like the cmd.exe script) suggests a high likelihood of suspicious activity. The presence of these activities together might indicate an attack chain, such as initial access, lateral movement, or payload execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of certutil.exe being used to encode and decode files in the Temp directory, along with numerous registry modifications across processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe. These activities suggest potential malicious behavior such as payload generation or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is a JSON object on its own line. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they all come from 'chrome.exe' and mention network connections being detected. That's normal because Chrome handles a lot of network traffic as it's a browser. The same goes for subsequent Chrome events; some are about registry values being set, which also sounds typical for legitimate software operations.\n\nThen there's an event where 'powershell.exe' creates a file named 'componente_auxiliar.txt'. PowerShell is often used by both admins and attackers, so this could be suspicious. Creating files with names that don't immediately seem standard might indicate something malicious.\n\nNext, I see events from 'SDXHelper.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll', which is a known DLL for URL handling in Windows. That doesn't raise red flags on its own. There's also an event where 'winlogbeat.exe' creates a configuration file, which is expected if it's part of the log management setup.\n\nAnother PowerShell event sets a registry value and accesses processes. This could be concerning because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for command execution or to modify system configurations. The multiple registry accesses might indicate attempts to establish persistence or change system behavior in a way that's not easily reversible.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated activity from Chrome seems normal, but the PowerShell actions are more suspicious. The creation of 'componente_auxiliar.txt' and multiple registry modifications could be signs of malicious activity, especially since they're coming from a process known for its dual-use capabilities. While individual events might not be alarming, the combination suggests potential foul play.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there's enough concerning behavior, particularly with PowerShell, that warrants closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from chrome.exe and powershell.exe. Notably, powershell.exe created a file named 'componente_auxiliar.txt' which may be suspicious. Additionally, there are several registry access events which could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
