{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a Chrome.exe process with a DNS query. That seems normal because browsers do a lot of DNS lookups. Then there's PowerShell creating a process and setting registry values. Registry modifications can be tricky—good guys and bad guys both use them. But seeing it in PowerShell might raise an eyebrow since it's often used for scripting, which could be malicious.\n\nNext up is cmd.exe running systeminfo and reg query. Systeminfo alone isn't bad, but combining it with a registry query might indicate someone is gathering system info to map out vulnerabilities or configurations. Also, multiple instances of cmd.exe accessing the registry could be concerning if seen in quick succession.\n\nThere's another PowerShell process accessed again, which makes me think maybe there's a script running. Then cmd.exe sets another registry value—could be persistence mechanisms or trying to change system settings.\n\nNotepad.exe setting a registry value is interesting because Notepad isn't typically used for that. Maybe it's part of some exploit? Or perhaps a legitimate action but unusual enough to note.\n\nCalculator.exe loading urlmon.dll seems odd. Calculator shouldn't need that DLL, which is involved in URL handling. This might be an attempt to inject code or load malicious components.\n\nWmiPrvSE.exe creating processes and loading wmiutils.dll—this process is known for WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) services. Malware often uses WMI for persistence or privilege escalation. Seeing multiple instances or unusual activity here could be a red flag.\n\nsvchost.exe creating files in winevt\/Logs directories—I know svchost runs various system services, but creating log files there might be part of normal operation. However, if these files are created abnormally or contain suspicious data, it could indicate malicious activity. But without more context on the content, it's hard to say.\n\nsvchost.exe modifying registry again—multiple registry changes from different processes like svchost and cmd.exe might indicate someone trying to leave persistent backdoors or alter system configurations.\n\nreg.exe querying a specific registry path is another data-gathering step, possibly for enumerating services or drivers. This could be part of an attack vector looking for installed software or vulnerabilities.\n\nconhost.exe setting a registry value—conhost is usually related to console windows, so using it for registry modifications seems out of place and might suggest some process injection or malicious activity.\n\nservices.exe logon and a special logon event without a process name. Special logons often relate to system processes or services starting up. But without more context, it's hard to assess if this is normal or part of an exploit.\n\nPutting all these together, I notice multiple processes accessing the registry (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, notepad.exe, conhost.exe), which could be a sign of data gathering or configuration changes. The use of WmiPrvSE and svchost.exe with unusual file creations and registry modifications stands out as potentially malicious activities often associated with advanced persistent threats or sophisticated malware. Additionally, the repeated attempts to query system information (systeminfo.exe) and registry entries (HKLM\\SYSTEM...) suggest an adversary trying to map the system's layout, possibly preparing for an attack.\n\nHowever, it's also possible these are legitimate scripts or normal operations in some environments. But given the combination of multiple unusual activities across different processes and the use of tools like PowerShell and WMI which are common in attacks, this batch raises enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry modifications, process creations, and file operations involving suspicious processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and svchost.exe suggest potential malicious activity. The combination of these events could indicate data gathering or system configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a process named winlogbeat.exe that created a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so that seems normal. Then ApplicationFrameHost.exe set a registry value; this is a legitimate Windows process, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe setting a registry value and accessing another process. PowerShell can do a lot, both good and bad. But without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious. However, there are multiple events from chrome.exe setting registry values, which seems unusual because Chrome shouldn't need to modify the registry that much.\n\nAlso, some of these events involve loading images like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are legitimate Windows Defender components. But seeing so many RegistryEvent tasks in such a short time, especially from the same process repeatedly, could indicate something malicious trying to persist or spread across the system.\n\nAdditionally, there's another event where powershell.exe created a file named objeto_padrao.txt, which translates to \"default_object\" in Portuguese. The filename doesn't immediately raise red flags, but combined with other activities, it might be worth looking into.\n\nConsidering all these events together, while individually they don't all look bad, the volume and combination of registry modifications by non-standard processes like chrome.exe could indicate suspicious activity. There's also the repeated file creation by winlogbeat and powershell, which, if part of a campaign, could be concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry modification events from non-standard processes like chrome.exe and powershell.exe. The high frequency of such modifications may indicate malicious activity, especially combined with file creation by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to classify this batch of events as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING.\" \n\nFirst, I look at each event in the JSONL. Each line is a separate event with three keys: process, winlog, and file. \n\nStarting with the first event:\n- Process name is 'chrome.exe', which is a common browser, so that's normal.\n- Winlog shows a registry value being set via a rule named 'RegistryEvent'. This could be either legitimate or malicious, but by itself, it might not be suspicious because some apps do modify the registry.\n\nNext, looking at the second event:\n- The process name here is null. That's interesting because I don't see any associated file either. So no file path to indicate what process is running.\n- Winlog again mentions 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'. Another registry change without a clear process context.\n\nThe third event has a similar structure:\n- Process is still null, and there's no file information.\n- Same registry event as before.\n\nPutting it all together, having multiple events where the registry is being modified might be concerning. But since each event is isolated and doesn't provide enough context about what process or file is involved, it's hard to tell if this is malicious activity. Chrome.exe modifying the registry is normal for updates or settings changes, but repeated null processes with similar log entries could indicate something more suspicious.\n\nHowever, without additional information like timestamps, user details, or specific registry keys affected, I'm not certain enough to classify this as definitely interesting. The events don't provide a clear pattern or anomalies beyond the same action being logged multiple times. So, while there's some concern, it doesn't rise to the level of clearly needing investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve standard registry modifications by known processes like chrome.exe and lack sufficient context or anomalies to warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}\n```"}
