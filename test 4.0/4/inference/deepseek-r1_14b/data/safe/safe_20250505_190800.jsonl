{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event is about.\n\nFirst, there's a process named winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal because it's likely part of the logging setup.\n\nNext, mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE are setting registry values. These are common system processes, so no red flags there.\n\nThen, powershell.exe is starting multiple times with different tasks. The command line path looks standard for PowerShell. There are several events where it loads image files from known .NET and framework locations, which is normal when running scripts.\n\nI also notice a few events related to provider lifecycle and engine lifecycle in PowerShell. These are typical as part of script execution.\n\nThe interesting part comes with the file operations. Powershell.exe creates a temp file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1, then deletes it almost immediately after creation. This behavior is suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly can be a sign of malicious activity trying to bypass detection or leave minimal traces.\n\nAdditionally, there's a pipe created by powershell.exe, which could be used for inter-process communication. While not inherently malicious, combined with the file deletions, it raises concerns about potential command execution or lateral movement.\n\nLooking at all these together, the repeated PowerShell usage, quick file creation\/deletion, and image loading from various legitimate locations might indicate script execution testing system policies or attempting to run unauthorized code. These activities don't align with standard user behavior and could be early signs of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances creating, deleting temporary files quickly may indicate script execution or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm trying to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries involving `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities and can execute commands on remote systems. The fact that there are several instances where PowerShell is creating files and accessing registry values might be a red flag. For example, the creation of `.ps1` scripts like `teste.ps1` and others in different locations could indicate malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the events, I notice that `powershell.exe` is being executed with the command line `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`, which is commonly used to run scripts without user interaction. This is a technique attackers use to avoid detection since it allows execution of unsigned scripts. Additionally, there are file creation and deletion activities in temporary directories, which might be part of an attempt to hide malicious scripts.\n\nThe batch also shows `winlogbeat.exe` creating files related to its configuration, which seems normal for the log shipping tool. However, the combination with PowerShell's actions raises suspicion because attackers often use legitimate tools alongside their own scripts to blend in.\n\nAnother point is the remote command execution event without any associated file path, which could be an attempt to carry out malicious activities over the network. This kind of activity is hard to trace and can be part of a broader attack strategy.\n\nConsidering all these points together—use of PowerShell with Bypass Execution Policy, creation of script files in various locations, registry modifications, image loading of DLLs (which might be for obfuscation or persistence), temporary file operations, and remote command execution—it's clear that the activities are not typical user behavior. They exhibit several indicators of potential malicious activity.\n\nTherefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events including file creation, registry modifications, and remote command execution suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
