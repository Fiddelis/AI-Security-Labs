Let me go through each event one by one to see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events from \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading different DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. That seems a bit repetitive but maybe normal for some system process.\n\nThen there are several entries with null process and file info, tasks like User Account Management or Registry value set. Those could be standard Windows activities, not necessarily suspicious.\n\nI see \"rundll32.exe\" being used with a command line argument that includes shell32.dll and a GUID. Rundll32 is commonly used for running DLL functions, but the specific GUID here doesn't ring any bells as malicious. It might be part of legitimate Windows operations or some application's setup.\n\nThere are events from \"svchost.exe\" modifying registry values. Svchost is a standard system process that runs services, so this could just be normal service-related activity.\n\n\"winlogbeat.exe\" creating files in its data directory sounds like it's the log shipping agent doing its job, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nEXCEL.EXE events are popping upâ€”opening a CSV file and loading various DLLs. This seems routine for Excel running normally, especially if it's processing data or opening files as part of its operation.\n\nI also see \"RuntimeBroker.exe\" making registry changes. Runtime Broker is related to UWP app containerization, so again, that's expected behavior.\n\n\"WmiPrvSE.exe\" executing with a command line involving wbem and wmiutils.dll seems normal for WMI-related processes. It's part of Windows Management Instrumentation, used for system management tasks.\n\nLooking at all these events together, they seem to be a mix of standard Windows operations, process creations, file accesses, and registry modifications. There's nothing here that stands out as overtly malicious or unusual enough to warrant investigation. The repetition might indicate a script or application running multiple times, but without more context on what each event corresponds to, it's hard to say if any are suspicious.\n\nI don't see any signs of known malware indicators like specific file paths, unexpected process names, or irregular API calls. All the processes and DLLs referenced are standard Windows components or legitimate applications like Excel and rundll32.\n\nTherefore, I think this batch isn't particularly interesting from a security standpoint. It looks like normal system activity without any red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of standard Windows operations such as process creation, file access, and registry modifications, with no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few events are all similar: they have a null process, a Windows log task related to User Account Management, and no file information. So these are about user account changes or something like that. I don't know if that's suspicious on its own because accounts can be managed for legitimate reasons.\n\nThen there's an event where the process is Excel.exe. It says the task is Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad) and it points to a file path in System32, which is a standard Windows directory. So loading system files shouldn't be unusual unless it's something unexpected like a DLL being loaded by an untrusted process.\n\nNext events also involve Excel.exe but with DNS queries. Again, applications often perform DNS lookups when connecting to servers or fetching data online. This could be normal if Excel is trying to access some service, though I'm not sure why Excel would need that unless it's part of its functionality.\n\nThen there are two file creation events for the same path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\Recent\\real_values.csv.LNK. This is a shortcut file in the Recent folder. It seems like Excel created or accessed this file, which could be part of normal operations if it's tracking recent documents.\n\nThere are several events where both process and winlog fields are null, so I'm not sure what those represent. Maybe they're just placeholder entries or unrelated to the main activity.\n\nLooking at the confidence level, I think there might be some red flags here. The repeated file creation of the same .LNK file could indicate that Excel is trying to access a specific shortcut repeatedly. Also, the use of EXCEL.EXE as the process name might seem normal, but if it's performing multiple unexpected actions like DNS queries and file operations, that might warrant closer investigation.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if these activities are malicious or just part of legitimate operations, but the repetition and combination of different tasks could suggest something more than usual user activity. So I'll classify this as INTERESTING with a moderate confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple Excel.exe processes show repeated DNS queries and file creation activities, which may indicate suspicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
