The files are in a directory named \"node_modules\", which usually suggests it's part of a Node.js project. Looking closer at the file names, they end with .d.ts, which I think stands for TypeScript declaration files.\n\nSo, putting this together, it seems like these events are related to the creation of various TypeScript type definition files during a git process.

So, we're looking at file creation events. The paths provided all point to files in the same directory: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\". These are TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) for various functions like isError, isFinite, isFunction, etc.\n\nNow, putting this together: Git creating multiple files in a node_modules directory suggests that this is part of the build or installation process for a Node.js project.

Each event is a JSON object, and there are multiple lines, each representing one JSON object. The task here is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, let me parse what each event looks like. Each line has three main components: process information, windows log info, and file details.\n\nThe \"process\" field in each event shows that the name is \"git.exe\". So all these events are related to the Git executable running some operations. The \"winlog\" field indicates that the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means a new file was created on the system. \n\nLooking at the \"file\" field, each event has a path starting with \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\\" followed by various filenames like isRegExp.d.ts, isSafeInteger.d.ts, and so on. These seem to be TypeScript files related to Lodash's functional programming utilities (the 'fp' directory).\n\nSo, putting this together, all these events are file creation events triggered by git.exe in a specific directory. The path looks like part of a node_modules folder within a project named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\", which is probably a course or module related to software quality.\n\nNow, considering the nature of Git and how it's used for version control, especially when dealing with large projects that include node_modules (which can be quite extensive), it's not unusual for Git to create files during operations like cloning, fetching, or checking out branches. These could be part of a normal development workflow where dependencies are being managed.\n\nI need to determine if this batch is \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". The classification depends on whether these events might indicate malicious activity or something suspicious that warrants further investigation.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within a node_modules directory. This suggests it's related to JavaScript package installations, which are standard in Node.js development environments. The creation of many .d.ts files (TypeScript declaration files) is typical when installing TypeScript modules, especially for tools like Lodash. \n\nSince git.exe is creating these files, it could be part of a process where the project is being synchronized or built. There's nothing inherently suspicious about Git creating files in node_modules as that's a common operation during development.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any red flags. For instance, if these files were created outside the expected directories or if the timestamps suggest unusual activity (like late-night file creations), but with the given data, there's no indication of that. All events seem to be happening in the same directory and relate to the same project.\n\nAnother angle is whether this pattern of multiple file creations from git.exe could indicate some form of automated process or script running, possibly malicious. But without more context, like unusual user activity or other logs indicating system compromise, it's hard to say. However, given that these are standard operations within a development environment, it's less likely to be malicious.\n\nSo, taking into account the information provided, this batch doesn't exhibit signs of malicious behavior. It appears to be part of normal Git operations related to managing project dependencies.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events in this batch show multiple file creation actions by git.exe within a node_modules directory, which is typical during development workflows and not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe in a standard development environment's node_modules directory, likely part of normal dependency management.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The winlog field indicates that a file was created, with the rule being \"FileCreate\". The file paths are all under different .d.ts files in the node_modules folder related to Cypress and lodash. \n\nI'm thinking about what each part means. git.exe is commonly used for version control, so it's not unusual for it to create files during development tasks like cloning repositories or installing dependencies. The fact that multiple files are being created by git.exe seems normal if someone is working on a project using these tools.\n\nThe file paths point to TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) within the Cypress and lodash packages. These are standard files when you're using npm or yarn to manage your node modules, as they help with type checking in TypeScript projects.

The user provided 14 events, each with a process named \"git.exe\", a file creation task in Windows logs, and specific file paths.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. They all come from the same process, git.exe. File creations are pretty common, especially during development activities where files might be downloaded or cloned from a repository. The files being created are located under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\" with various .d.ts file names.\n\n.d.ts files are TypeScript declaration files, which means they're part of a TypeScript project. Cypress is a testing framework for JavaScript applications, and node_modules indicates these are dependencies managed by npm. So, it seems like the user is working on a project that uses TypeScript and Cypress.\n\nLooking at the batch, all events are file creation tasks performed by git.exe. This suggests that during a Git operation (like cloning or updating a repository), several files were created in the node_modules directory.

There's no indication of unexpected processes, access to restricted areas, or attempts to execute code. All activities align with standard Git operations and software development practices.\n\nHowever, I should consider if the number of events is significant. 14 file creations in a row might seem a bit much, but during an initial clone or sync, it's possible for multiple files to be created at once. It doesn't raise any red flags because legitimate processes can create several files quickly when setting up dependencies.\n\nAnother point to consider is the consistency of the data. All events have similar structures and sources, which makes me think they're part of a single process. If there were inconsistencies or came from different sources, that might warrant further investigation, but that's not the case here.\n\nIn summary, these events are likely part of a normal software development workflow.

My task is to determine whether this entire batch of events is interesting for investigation or not. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of each event. Each line is a JSON object with three main fields: process, winlog, and file. \n\n- The process field has \"git.exe\" as the name in every entry. This tells me that all these events are related to Git, which is commonly used for version control.\n- The winlog field consistently shows \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So each event indicates a file creation action.\n- The file paths vary but they all point to files within the node_modules directory of a Cypress project. For example, one path is \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\uuid.d.ts\" and so on.\n\nSo, all these events are file creation activities by Git.exe in the node_modules folder of a Cypress project. This suggests that someone is working with this project, possibly during development or setup.\n\nNow, considering cybersecurity from an incident response perspective, when do we consider events interesting? Typically, if they indicate potential malicious activity, such as unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or known attack patterns. \n\nIn this case, all the events are legitimate actions taken by a user interacting with their development environment. Git is a standard tool used in software development, and creating files within node_modules is part of installing dependencies for a Node.js project, which Cypress is built on.\n\nThere's no indication here of any unusual behavior or signs of compromise. The same process name (git.exe) and the same type of log entry (file creation) repeat across all events, which aligns with normal development workflows rather than malicious activities.\n\nTherefore, I wouldn't classify this batch as interesting for further investigation because there's nothing out of the ordinary in these logs.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation by git.exe during development setup and do not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

All the events have the same structure: they're created by git.exe, and they're all \"File created\" tasks according to winlog. The file paths are all within the node_modules folder of a Cypress project, specifically under the lodash directory.\n\nHmm, so first off, I know that when you install Node.js packages like Cypress, it's normal for files to be created in the node_modules directory as part of the installation process. These types of events would typically occur during development work where someone is setting up or updating their project dependencies.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all end with .d.ts, which I think are TypeScript definition files. So this is likely happening when the Cypress package and its lodash type definitions are being installed or updated. The fact that git.exe is involved makes sense because Git is often used for version control in development environments, especially with tools like npm where packages might be checked out into node_modules.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual activity here. All events are from the same process creating multiple files in a standard location during what appears to be normal package installation or updates. There's no indication of file creation outside expected directories, access to sensitive files, or other red flags that might suggest malicious behavior.\n\nSo considering all this, it seems like these events are part of routine development processes and don't pose any security concerns.

All the events are from a process named \"git.exe\" and involve files being created in specific paths under the node_modules folder for Cypress types.\n\nFirst, I notice that each event is very similar. They all come from git.exe and create files related to Lodash types in a Node.js project. Since these are file creation events within a typical project structure, especially in a development environment where node_modules are common, this doesn't raise any immediate red flags.\n\nThe paths mentioned are standard for a setup using tools like Cypress and Lodash. The repeated \"File created\" tasks under git.exe suggest that Git is indexing or updating its cache, which is normal during development activities. There's no indication of unusual file names, locations outside the project directory, or attempts to access restricted areas.\n\nI also consider the volume of events—there are 14 entries here, each creating a different .d.ts file in the same location. This seems consistent with how Git might handle multiple files during operations like cloning, pulling, or updating dependencies. No single event stands out as malicious, and the pattern doesn't suggest anything beyond regular development workflow.\n\nGiven all this, I don't see any signs of suspicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I've been given a set of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to analyze the entire batch to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, looking at each event, they all have similar structures but are individual entries. Each line starts with a process named \"git.exe\", which suggests that Git is being used here. The winlog task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that files are being created. The file paths vary slightly in their filenames but share the same directory structure.\n\nI notice that all these events are happening under the same user account, \"fiddelis\", and within a specific folder path related to a course on \"Qualidade de Software\" (which is Portuguese for \"Software Quality\"). Additionally, all files being created are TypeScript (.d.ts) files located inside the node_modules directory of a Cypress project. This makes me think that this user might be working on a software development project using tools like Git and Cypress for testing.\n\nConsidering the context, it's common for developers to clone repositories, run commands (like npm install or running tests), which can create multiple files in the node_modules folder. The fact that all these events are about file creation by git.exe suggests that perhaps there was a recent checkout, update, or sync operation done via Git.\n\nI should also consider whether such activity is typical and could indicate malicious behavior. However, since Git is a standard tool used in development environments and creating files in node_modules is part of normal package installations for JavaScript projects, this doesn't raise any red flags. There's no evidence of unusual file paths or activities that are commonly associated with malware.\n\nMoreover, looking at the frequency and volume of these events—14 entries in total—all related to file creation by Git—it seems consistent with legitimate operations rather than something malicious. If there were signs like multiple failed attempts, access to sensitive files, or inconsistencies with user activity, I might consider it suspicious. But here, everything points to normal development work.\n\nIn summary, while each event on its own could be monitored for consistency within a baseline of normal activities, collectively they don't indicate any malicious behavior. Therefore, the batch as a whole isn't particularly interesting from a security investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to legitimate file creation activities by Git during development work, showing standard operations within a software project's node_modules directory.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each one is a JSON object with details about a file creation event on Windows.

That's a common tool used for version control, especially in JavaScript projects because of npm. The file paths all lead into a node_modules folder, which is typical in Node.js applications where dependencies are stored. Cypress is a popular testing framework for web applications, and lodash is a well-known utility library in JavaScript.\n\nLooking at the task in each event: it's always \"File created\" with the rule \"FileCreate\". So these are standard file creation events being logged by the system. The files themselves are TypeScript type definitions (.d.ts), which makes sense because when you install npm packages, they often include type definitions for IDEs and other tools to provide better code completion and error checking.\n\nNow, considering whether this batch is interesting or not: Since all these events are related to a user installing or updating their development environment, it doesn't raise any red flags. There's no indication of unusual activity, such as files being created outside the expected directories, execution of scripts, or access to sensitive areas. The process is git.exe, which is legitimate, and the file paths are standard for a Node.js project setup.\n\nI also consider the possibility of these events being part of a malicious payload. However, given that they're all within the node_modules folder and are related to known libraries like Cypress and lodash, it's unlikely. Malware or attack activities would typically involve more varied processes, unexpected file locations, or attempts to access restricted areas.\n\nAnother angle is whether multiple file creations in this context could be a sign of something nefarious. But in this case, each file creation is part of the expected setup for a development environment using npm and TypeScript. It's common during installations or when dependencies are updated.\n\nI also think about the confidence level. Since all events align with normal user behavior, especially in a development setting, I'm highly confident that these events aren't indicative of malicious activity. There's no deviation from what would be expected when someone is setting up or working on a project using these tools.\n\nIn summary, analyzing this batch as a whole shows consistent and legitimate file creation activities related to software development tools and libraries.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object representing some log data. The first thing I notice is that every entry has the process name as \"git.exe\". That immediately makes me think it's related to Git operations since Git is commonly used for version control and might be running on a system, perhaps a developer's machine.\n\nLooking deeper into each event, they all share similar attributes: the task is \"File created\" with a rule named \"FileCreate\". The file paths vary, but they're all under the same directory structure. Specifically, the files being created are in the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\" followed by different filenames ending with \".d.ts\".\n\nI recall that .d.ts files are TypeScript declaration files. These are typically used to define interfaces and types without the implementation, often generated alongside JavaScript\/TypeScript projects. Cypress is a testing framework for web applications, so it's plausible that this system is setting up or modifying a project that uses Cypress with TypeScript.\n\nThe fact that multiple files are being created under the same directory by the same process suggests that this might be part of an installation or build process. Git.exe creating files in a node_modules directory points towards npm scripts or other package managers using Git for version control operations, though it's more common to see npm-related processes like \"npm install\" or \"yarn add\". However, sometimes scripts can execute other commands.\n\nAnother angle is that these events could be part of a legitimate development workflow. Developers often work with multiple files and directories when setting up or modifying projects. The creation of several .d.ts files might indicate the setup phase where type definitions are being generated or updated.\n\nI also consider whether this activity is indicative of malicious behavior. While it's possible for attackers to disguise their actions as legitimate processes, in this case, the consistent use of \"git.exe\" and the file paths related to a project's node_modules don't raise immediate red flags. Malicious actors usually aim to stay under the radar and might not create multiple files with predictable naming conventions.\n\nHowever, I'm cautious because sometimes attackers use common tools for malicious purposes. But given that these are just file creation events without any signs of unusual permissions changes, network activity, or other indicators, it seems less likely to be suspicious. \n\nThe volume of files created here is another point. While creating multiple files isn't inherently bad, the fact that they're all .d.ts and under a specific path might suggest a script or automated process is at work. But again, in development environments, such scripts are common.\n\nI also think about how to verify if this activity is normal. If I were investigating this on an actual system, I'd check the user account running these processes, see if there's any associated network traffic, and look for other logs around the same time that might provide context. Since all events come from Git.exe, which is a legitimate tool, it's more about determining the intended use.\n\nIn conclusion, while nothing here screams \"malicious,\" the fact that Git.exe is creating multiple files in a node_modules directory could still be of interest for investigation. It's possible that this activity is related to a project setup or an automated script, but without more context, there's some uncertainty. Therefore, it might be worth looking into to ensure that all these file creations are part of the expected workflow and not something else.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files being created by git.exe in a node_modules directory may indicate suspicious or automated activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Specifically, it says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So this indicates that a file was created by the git.exe process. The file paths all point to different TypeScript files within the node_modules directory of a Cypress installation. For example, one file is \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\nthArg.d.ts\", and there are several others like omit.d.ts, omitBy.d.ts, etc.\n\nI know that node_modules is where npm packages are stored, so this makes sense in the context of a development environment.

There's no indication of file accesses that shouldn't happen or any anomalies in the timestamps or frequency of these events.\n\nSo overall, this batch doesn't look interesting from a security standpoint. It seems like normal development activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating files related to Cypress and Lodash type definitions in a standard project structure, which is typical during development.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
