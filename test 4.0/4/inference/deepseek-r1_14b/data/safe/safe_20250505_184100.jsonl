{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's look at what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I see a bunch of JSONL entries. Each line has a process, some log task, and maybe a file path. The first event is DiscordSetup.exe being created. That makes sense because it's the installer for Discord. Then there are ImageLoad events pointing to that setup file, which is normal during installation.\n\nNext, FileCreate events show files like Update.exe appearing in different locations. I know Discord sometimes uses SquirrelTemp for updates, so this could be an update process. The fact that Update.exe is being created and accessed multiple times might just be part of the standard update procedure.\n\nLooking at the ImageLoad entries, there are several DLLs being loaded from Windows directories. That's typical when an application runs on Windows; it loads necessary system libraries. Also, the use of mscoree and clrjit suggests that Update.exe is perhaps a .NET-based application or installer, which isn't unusual for updates.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event for winlogbeat.yml.new, but I don't think that's related to any malicious activity; it might be from an ELK stack tool like Filebeat or something similar, just logging its configuration.\n\nI'm noticing multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. These are likely due to other processes accessing the Update.exe file, maybe during installation or updates, which is normal in Windows environments as different services check on each other.\n\nPutting it all together, these logs seem to follow a standard pattern of installing Discord and handling an update via SquirrelTemp. There's nothing here indicating unusual behavior like strange file paths, unexpected processes, or access times that don't make sense for an installer\/update. The repetition of certain tasks is within the expected range for such activities.\n\nI'm confident that this batch isn't showing signs of malicious activity. It looks like normal operation for a Discord setup and update process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events describe normal Discord installation and update processes, including the creation and loading of necessary files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through each event step by step and see if I can spot anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first event: It's an update.exe process accessing something. That seems normal for updates. Next, Discord.exe is being created with a specific command line. The path looks legitimate, pointing to where Discord is installed.\n\nThen there are multiple events of Update.exe accessing processes and files. This could be part of an update check or actual update execution. I don't see anything odd in the file paths here; they're standard system files.\n\nDiscord.exe is creating pipes multiple times. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, especially for applications like Discord that might have background processes or crash handlers.\n\nI notice some events where Update.exe loads mscoree.dll and other .NET framework components. That's typical for executables using the .NET runtime. No red flags there.\n\nThe command line in one of the Discord.exe processes includes parameters like --type=crashpad-handler, which suggests it's handling crashes. This is standard behavior to catch exceptions and report them.\n\nLooking at all events together, I don't see any signs of malicious activity. All processes are either updates or Discord-related, both legitimate applications. There's no indication of unknown files being executed or network connections that seem suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events relate to normal operations of the Discord application and its update mechanism, including process creation, file loading, and inter-process communication.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is an update.exe process loading the clrjit.dll file. That seems normal because .NET framework files are typically loaded during application execution. No red flags here.\n\nNext, there's a Discord.exe process creating a pipe. Pipes in Windows are commonly used for inter-process communication, so this doesn't seem suspicious on its own. I know Discord is a chat application that might use pipes for various tasks like voice or data transfer between different components.\n\nThe third event shows Discord starting with a detailed command line. This includes parameters like --type=gpu-process and several disabled features. These are standard flags to optimize performance, manage GPU usage, and disable certain experimental features. The variations in the field trial handles could be part of feature testing or analytics. Nothing here looks out of place.\n\nThen there's a process access event for Discord.exe. Processes accessing each other can happen when debugging or monitoring tools check on them, but it's also common in legitimate applications to manage their own components.\n\nAnother ImageLoad event for the same Discord.exe file is normal as the application initializes and loads its modules.\n\nA Pipe Created event again for Discord seems like part of its communication mechanism. Not a concern.\n\nThe sixth event has another Process Create for Discord with different command-line parameters, including --type=utility and specific services like NetworkService. This looks legitimate, possibly starting a utility process that handles network functions. The flags here are consistent with how applications manage their services and dependencies.\n\nAnother Process Access event follows, which is standard during application setup or when components communicate.\n\nThen there's an ImageLoad for ffmpeg.dll. Discord uses FFmpeg for audio and video processing, so loading this library is expected. No issues here.\n\nThe next events again involve Discord accessing processes and files, but nothing seems amiss. It might be checking dependencies or initializing modules.\n\nLooking further, I notice two FileCreate events by Update.exe creating shortcuts in the Start Menu. Shortcuts are common during software installations or updates to add entries for the application. The paths point to Discord Inc., which aligns with normal installation procedures.\n\nThe last few events show Update.exe accessing processes, which could be part of a setup routine checking if Discord is running before proceeding.\n\nOverall, all these events seem related to the operation and initialization of Discord and its update process. There's no indication of malicious activities like unauthorized access, encryption, or unusual file modifications. The presence of standard system calls and known application behaviors doesn't raise any red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal operations involving Discord.exe and Update.exe, including process creation, image loading, pipe creation, file access, and shortcut creation in the Start Menu.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. First off, I notice that most of the events involve either \"Update.exe\" or \"Discord.exe\". Let's break it down.\n\nThe first few lines are all about Update.exe accessing something with ProcessAccess. That seems pretty generic—any program might do that when starting up. But then there's a FileCreate event where Update.exe creates a Discord.lnk file on the desktop. A .lnk file is a shortcut, so maybe that's just setting up a quick way to launch Discord.\n\nThen I see several ImageLoad events from Discord.exe loading various DLLs like d3dcompiler_47.dll and libGLESv2.dll. These look like standard graphics-related libraries, which makes sense because Discord probably uses them for rendering or gaming features. So those might not be red flags on their own.\n\nLooking further, there's a ProcessAccess event from Update.exe accessing something else, but no file involved this time. The events repeat multiple times with the same processes and actions, which suggests it's part of a normal setup or update process rather than anything malicious.\n\nI'm also considering if there are any anomalies. For example, does Update.exe running so many times raise a red flag? It could be part of an update routine, especially since it's creating Discord shortcuts in different locations—like the desktop and the start menu. That seems like standard behavior for software wanting to add itself to launch points.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual file creation or access beyond what would typically happen with a legitimate application. No files being deleted or modified outside the expected scope. The repetition of ProcessAccess events might just be part of multiple processes starting or interacting, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's suspicious.\n\nIn summary, while there are several events, they don't collectively point to anything malicious. It looks like normal operations for Discord and an update process. So I'd classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of multiple events related to a legitimate application's processes, such as creating shortcuts and loading standard libraries, which do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is \"Update.exe\" with tasks like ProcessAccess and FileCreate. Specifically, I see that Update.exe created a file at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Desktop\\Discord.lnk\". That's a shortcut on the desktop. Then, it accessed processes multiple times before terminating.\n\nNext, there are events involving Discord.exe. These include Pipe Created events and ProcessAccess tasks. Notably, I also see instances where reg.exe is being used with command lines to modify the registry. For example, the commands add HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run and others under Software\\Classes\\Discord. This seems like it's setting up Discord as a URL protocol handler.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern suggests that Update.exe created a shortcut on the desktop for Discord and then terminated. The Discord.exe process is creating pipes, which could be normal for interprocess communication, but combined with the registry modifications via reg.exe, it looks suspicious. Registering protocols and adding entries to the Run key can allow an application to start automatically and handle URLs, which might be part of a malicious payload trying to establish persistence or manipulate how the system handles certain protocols.\n\nI'm also noticing that multiple instances are creating these registry keys, which could indicate an attempt to ensure the changes stick. The repeated ProcessAccess events on Discord.exe might be indicative of it being hooked or controlled by another process.\n\nGiven all this, the activity seems like it could be related to a malicious payload trying to install itself, set up persistence, and manipulate system behavior. This makes the batch of events interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events indicate possible unauthorized registry modifications and process interactions that may suggest malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where the process name is \"Discord.exe\". That makes sense because Discord is a common application people use. Some of these events mention tasks like \"Pipe Created\", \"Process accessed\", and \"Process terminated\". These seem normal for an application running, especially Discord which might have background processes or pipes for communication.\n\nLooking at the second event, there's a process named \"reg.exe\" being used with command lines that modify the registry. The commands are adding entries to HKCU under Software\\Classes\\Discord and setting default icons and shell commands. This looks like part of Discord's normal setup or update process. I've heard that some applications use reg.exe to tweak their settings or create shortcuts.\n\nAnother event shows \"Update.exe\" being used, which could be part of Discord's update mechanism. The events where files are loaded (ImageLoad) for Discord.exe and ffmpeg.dll also seem routine since Discord likely uses these libraries for functionality. There's even a .lnk file being created in the Start Menu, which is typical when an application installs or updates its shortcut.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here. All the processes are related to Discord and its operations—starting, accessing resources, updating, etc. The use of reg.exe isn't malicious in this context; it's just modifying the system's registry for proper operation.\n\nSince all events fit within expected activities of a user running Discord, there doesn't seem to be any indication of suspicious or malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch doesn't require further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal operations of the Discord application, including process creation, registry modifications, file access, and termination.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the events, I see a lot of entries from Update.exe and Discord-related processes. The majority are process access events and some file creations. There's also a registry value set event and a process termination. Then there are a couple of DNS queries and pipe creation events by Discord.exe.\n\nI know that Update.exe could be legitimate for software updates, but seeing it accessing files and the registry might raise flags. However, the repeated ProcessAccess tasks don't seem unusual on their own if it's part of normal operations.\n\nThe creation of a .lnk file in the user's directory is interesting because shortcut files can sometimes be used maliciously. But without more context, like suspicious network activity or known malware indicators, it might not be harmful.\n\nDiscord processes are common and usually don't pose a threat unless they're interacting with unexpected resources or exhibiting abnormal behavior. The command line arguments for Discord.exe seem standard for the application's functionality, including crashpad handling and annotations, which align with expected operations.\n\nThe pipe creation events by Discord could be part of inter-process communication, which is typical in legitimate applications. There's also a DNS query from Discord.exe, which is normal as apps often need to resolve domains.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there isn't enough evidence to suggest malicious activity. While some actions like file creation and registry changes can be indicators, they don't collectively point towards an attack or exploit. The repetition of similar events by the same processes also doesn't raise significant red flags without additional anomalies.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists primarily of normal process and file activities, including legitimate updates and Discord operations, with no clear signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

The user is running Discord, which is a common application for gaming and communication. The events include process creation, access, image loading, pipe creation, and file accesses.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. **Process Creation**: There are two instances where Discord starts as different types of processes (gpu-process and utility). This is normal since applications like Discord use multiple processes for different functionalities.\n2. **File Accesses**: The files being loaded are standard for Discord—like ffmpeg.dll, updater.node, d3dcompiler, etc. These are legitimate components needed for the app to run smoothly.\n3. **Pipe Created**: Communication between processes via named pipes is typical and not suspicious on its own.\n\nThere's nothing unusual in these events. They all seem to be part of Discord's normal operation. I don't see any signs of malicious activities like file creations in unexpected locations, attempts to access restricted areas, or network connections to known bad domains.\n\nThe command lines provided also look standard for Discord processes, with flags that are commonly used for configuration and feature toggling. No red flags here, such as unusual arguments or external libraries being loaded.\n\nSince all events align with expected behavior of a running Discord application, there's no need for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal process creation and file access events related to the Discord application.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. So, the user has given me a set of JSONL logs related to Discord.exe and other processes on a Windows system. My task is to determine if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first event shows Discord.exe creating a file, specifically a .lnk shortcut on the desktop. That seems normal because applications often create their shortcuts when installed or run.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where Discord.exe is accessing processes (Process accessed). These events don't have any files associated with them. Process access can be common in legitimate operations, like accessing DLLs or other system components. However, repeated process accesses might raise an eyebrow if they're too frequent or target unusual areas.\n\nThen, there's a command line event where reg.exe is used to add a registry entry under HKCU. The command sets the value of \"URL:Discord Protocol\" in the Discord key within the Classes hive. This looks like it's setting up a custom protocol handler for Discord, which makes sense because many applications register their own protocols during installation. But I should consider if this is part of a malicious payload or just standard behavior.\n\nLooking at all these events together, they seem to be normal operations associated with running and configuring Discord. The creation of shortcuts, accessing processes, and registering protocols are typical activities for an application like Discord. There's no indication of unusual file accesses, network connections, or other red flags that might suggest malicious activity.\n\nI also notice the repetition: multiple Process accessed events without any anomalies, which could be part of Discord's normal operation. The Pipe Created events might relate to inter-process communication, again a common legitimate activity.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING.\" There's no evidence of suspicious behavior or indicators of compromise in the logs provided.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal operations of Discord.exe, including creating shortcuts, accessing processes, and registering protocols.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where Discord.exe is starting and accessing various components. The first event shows Discord being launched with a specific command line, which seems normal since it's just the program starting. Then there are several Process Access events, indicating that parts of Discord are interacting or accessing different resources. This could be standard operation as Discord loads its modules.\n\nI notice some Image Load tasks for Discord.exe and ffmpeg.dll. Ffmpeg is commonly used for video processing, so this aligns with Discord's functionality. Not a red flag here.\n\nThere are Pipe Created events repeatedly. Pipes in Windows are often used for inter-process communication. Since Discord is a complex application, it might create multiple pipes to communicate between different components or processes. This doesn't seem unusual unless the number is exceptionally high, which isn't the case here.\n\nThen there are two reg.exe commands executed. These look like they're adding registry entries under HKCU\\Software\\Classes for Discord and its default icon. This makes sense if Discord is setting up protocol handlers or icons during installation or update. It's common for applications to modify the registry when setting up their integration with the system.\n\nPutting it all together, these events cover launching Discord, accessing files, loading necessary modules, creating communication pipes, and registering itself in the Windows registry. None of these actions are outside normal behavior for a running Discord instance. There's no indication of unusual access patterns, failed processes, or writes to unexpected locations that would raise security concerns.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't show any signs of malicious activity. It all aligns with how Discord typically operates during startup and runtime.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal operations of the Discord application starting up and accessing its components.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events. The first thing I notice is that they're all related to Discord.exe and reg.exe processes on a Windows system. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event shows reg.exe being used to modify the registry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. That's interesting because modifying the registry can indicate malicious activity, like setting up persistence mechanisms or altering system behavior. The command line includes Discord's path and some parameters, so it might be legitimate, but it's worth looking into.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where Discord.exe accesses processes, connects to networks, performs DNS queries, and interacts with files. These could be normal operations for a Discord client, especially if it's trying to connect to servers or download resources.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned about the repeated NetworkConnect events from Discord.exe. While some connections are expected, too many might suggest data exfiltration or communication with unauthorized servers. Also, the DnsQuery events could indicate attempts to resolve malicious domains.\n\nThere's a FileExecutableDetected event for Google.Widevine.CDM.dll being executed by Discord.exe. This file is related to digital rights management, but if it's unexpected, it might be suspicious. It could be part of legitimate operations or potentially unwanted software.\n\nThe combination of registry modification and multiple network activities raises flags. Malware often uses these techniques: creating persistence via the registry, establishing network connections for command and control, and dropping files like DLLs to execute malicious code.\n\nGiven all these points, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because it shows behavior that could indicate malicious activity beyond normal Discord operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes registry modification by reg.exe and multiple network connections by Discord.exe, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object.\n\nFirst off, all these events are related to the Discord.exe process. That makes sense because Discord is a communication platform that often connects to servers and handles various network activities. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few events mention \"Network connection detected (rule: NetworkConnect)\". I see this repeated six times. Since Discord is an app that requires constant internet connectivity, these events are probably normal. It's just the application establishing or maintaining connections, which isn't unusual.\n\nThen there's an event where the task is \"Process terminated (rule: ProcessTerminate)\". That could be interesting because processes terminating can happen for different reasons. However, since it's Discord.exe, maybe it's just closing normally when the user exits the app or a crash occurs. But without more context, I can't say for sure if this is malicious.\n\nNext, there's an event about \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". This catches my attention because writing to the registry is something that legitimate software does during installation or configuration, but it's also a common tactic for malware to modify system settings. However, again, since this is Discord, which might be updating its configuration upon launch or some event, this could be normal.\n\nLooking at all these events together, I notice that most are standard operations for Discord. The network connections and registry writes don't stand out as malicious on their own. Plus, there's a lot of repetition with the same process and similar activities, which suggests routine behavior rather than something suspicious.\n\nI should also consider if the combination of events is unusual. For instance, multiple network connections could indicate data transfer, but again, this is normal for an application like Discord. The process termination might be part of the app's lifecycle, especially if it's crashing or being closed properly.\n\nThere's no indication in any of these events of failed attempts, access to sensitive files, unusual registry keys, or other red flags that would raise suspicions. All activities point towards standard operations expected from a running Discord instance.\n\nIn conclusion, while some individual events might look interesting in isolation, when viewed as a whole batch, they don't indicate any malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch isn't particularly relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal activities of the Discord.exe process, including network connections and registry modifications, which do not indicate suspicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
