{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. The user provided multiple JSONL entries, each representing an event on a system. My task is to analyze all these events together and decide whether they warrant further investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of the events involve powershell.exe. This immediately raises my suspicion because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The first few events show powershell.exe being launched with specific command-line arguments. Looking closely, the command line includes a script that uses findstr to search for \"pass\" in various file types like .xml, .doc, .txt, and .xls. This seems suspicious because it appears to be searching for sensitive information or credentials.\n\nAnother point of interest is the repeated occurrence of the same PowerShell command being executed multiple times across different events. This repetition could indicate that an attacker is running a script in a loop or trying different approaches to achieve their goal. Additionally, there are file creation events where temporary PowerShell scripts are being written to the filesystem. These temporary files might be used to execute malicious code or store data exfiltrated from the system.\n\nThere are also several ImageLoad and RegistryEvent tasks logged by powershell.exe. The loading of specific DLLs could be part of normal operation, but some of these paths, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, relate to Windows Defender components. It's unusual for PowerShell scripts to interact directly with antivirus components unless they're attempting to evade detection or disable security features.\n\nLooking at the other processes mentioned, such as OfficeClickToRun.exe performing a DNS query might be normal, but when combined with the powershell activity, it could indicate a broader campaign where multiple tools are being used. Similarly, events from chrome.exe showing registry modifications might not seem suspicious on their own but could be part of a larger pattern if they're linked to the powershell activities.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that some events have \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks under powershell.exe. These often indicate that PowerShell is initializing or shutting down, which can sometimes correlate with script execution or termination. The repeated occurrence suggests ongoing activity, possibly indicating a prolonged session or multiple script runs.\n\nThe fact that there are several registry modifications across different processes, including Calculator.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe, might not be directly malicious, but when combined with the powershell activities, they could hint at persistence mechanisms or configuration changes to maintain access.\n\nIn summary, while some events like Chrome's registry writes might seem benign, the extensive use of powershell.exe with specific command-line arguments that search for sensitive data and the creation of temporary files suggests potential malicious activity. The repetition of similar commands and interactions with system protection components further support this suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe executing a script searching for sensitive terms, which may indicate data exfiltration or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few lines, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe making DNS queries and loading system files like amsi.dll. That seems normal since Chrome is a common application accessing resources. \n\nThen I see events from winlogbeat.exe creating files in its data directory. This also appears routine as log beaters often write logs or configuration files.\n\nNext, powershell.exe creates some files named objeto_logico.txt and estrutura_ativo.txt. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. I need to check if these file creations are part of normal operations or if they're being used for something suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes scheduled tasks using schtasks. The command line shows it's removing specific tasks related to OnLogon and OnStartup. Deleting system tasks can be risky because it might disrupt normal system operations, but sometimes admins do this. However, the exact task names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" seem generic, so it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nThere are multiple schtasks.exe processes being created and deleted. This could indicate an attempt to cover tracks by removing scheduled tasks that might be monitoring or executing other commands. It's a bit concerning because deleting system tasks can allow persistence mechanisms to be removed, but without knowing the original tasks' purpose, it's hard to judge.\n\nThen there are events where WMIC.exe is used to delete processes. The command \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\" stands out because Notepad is a common application. Deleting it could be part of legitimate administration or might be trying to terminate something malicious. However, using WMIC for such operations is more typical in scripts and can sometimes be a vector for attacks.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, there's a mix of normal activities like browser processes and log file handling, along with potentially suspicious actions such as deleting system tasks and processes via cmd.exe and WMIC. The use of powershell.exe creating files and accessing processes is particularly notable because PowerShell is often used in attacks.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of events, especially the deletion of scheduled tasks and processes, along with file creations by PowerShell, could indicate malicious activity. However, without more context or specific indicators of compromise (IoCs), it's hard to be certain. My confidence is around 0.7 because there are multiple red flags but not enough concrete evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes events indicative of potential malicious activity, such as file creation by PowerShell and deletion of system tasks via cmd.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where processes like cmd.exe and conhost.exe are setting registry values. Registry modifications can be part of malicious activities because attackers often tweak system settings to maintain persistence or elevate privileges. The repeated use of these commands might indicate an attempt to change configurations or install something persistently.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed, which usually retrieves user information. While benign on its own, it could be part of reconnaissance to gather system details for later attacks.\n\nPowershell.exe appears several times with different tasksâ€”accessed, creating processes, and setting registry values. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. The command-line details in some entries look obfuscated or unusual, which raises suspicions. For example, the command line \"powershell.exe & {}\" seems odd and might be part of an attempt to run arbitrary code or evade detection.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process that deletes files in the Temp directory. Deleting temporary files could be part of cleaning up after malicious activities to remove traces of previous actions, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nSome entries have no file information, but others show deletions of specific files like \"tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe\". This suggests that malicious files were created and then removed, possibly as part of an attempt to cover tracks or remove unnecessary evidence after completing a task.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of registry modifications, powershell executions with potentially suspicious command lines, file deletions, and repeated use of tools like cmd.exe and conhost.exe points towards possible malicious activity. The events don't definitively prove an attack but show behaviors that are often associated with cyber threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry modifications, powershell executions, and file deletions suggest potential malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice several events related to `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command line arguments are often obfuscated or empty (`& {}`), which can be a red flag. These events include various tasks like Process Create, Image Load, Registry value sets, and others.\n\nLooking at the tasks:\n- \"Process Create\" indicates that PowerShell is starting.\n- Multiple \"Image loaded\" tasks show DLLs being loaded, which is normal but could also hint at malicious activity if unexpected.\n- \"Registry value set\" events might be trying to modify system configurations or create persistence points.\n\nThere are also multiple instances of `whoami.exe` being executed. While `whoami` is a legitimate command to check user information, repeated executions without clear purpose could indicate reconnaissance or credential gathering.\n\nOther processes like `RuntimeBroker.exe`, `notepad.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are running, but they're common system processes unless there's unusual behavior associated with them. In this case, their tasks don't seem out of the ordinary.\n\nConsidering the combination:\n- The repeated use of PowerShell with potentially suspicious command lines.\n- Multiple process creations for both PowerShell and whoami.exe might suggest scripting or automated activity, possibly malicious in nature.\n- Registry modifications could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nI'm concerned because these activities collectively don't seem to align with normal user behavior. They could be signs of script execution, lateral movement, or data exfiltration attempts. The confidence level is high due to the volume and types of events observed.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines and activity, including registry modifications and process creations, along with repeated whoami.exe executions may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down event by event.\n\nFirst up is Calculator.exe loading an image. That's common; most users open the calculator regularly, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext is svchost.exe modifying a registry value. Svchost is a known legitimate process, often used by services. Registry changes are normal for it, especially during updates or configuration changes. Not a red flag.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an agent used for log management, so it's expected to create files in its data directory. The path seems standard too, so nothing unusual here.\n\nPowershell.exe accessing a process might raise eyebrows because PowerShell can be abused by attackers. However, the event doesn't show any malicious activity like code execution or file creation. It just accessed another process, which could be legitimate if it's part of system administration tasks.\n\nNow, looking at chrome.exe events: three DNS queries and two network connections. Browsers do this all the time as they load pages. The repeated DNS queries might be for multiple sites, but without context on the actual domains, it's hard to say. The network connections are standard too, especially if Chrome is handling several tabs or extensions.\n\nPutting it all together: Calculator, svchost, winlogbeat, and Chrome events are all normal user activities. The only potential concern is powershell.exe, but without more context, it's tough to label it as malicious. Since there's no clear indication of suspicious behavior across the logs, I'd classify this batch as not interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal user activities such as using Calculator.exe, svchost.exe performing legitimate registry operations, winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files, and Chrome.exe making DNS queries and network connections. There is no indication of malicious behavior or unusual activity that would warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
