{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm going to go through each one and see if anything stands out as potentially malicious or interesting for investigation.\n\nStarting with the first four events: they all show \"chrome.exe\" making network connections. While Chrome does handle multiple tabs and extensions that might connect to the internet, repeated network connections could be suspicious, especially if they're unusual for the user's activity. But on their own, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, there's a process named \"whoami.exe\". This is a standard system tool used to display user information. However, when combined with command-line arguments or executed in an unexpected way, it could be a sign of something malicious trying to gather information about the system.\n\nThen, I see multiple instances where powershell.exe is being run with specific command lines. Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers for various tasks because it's legitimate and widely available. Looking at the command line details, there are XOR operations happening on some plaintext data. The code seems to be encoding the text using a simple substitution cipher (XOR) and then sending it via an HTTP POST request to example.com.\n\nBreaking down this script: the plaintext includes a \"Path\" followed by \"C:\\Users\\victim\". This looks like an attempt to exfiltrate information, possibly stealing paths or file locations. The encoding with XOR is basic but could be an attempt to obfuscate data being sent over the network. Additionally, there are multiple calls to powershell.exe with this script, which might indicate a script that's trying to run multiple times or part of a larger campaign.\n\nAlso notable are the events where files are created and then deleted in the Temp directory. This is common for malicious activities because it leaves less trace on the system. The file \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_j0wb0i2i.xpe.ps1\" being created and then immediately deleted suggests an attempt to bypass certain script execution policies or to not leave evidence behind.\n\nLooking at the process access, image load events, these are typical for running scripts and loading necessary components. But again, when combined with the other activities, it raises suspicion.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated network connections from Chrome could be normal, but the powershell.exe activity with XOR encoding and file operations is more concerning. The script's intent to send data over the network, especially including a path that references \"C:\\Users\\victim\", suggests possible exfiltration of sensitive information. Additionally, the use of Powershell for such activities aligns with common attack vectors.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because there are multiple red flags: unusual powershell script behavior, encoding data for transmission, and file operations that could indicate malicious activity. The confidence is around 0.85 because while some elements might be benign, the combination points to potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple powershell.exe instances running suspicious scripts with XOR encoding and network communication attempts, along with file creation\/deletion in Temp directory. These activities suggest potential malicious behavior such as data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is running scripts. The command lines show that it's encoding some plaintext with XOR encryption using a key, then sending data via POST to example.com. That's concerning because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, and the obfuscation technique suggests an attempt to hide data being exfiltrated.\n\nNext, there are several file-related events. Powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. While these might seem normal, I'm thinking if they're part of legitimate processes or if they could be indicators of something else. Also, the creation of a specific file in the StartupProfileData folder is worth notingâ€”it might be a persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking at process events, powershell.exe accessing other processes and modifying registry values stands out. Registry changes can indicate installation of malware or configuration changes for persistence. The same goes for other processes like conhost.exe and svchost.exe making registry modifications, which are common in malicious activities to hide traces.\n\nThere's also a lot of activity from chrome.exe, including pipe creation and multiple registry writes. While Chrome is a legitimate application, unusual process interactions could be red flags if they're part of an attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of powershell scripts with XOR encryption sending data, file creations in suspicious locations, and multiple processes modifying system configurations points towards potential malicious behavior. The repeated attempts to hide data and modify system settings are strong indicators that this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with xor encryption and data exfiltration attempts, along with suspicious file creations and registry modifications indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are from chrome.exe setting registry values multiple times. That seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the Windows Registry for settings and extensions. But then there are several entries from powershell.exe doing different things.\n\nOne event shows Powershell executing a command to remove a file using Remove-Item, which is a common script command. There's also a series of events where Powershell is removing various files in different paths. The commands look pretty similar but target different file locations. This repetition makes me think that maybe the same script is running multiple times or trying to clean up after itself.\n\nAdditionally, some entries mention tasks like ImageLoad and FileCreate, which are typical for processes loading libraries and creating files. However, the combination of creating temporary files and deleting specific scripts could be a red flag. The fact that these deletions are happening via Powershell commands might indicate script execution, possibly malicious.\n\nMoreover, I notice that some events under powershell.exe mention Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks, which can be part of normal script execution but might also be used in more complex attacks to hide activity or establish persistence.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual actions like registry writes by Chrome and Powershell commands aren't necessarily malicious on their own, the repeated attempts to delete files through Powershell across multiple paths might suggest a larger pattern. It could be an attempt to remove traces of previous activities, which is often seen in malware behavior to avoid detection.\n\nTherefore, this batch seems relevant for further investigation because it combines normal and potentially suspicious behaviors that together could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple Powershell processes attempting to delete files across different paths suggest potential script execution or cleanup activities, possibly indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few events involve powershell.exe executing commands like removing a file and accessing the process. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially when it comes to deleting files which could be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of whoami.exe being run. While this command is legitimate and often used to check user permissions, repeated use without a clear purpose might indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nThen, I notice several Registry value sets by both powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, allowing attackers to maintain access over time. This behavior is concerning because it can lead to persistent backdoor access.\n\nThere are also process creations with sc.exe, which is used to manage services. The commands 'sc.exe stop objeto_temporario' and 'sc.exe delete objeto_principal' suggest that the attacker might be disabling or deleting services. This could disrupt normal operations or remove competing malware, but it's a suspicious action in the context of an investigation.\n\nLooking at conhost.exe being involved in registry events, I'm cautious because conhost is a legitimate Windows process but can sometimes be abused to host malicious content or as part of attack chains.\n\nThroughout the logs, there are multiple access and image load events from powershell.exe. This could indicate it's executing scripts or loading modules, which might be part of a larger attack vector. The creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file '__PSScriptPolicyTest_14c001yd.l3m.ps1' is particularly telling. This seems like an attempt to execute arbitrary code without user consent, potentially indicating malicious scripting activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of deleting files, modifying the registry, stopping and deleting services, and creating\/deleting temporary PowerShell scripts points towards possible unauthorized system modifications or attack activities. These actions don't seem to be part of normal user behavior and could indicate an ongoing or attempted breach.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activity, including file deletions, registry modifications, service management commands, and PowerShell script execution.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I see a process named winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That seems normal because it's likely the beat responsible for logging. Then there are multiple entries from powershell.exe with command lines that seem suspicious. The same command line appears several times, which might indicate repeated attempts to execute the same script. This repetition could be a sign of automation or persistence.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, most are 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which I know are common in PowerShell events but could also be part of malicious activities trying to stay undetected. There's also a file creation by powershell.exe, followed by deleting that same file. This create-delete pattern is often used by attackers to clean up traces of their activity.\n\nThere's an event where whoami.exe was run. That's a common tool for gathering system information, which could be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation. Additionally, there are registry value sets and image loads from various DLLs, which might not be suspicious on their own but combined with other activities could raise flags.\n\nThe process also creates a temporary script file and then deletes it. This is concerning because such files can be used to execute malicious scripts without leaving long traces. The repeated use of the same command line in powershell.exe suggests an automated process, possibly part of a botnet or a persistence mechanism.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple signs of potentially malicious behavior: repeated PowerShell commands, file creation and deletion, registry modifications, and using whoami.exe. These activities don't seem to be normal user behavior and could indicate an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including repeated powershell.exe executions with potentially malicious commands, file creation\/deletion patterns, registry modifications, and use of whoami.exe.

Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple PowerShell.exe processes with command lines removing a log file in the TEMP directory. That might be suspicious because attackers often clean up logs after malicious activities. But then again, legitimate scripts might do that too, so I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nNext, several events show the loading of various DLLs by PowerShell. This is normal for scripts and isn't inherently bad. However, unusual DLL loads could be a red flag, but here they seem standard system files.\n\nI notice some file creation events in the TEMP directory with random filenames like __PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1. Creating temporary script files is common, but without seeing their content, it's hard to say if they're malicious. But combined with other PowerShell activities, this could be a sign of scripting execution.\n\nThere are events from whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is usually benign and used for legitimate purposes like checking user information or permissions. It doesn't seem concerning here unless it's part of a larger sequence of actions.\n\nA winlogbeat.exe process creating a configuration file is normal if that's part of log management software running on the system. No issues spotted there.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated PowerShell activity with attempts to remove logs and create temporary files might indicate someone trying to hide their tracks or execute arbitrary code. The use of powershell.exe command lines without clear legitimate context adds some concern. However, each individual action isn't necessarily malicious, but the combination could be a sign of potential compromise.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because while some activities are normal, others like removing log files and creating temp scripts might warrant further investigation to ensure there's no underlying malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes with command-line arguments attempting to remove a log file and create temporary script files.

I'm seeing a lot of process activity here, mostly from powershell.exe and whoami.exe.\n\nFirst off, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessed with the task \"ProcessAccess\". Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it has scripting capabilities, so repeated access might be suspicious. But sometimes it's also used legitimately, like for system administration tasks.\n\nThen I notice a couple of Process Create events for whoami.exe. Whoami is typically used to check user permissions or get environment info, which can be part of reconnaissance. However, seeing it multiple times could indicate an attacker trying to gather information about the system.\n\nLooking further down, there's a FileCreate event from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml file. That seems normal if it's related to log management software like WinlogBeat. It doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nI'm also noting that most of these events don't involve files being accessed or modified beyond the initial ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent for powershell.exe. Without seeing more indicators like changes in file content, network connections, or deletion of logs, it's hard to say if something malicious is happening.\n\nSo while there are some activities that could be red flags, they aren't enough evidence on their own. It might just be legitimate system activity or part of an automated process.
