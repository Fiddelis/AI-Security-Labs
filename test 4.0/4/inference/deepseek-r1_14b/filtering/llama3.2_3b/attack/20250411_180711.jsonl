{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the first two events: they're both from chrome.exe with network connection detected. That seems normal because Chrome often makes network connections, especially if you're browsing the web. So nothing suspicious there.\n\nMoving on to the third event: this is PowerShell being executed. The command line looks a bit complex. It's base64 encoded or something? Wait, no, I see it's using XOR with a key. The script is getting some plaintext data which includes \"Path\" and a file path like C:\\Users\\victim\\. Then it encrypts it by XORing each byte with the key and sends it via HTTP POST to example.com. That catches my attention because using XOR for encryption isn't very sophisticated, but more importantly, sending sensitive information over the network without proper justification could be malicious.\n\nNext events: there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs. That's typical when PowerShell runs scripts or executes commands—it loads necessary components. Nothing unusual here on its own.\n\nThen, a FileCreate event creates a temporary .ps1 file in the user's AppData folder. Temporary script files can be part of legitimate operations, but combined with the previous activity, it might indicate something suspicious, like creating a persistent backdoor or malicious script.\n\nAnother PipeCreated event from PowerShell follows. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, so that could be part of normal operation, but again, in combination with other events, it's worth noting.\n\nLooking at events 9 and 10: these show the same complex command line as before, which suggests repeated attempts to execute this script. The fact that it's being run multiple times increases the suspicion.\n\nPutting it all together: a PowerShell process is executing scripts that encode data and send it over the network. This could be part of data exfiltration, especially since the XOR encryption might be an attempt to hide the data. The temporary file creation and repeated attempts also point towards potential malicious activity. While some actions are normal for PowerShell, the combination of these events—network connections, encoding data, multiple executions—is a red flag.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is definitely malicious because sometimes scripts can have legitimate reasons for such behavior, but given that it's XOR encryption without any clear purpose and targeting an external domain (example.com), which isn't a known legitimate service in this context, it's more likely to be suspicious. \n\nSo, I think the batch should be classified as interesting because there are multiple indicators of potential malicious activity across all events.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit suspicious behavior including data encoding and network communication, which may indicate malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, most of the events are from powershell.exe processes. The command lines show that they're encoding plaintext with XOR using a simple key, then sending it via POST to example.com. This looks suspicious because using XOR cipher is basic and often used in malicious scripts. Sending data over the internet might be part of exfiltration.\n\nThe 'winlog' field varies between 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Engine Lifecycle', and others. The fact that some are related to service point managers adjusting settings like Expect100Continue suggests they're trying to manipulate HTTP requests, possibly to avoid detection or ensure certain behaviors from the server.\n\nLooking at all events, there are multiple instances of the same powershell command being executed, which indicates repeated attempts. This repetition could be part of a script running in a loop, which is often a sign of malicious activity trying different things or retrying actions.\n\nThe only non-powershell event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file, and another from svchost.exe modifying the registry. While these might seem benign, the combination with the other events could be concerning. Svchost.exe is commonly used by malware to hide processes, so an unusual registry change could be setting up persistence or privileges.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated execution of powershell scripts encoding and sending data, potential HTTP manipulation, and a process from svchost making registry changes. These factors suggest possible malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or establishing backdoors. The confidence is high because the pattern aligns with common attack techniques.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity encoding and sending data over HTTP, possibly indicating data exfiltration or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this batch of system log events and figure out whether they're interesting or not. I'm going to go through each event one by one, see what's happening, and then look for any patterns or red flags that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nFirst up is the Calculator.exe process loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal; Calculator probably needs some DLLs to run. Next, there's a powershell.exe accessing something via ProcessAccess. PowerShell is commonly used both legitimately and for attacks, so I'll keep an eye on what it does here.\n\nThen, chrome.exe sets a registry value. Browsers do that all the time for settings, so nothing suspicious there. Chrome also loads amsi.dll, which is related to antivirus. That's standard behavior as well.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file in its directory—that makes sense if it's just setting up or updating configuration files. Moving on, another powershell.exe process accessed again, and then one with a command line that tries to remove a specific .bat file. The path looks a bit long and maybe obfuscated, but not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the command lines, they're using Remove-Item to delete files in different paths. The fact that it's removing batch scripts from various locations could be concerning. These could be malicious scripts being deleted to cover tracks or just legitimate cleanup. But considering the number of similar events, maybe there's a pattern.\n\nThere are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessing and loading various DLLs, which might be normal if PowerShell is running scripts that require those libraries. However, the repeated file deletions with similar command lines make me think—maybe this is part of an attack chain where malicious scripts are being executed and then deleted to avoid detection.\n\nThe last few events have 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks, which might be related to PowerShell's operation but could also indicate some script activity that's trying to stay under the radar.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with specific deletion commands across different paths is a bit worrying. It looks like someone or something is cleaning up after itself, possibly deleting malicious scripts to prevent them from being detected. The combination of multiple deletions and process activities could indicate an attempt at persistence or covering tracks, which would be a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if these actions are part of a legitimate script cleanup or actual malicious behavior, but the volume and specific nature of the events raise my concern. So, I'll classify this batch as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes are observed accessing system components and deleting files across various paths, which may indicate potential malicious activity or attempts to remove traces of prior actions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is loading images and creating files. Powershell can be legitimate but also a red flag if it's doing unusual things. For example, the first entry loads MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which seems okay because Defender uses that file. But then, there's a file created in AppData under PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. I'm not sure why powershell would create something there; maybe it's related to script execution.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is being run twice. That's a common command for getting user information. Not inherently bad, but seeing it multiple times might be suspicious if other indicators are present. Similarly, cmd.exe runs some commands like deleting files in the temp directory and running sc.exe to stop a service named 'objeto_temporario'. The deletion of files without a clear reason could indicate someone trying to cover their tracks.\n\nLooking at services.exe accessing the registry – that's normal for services, so I'm not too worried about that unless there are other signs. Another cmd.exe runs a command in \/c mode, which usually means it's executing a single command and then terminating. The exact command is 'del \/A:H %%temp%%\\tarefa_logico.txt >nul 2>&1' – so deleting a file with specific attributes. If that file was created earlier by another process, this could be part of an automated script or malicious activity.\n\nThe powershell.exe entries continue with image loading and creating a temporary .ps1 script in the temp folder. Creating scripts on the fly can be a sign of scripting attacks or persistence mechanisms. The fact that multiple powershell processes are interacting with different files and registry entries suggests potential lateral movement or setup for further actions.\n\nI'm also noticing several process creations (Process Create events) and accesses (Process Access). While these could be normal, the combination with other activities like file creation, registry changes, and deletions might indicate malicious behavior. For example, if an attacker is using powershell to execute commands, they might leave behind logs of created processes and files.\n\nThe confidence level here is moderate because while some activities are concerning on their own (like deleting temp files and creating scripts), there's not a clear indication of malicious intent without more context. However, the volume of these events involving potentially high-risk tools like powershell.exe and cmd.exe for deletion suggests possible investigation is needed.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe loading images, creating files, and accessing registry values. The creation of a PowerShell script in the temp directory, along with deletions by cmd.exe and process creations involving whoami.exe and sc.exe, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first event: it's from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal since it's probably part of the log shipping process.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is running scripts with \"& {}\" and other commands. The tasks include Provider Lifecycle, which I know can be common when PowerShell starts up or runs certain modules.\n\nI notice several instances where powershell.exe is accessing files and registry values. For example, creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory might be part of initializing user-specific settings. Also, there's an attempt to remove a log file in TEMP, which could be cleaning up traces.\n\nThere are events where conhost.exe interacts with the registry—conhost is often used by PowerShell for console applications, so that's not too unusual.\n\nThe event with whoami.exe running is straightforward; it's just getting user information, which isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are more file creations and process accesses. The creation of a script in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest might be part of testing script execution policies. This could be either normal administrative activity or possibly something else, but without context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe repeated attempts to remove key.log from TEMP with different command lines are concerning. It seems like an attempt to delete log files that might contain sensitive information. The fact that this is happening multiple times and through PowerShell suggests possible malicious behavior, as attackers often clean up logs after activity.\n\nLooking at the image loads for DLLs like mscorlib.ni.dll and MpOAV.dll—these are standard system libraries and antivirus components, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated deletions of key.log stand out. It's a common tactic in attacks to remove log files to cover tracks. The combination of multiple PowerShell instances trying to delete the same file and the command lines used might indicate automated malicious activity or an attempt to obscure previous actions.\n\nWhile some events could be normal admin tasks, the frequency and nature of these deletions raise red flags. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe attempting to delete a log file in TEMP directory, which may indicate an attempt to cover tracks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event has a process named powershell.exe with a command line that removes a log file in the TEMP directory. This seems suspicious because deleting logs could be an attempt to cover tracks. Then, there's another event where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That might be normal since Defender uses PowerShell for some tasks.\n\nNext, I see several events of powershell.exe creating files in various paths, including the TEMP directory. Creating temporary files is common, but combined with previous deletions, it raises a flag. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe accesses processes and writes to the registry, which can be part of legitimate operations but might also indicate malicious activity.\n\nThere's an event where whoami.exe runs. This is usually harmless because it just returns user information, so I don't think this is concerning on its own. However, since it's paired with powershell.exe, it could be part of a script to gather more info.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where powershell.exe deletes and then recreates files in the TEMP directory. This pattern—delete and recreate—could indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies or clean up evidence after executing malicious commands. Additionally, several \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks from powershell.exe might be part of a script's cleanup process.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that some events don't have associated files, which could mean the actions are more about registry modifications or other in-memory activities, common in malware to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated deletions and creations by powershell.exe, combined with registry changes and process access. These behaviors suggest potential malicious activity, like a script trying to erase logs to hide its tracks or installing something persistently.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes showing file deletions, creations, and registry modifications indicative of possible malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, I'm given a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a system. My job is to analyze all these together and decide if the entire batch should be looked into further.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that there are processes being created or accessed. The process names alternate between 'whoami.exe' and 'powershell.exe'. Each of these seems to have specific actions associated with them in the winlog field.\n\nStarting with the first event: it's a Process Create task for whoami.exe, which is typically a legitimate system utility used to display information about the current user. It's not inherently malicious, but it depends on how and when it's used.\n\nThe second and third events involve powershell.exe being accessed via a ProcessAccess rule. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both for good and for bad purposes. However, just accessing it doesn't necessarily mean something nefarious is happening. It could be part of normal system administration tasks or script execution.\n\nContinuing through the events, I notice a pattern: whoami.exe being created multiple times interspersed with powershell.exe accesses. This repetition makes me think about possible loops or scripts running in the background. Maybe someone is testing permissions or trying to gather information over time by repeatedly running these commands.\n\nBut wait, each whoami.exe creation event shows a specific command line argument pointing to \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\". That's the standard path on Windows systems, so nothing unusual there. Similarly, the powershell.exe accesses don't show any command-line arguments, which could have been a red flag if present.\n\nI also check for the presence of file events, but in all these entries, the 'file' field is None. So no files are being accessed or modified here, at least as per the given data.\n\nPutting this together: legitimate tools like whoami and PowerShell are being used, but the frequency might be worth considering. If a system normally doesn't run these commands very often, multiple executions could indicate someone probing the environment or testing access levels. However, without more context—like unusual times of day, failed attempts, or other correlated events—it's hard to say definitively.\n\nOn one hand, the repetition might suggest automated behavior, which could be part of a larger script or malicious activity. On the other hand, it might just be routine administrative tasks being performed by an IT professional.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because while individual events aren't alarming, the pattern raises some eyebrows. The confidence isn't super high because there's no clear indication of malicious intent yet, but it's definitely worth keeping an eye on for further correlation with other logs or behaviors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed and 'powershell.exe' accessed could indicate potential reconnaissance activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
