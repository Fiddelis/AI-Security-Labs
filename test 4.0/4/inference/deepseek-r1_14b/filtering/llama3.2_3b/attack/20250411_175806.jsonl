{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Each event is in JSONL format, so I'll go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows a process named cmd.exe executing a command-line argument that adds a registry entry using REG ADD. The specific path being set is C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe. This looks suspicious because it's modifying the Run key in the Windows registry, which often indicates malicious activity like creating persistence mechanisms for malware.\n\nThe second event is similar but uses reg.exe to add another registry entry pointing to C:\\Path\\pacote_temporario.exe. Again, this is a common tactic used by attackers to ensure their program runs at startup, so it raises an alert.\n\nThe third event shows reg.exe accessing the same registry key, which might be checking if the previous changes were successful or perhaps trying to modify it again. Either way, multiple attempts to alter the Run key could indicate malicious behavior.\n\nMoving on, there's a PowerShell process that created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\modulo_padrao.txt and another event where PowerShell accessed something (maybe reading a file). The creation of a file by PowerShell is concerning because it's often used to drop malicious scripts or tools. Additionally, the fact that this user might not be expected to run such commands adds to the suspicion.\n\nPutting all these together: cmd.exe and reg.exe being used to modify the registry for persistence, coupled with PowerShell activities, especially file creation, suggests a potential attack chain. The attackers are likely trying to establish persistence on the system, possibly dropping malicious files and ensuring they run at startup. This combination is definitely something that needs investigation as it indicates possible unauthorized access or malware activity.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as interesting because these actions don't typically occur in normal user activities. However, confidence isn't 100% without more context, but the pattern strongly suggests malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and PowerShell activity suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
