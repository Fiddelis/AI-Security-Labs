{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm looking at a batch of system log events that need to be analyzed for any potential malicious activity. The logs are in JSONL format, each line being a separate JSON object.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events one by one to understand what's happening on the system. \n\nStarting with the first two entries, both show processes named 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe', which loaded the 'urlmon.dll' file. These seem normal as they're standard Windows components used for URL handling.\n\nNext, I see 'svchost.exe' accessing a registry value. Svchost is a common system process, so this doesn't raise any red flags unless it's doing something unusual outside its typical operations, which isn't the case here.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed. Whoami is a legitimate tool used to display user information, so unless it's part of an exploit chain, this alone isn't concerning.\n\nThe event with 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe' also accessing the registry seems normal, as this process often interacts with the Windows shell and registry.\n\nLooking at 'powershell.exe', I know that PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by both admins and attackers. The entries show it being accessed or creating processes, but without any specific malicious command-line arguments mentioned, it's hard to say if it's suspicious. However, multiple accesses could indicate something more.\n\nMoving on, there are several 'cmd.exe' events with command lines that catch my attention. One instance runs \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\", which deletes the Notepad process. Another uses \"copy \/Y\" to overwrite an existing file in System32. The last cmd command is deleting a scheduled task with schtasks. These commands are concerning because they involve system-level operations like deleting processes and files, which can be indicators of malicious activity. For example, deleting Notepad.exe might be part of persistence mechanisms or attempts to remove traces.\n\nThe 'WMIC.exe' entries also stand out. WMIC is another tool that's often used for remote command execution and can be abused by attackers. The command lines here include deleting a process and accessing DLL files in different locations, which could indicate an attempt to load malicious code or hide activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple attempts to run 'whoami.exe' and access 'powershell.exe', which might suggest credential dumping or other administrative privileges escalation if combined with other actions.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the combination of deleting system processes (like notepad.exe), overwriting files in System32, using WMIC for deletion, and multiple PowerShell accesses raises significant red flags. These activities are often associated with malware attempting to establish persistence, delete evidence, or gain unauthorized access.\n\nTherefore, while individual events might not be suspicious on their own, the batch as a whole shows patterns that could indicate malicious behavior. The confidence level is high because several red flag actions are present across different processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activities such as deleting system files, overwriting executables, and using tools commonly associated with attacks (e.g., WMIC.exe, cmd.exe with suspicious commands). These actions could indicate a compromise or an attack in progress.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe are being created or accessed. Powershell is often used in scripting but can also be a red flag because it's commonly exploited for malicious activities. The command lines for these processes don't seem immediately suspicious—cmd.exe is just executing commands as usual.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe appears multiple times with different tasks, like accessing processes and files, loading images, and creating files. There’s an interesting pattern where a script file is created and then deleted almost right after: the creation of __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1 and its subsequent deletion could indicate some kind of script execution test or cleanup. Malware often deletes logs or traces to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the use of conhost.exe, which is a Windows process host. Sometimes, malicious scripts launch legitimate processes like this for obfuscation. Also, whoami.exe being executed might be part of credential-dumping activities or just system information gathering.\n\nLooking at file operations, powershell.exe writes to various files in different locations. The fact that it's creating and then deleting a script file in the Temp directory is concerning because it suggests some automated process or perhaps a test script. Additionally, the path C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp seems like a common spot for temporary files but can be used by malware too.\n\nThe events with Registry value sets could indicate changes to system configurations, which might be part of persistence mechanisms or modifying security settings. Powershell scripts are known for their ability to interact with the registry and file system effectively.\n\nI also see entries from winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files—this is likely a legitimate process since it's related to log management, so I don't think that's suspicious.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple powershell instances with varied activities, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and registry modifications. These could be signs of malicious activity like script execution tests, persistence attempts, or data exfiltration. The repeated use of powershell.exe is a red flag because it's a common tool for attackers. While some actions might be benign, the combination suggests potential foul play.\n\nHowever, without more context or indicators of compromise (like known malware signatures), it's hard to be certain. But given the volume and nature of these events, I would lean towards classifying this batch as interesting because it exhibits behavior that could indicate malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with varied activities, including file creation\/deletion in Temp directory and registry modifications, suggest potential malicious behavior or automated script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is about whoami.exe being executed. That seems normal because it's a common utility used to check user information. Not too suspicious on its own, but I should keep an eye out for other events related to this process.\n\nNext, there are several events involving powershell.exe. Each of them shows that the command line is running some sort of script with Test-Path commands checking for specific batch files. The paths seem a bit convoluted, like \"C:\\objeto_comum\\estrutura_base\\..\\\" and so on. That might be trying to check if certain files exist in parent directories. This could indicate legitimate file existence checks or something more nefarious.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, I see Provider Lifecycle, Process Create, Image Load, File Delete, Pipe Created, Engine Lifecycle, File Create, and Registry value set events. The combination of process creations with powershell.exe and multiple registry accesses might be a red flag. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities.\n\nThere's an event where a file was deleted: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1\". Deleting files, especially in temporary directories, might be part of cleaning up traces after executing some script. That could mean someone is trying to cover their tracks.\n\nAnother event shows the creation of a file in the StartupProfileData directory. This is where PowerShell stores profile data for non-interactive sessions. If an attacker is using this to drop malicious scripts or modify profiles, it could be problematic.\n\nI also notice multiple Process Create events with powershell.exe, each with different command lines. The variations might indicate attempts to execute different commands or payloads, possibly to bypass detection mechanisms by changing the script each time.\n\nThe use of Test-Path in these scripts is a bit concerning because attackers often check for files to determine if they're on a compromised system or to ensure certain conditions before executing malicious code. It's a common tactic in attack chains.\n\nAdditionally, there are File Create and Registry Event tasks. Modifying registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malware to run at startup or modify system configurations.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe processes with varying command lines, file deletions, checks for specific files, and modifications to the file system and registry suggest potential malicious activity. While not all these actions are inherently bad, the combination raises suspicion that an attacker might be using PowerShell to execute scripts, possibly for lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nThe confidence level is around 0.8 because while there are indicators of possible malicious behavior, some could be legitimate administrative tasks. However, the number and variety of events involving powershell.exe and file\/registry modifications make it more likely than not that this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with varied command lines, file deletions, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

That immediately raises some flags because PowerShell is often used by both legitimate administrators and attackers for various tasks. However, it's also commonly used in malicious activities like script execution and lateral movement within a network.\n\nLooking at the specific details:\n\n1. **Registry Activity**: There's an event where a registry value was set. This could be part of normal operations, but it might also indicate that some persistent configuration is being made on the system, which could be malicious.\n\n2. **Image Load Events**: Multiple events show that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs. While this isn't inherently suspicious, in the context of other activities, it might suggest that PowerShell is using these libraries to perform specific tasks, potentially malicious ones.\n\n3. **File Creation and Content Setting**: Several events involve creating files (like .bat scripts) and setting their content. The paths mentioned look unusual with names like \"elemento_ativo_script.bat\" or \"pacote_principal_script.bat\". These filenames don't seem standard and might be part of a script execution chain, which could be suspicious.\n\n4. **Command-Line Arguments**: The command lines in some events are using powershell.exe to execute scripts that create new items (files) and set their content to commands like \"dir\". This suggests that the system is being used to create batch files that might perform directory listings or other actions when executed. While directory listing isn't malicious on its own, it could be part of a larger attack strategy, such as mapping out the system's structure.\n\n5. **Process Access and Pipe Created**: There are events where processes accessed each other and pipes were created. This can indicate communication between different processes, which might be legitimate but also could be signs of command-and-control or lateral movement.\n\n6. **Provider and Engine Lifecycle Events**: These types of events often relate to service or driver activity. Combined with the other activities, it's worth monitoring as they can sometimes be indicators of malicious activity, especially if combined with other suspicious actions.\n\nConsidering all these points together: the repeated use of powershell.exe, creating new scripts, setting registry values, and loading specific DLLs—these behaviors could indicate that an attacker is using PowerShell to perform tasks such as persistence, lateral movement, or executing malicious scripts. While not every instance of these activities is malicious, the combination here raises enough concern to warrant further investigation.\n\nThe confidence level isn't extremely high because some of these actions can be part of legitimate admin tasks. However, given the repetitive pattern and the creation of unusual script files, it leans towards being suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe events show file creation and registry activity indicative of potential malicious scripting.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Most of them are PowerShell executions with exit codes based on file existence checks. These could be part of normal operations or scripts.\n\nThere's a File Delete event involving a PowerShell script test file. That stands out because deleting files can indicate malicious activity, but it might also be legitimate cleanup.\n\nI see some process creations and file operations from different executables. However, without more context on the user's behavior or known baseline, these actions seem routine.\n\nConsidering all events together, there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The high number of PowerShell checks for files doesn't suggest immediate harm, and the File Delete might be part of a script. Without additional anomalies, this batch isn't particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of PowerShell executions checking file existence, which could be legitimate.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with some command lines that check if specific files exist and exit accordingly. That seems a bit odd because why would PowerShell be checking for the existence of certain files in such a way? It could be part of a script to verify conditions, but it might also be a way to test if those files are present as part of some malicious activity.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe is accessing or deleting a temporary file. The path mentioned is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\something.ps1. Temporary files can be legitimate, but sometimes attackers use them to store scripts for execution. Also, the fact that it's being deleted might indicate an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe accessing various DLLs and other system files. That's not unusual on its own, but combined with the previous actions, it could mean that PowerShell is loading modules or trying to execute code with elevated privileges.\n\nLooking at the tasks, there are multiple Process Create events for both PowerShell and cmd.exe. The command line for cmd.exe is a bit concerning because it's using an IF EXIST statement to check for a file named objeto_logico.txt in the Temp directory. If the file exists, it exits with 0; else, 1. This could be part of some automated script checking system configurations or maybe trying to see if certain tools are present.\n\nThere are also several Registry value set events from powershell.exe. Modifying the registry can be normal for scripts, but it's something to monitor because malicious actors might use it to persistence their activities or change system settings.\n\nAdditionally, whoami.exe is being run a couple of times. While this is typically used to check user permissions and could be part of legitimate script execution, in some cases, attackers use it to gather information about the current user or system.\n\nPutting all these together, I'm noticing a pattern where multiple processes are being created, files are being accessed and deleted, scripts might be running, and there's interaction with both the file system and registry. This could indicate that an attacker is attempting to execute code, check for certain conditions, or perhaps even deploying malicious software.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell with command lines checking various paths and deleting temporary files raises red flags because attackers often use PowerShell for its built-in cmdlets and ability to run scripts. The deletion of the .ps1 file could be an attempt to clean up after execution or prevent analysis.\n\nThe combination of these events—process creation, file access\/deletion, registry modifications—is concerning. It suggests potential malicious activity rather than normal system operations, especially considering the repeated attempts and the specific paths being checked.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as INTERESTING because it shows signs of possible unauthorized system manipulation and could indicate a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with command lines checking file existence, deletion of temporary script files, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple events involve powershell.exe being executed. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. Each event shows the command line arguments, which are checking the existence of specific files using Test-Path in PowerShell scripts. This behavior might indicate an attempt to verify if certain files exist before proceeding with something else.\n\nLooking closer, the command lines reference various file paths that include \".cs\" and \".ps1\" files, which are C# and PowerShell script extensions. The presence of multiple checks for different files suggests a pattern where the attacker is ensuring specific scripts or components are present, possibly to confirm if they've been successfully deployed or if certain conditions are met.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" in some command lines. This script name sounds suspicious as it implies capturing keystrokes, which is a common tactic for keyloggers used in malware to steal sensitive information.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where PowerShell loads various DLLs and creates temporary files. The loading of different .NET framework components and the creation of a file in the Temporary directory (__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1) might be part of script injection or execution techniques to avoid detection.\n\nThe logs also show multiple instances where tasks are related to Provider Lifecycle, which is typical when services or components are being started or stopped. However, combined with the other behaviors, this could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious scripts at startup.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the repeated PowerShell executions, file existence checks, attempts to load external scripts, and creation of temporary files—it's highly likely that this batch indicates malicious activity. The combination suggests a potential attack where an adversary is checking for the presence of certain tools or files before executing them, possibly as part of a broader campaign.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious command lines checking file existence and attempting to load scripts related to keystroke capture.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is a PowerShell process checking if a script exists. The command line has some conditionals; it exits 0 if the file exists, else 1. That seems a bit odd because why check for a script? Maybe trying to run something malicious, but not sure yet.\n\nNext, another PowerShell event where a file was created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That location is non-standard and might be used for persistence. I'll note that as potentially suspicious.\n\nThen there's a registry value being set by PowerShell. Registry changes can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes for malicious activities. Definitely something to watch.\n\nA whoami.exe process is created. It's commonly used to get user information, which could be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation. If this runs without legitimate context, it might be a red flag.\n\nAnother event shows calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal because many apps load system DLLs, so maybe not too concerning on its own.\n\nSVCHOST setting registry values again. SVCHOST is often used by legitimate services, but sometimes malware can misuse it. Not sure yet if this is bad, but combined with other events, it might be worth looking into.\n\nCalculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again. Same as calc.exe; probably normal.\n\nWinlogbeat creating a file in its own directory. That's likely part of the data collection process and not malicious unless there's something odd about the path or timing.\n\nMultiple instances where whoami.exe is run without any apparent reason, which might indicate repeated attempts to gather user information.\n\nPowerShell running with some command-line arguments that include ls, get-childitem, and gci. These are common cmdlets for directory listings, but if combined with other activities like file creation or registry changes, it could be part of a larger script trying to map the system.\n\nSome events show PowerShell accessing processes or loading images. This is typical for scripts, but without context, hard to say. The file deletion event where a temp PowerShell script is deleted might indicate an attempt to remove evidence after execution.\n\nPutting all this together: there are multiple instances of PowerShell activities with conditional checks, registry modifications, repeated whoami.exe runs, and suspicious file operations. These behaviors could be part of a malicious payload trying to establish persistence, gather information, or delete traces. The combination suggests potential malicious intent, so the batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell activities including conditional file checks, registry modifications, repeated whoami.exe runs, and suspicious deletions, indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries that detail different system activities. Each line represents an event with process information, Windows log details, and file data.\n\nFirst, I notice that several events involve 'powershell.exe' as the process name. PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and script-based attacks because it's versatile and can execute code in various ways. The tasks associated with these powershell processes include creating files, setting registry values, and accessing processes. For example, one event shows a file being created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. That's a bit concerning because creating a file in the Startup folder can indicate persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother process involved is 'conhost.exe', which is often associated with running command-line tools. It's not inherently malicious, but when combined with other activities, it could raise suspicions. There's also an event from 'winlogbeat.exe' which creates a configuration file. WinlogBeat is typically used for log management, so that might be benign unless there's something unusual about how it's being used.\n\nLooking at the Windows log tasks: File creation and Registry events are common, but when these occur alongside powershell.exe, they can be indicators of malicious activity. For example, setting registry values could be part of creating a persistence mechanism or modifying system configurations to allow further access.\n\nI also see that some events have 'None' for file paths, which might mean the action didn't involve writing to a file, but it's hard to tell without more context. The fact that powershell.exe is accessing processes suggests possible process injection or lateral movement, which are red flags in security.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple instances of powershell.exe performing actions like creating files and modifying registry entries could be part of an attack chain. Even though each individual event might not be malicious on its own, the combination raises concerns about potential malicious activity, such as persistence, credential dumping, or lateral movement within a network.\n\nHowever, it's possible that these activities are legitimate. For instance, powershell.exe can be used for system administration tasks. But given the number of events and their nature, especially the file creation in a Startup folder and multiple Registry modifications, it seems more likely to be suspicious than not.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are several red flags when considering all the events together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file creation and registry modifications, along with other processes like conhost.exe, may indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or process injection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
