{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. So, I have a batch of events from system logs, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's a PowerShell process starting with a command that creates a new PSDrive. That caught my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command seems like it's trying to map a drive using the target's C$ share, which is common in remote attacks. This could be a sign of lateral movement.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where PowerShell loads images (ImageLoad rule). These are normal as part of PowerShell's operation, but when combined with other suspicious activities, they might indicate malicious behavior. The files being loaded don't seem immediately alarming on their own, but their frequency and the context of the other events make me cautious.\n\nThere's an event where a file is deleted (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1). Deleting temporary PowerShell scripts can be part of cleaning up after executing malicious code. This deletion might be to remove evidence or prevent analysis, which is a red flag for potential malware.\n\nAnother event involves cmd.exe with a command line that just has '\/c', which doesn't execute any command. That's odd because usually, you'd expect it to run something. The empty command could be part of process injection techniques or testing if the system is vulnerable without leaving much trace.\n\nMultiple events show registry value sets and process accesses. These actions can be used by attackers to maintain persistence or modify system configurations. Repeated modifications to the registry might indicate an attempt to create persistent backdoors or alter security settings.\n\nThe number of ProcessCreate events for PowerShell also stands out. Legitimate use would vary, but this volume might suggest a script running multiple times or some automated process that's not typical. It's a common tactic in attacks to spawn multiple instances to avoid detection or disrupt analysis.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows several red flags: unusual PowerShell commands, file deletions of temporary scripts, empty cmd.exe calls, and repeated registry modifications. While each event on its own might not be alarming, their combination suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence level is around 0.8 because while there are strong indicators, they could also be coincidental legitimate actions, but the patterns lean towards something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with unusual commands and file operations, including attempts to access remote drives and deletion of temporary scripts, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple events involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers. The first two entries show File Delete tasks on specific .ps1 files in the Temp directory. That's concerning because deleting script files might indicate an attempt to remove evidence or prevent execution.\n\nNext, there are several Image Load events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs. This is normal operation, but combined with other suspicious activities, it could be part of malicious behavior like lateral movement or payload execution.\n\nThen I notice multiple Process Create events for whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is typically used to check user privileges and might be harmless on its own, but repeated executions without a clear purpose could be an attempt to gather information about the system's configuration.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe command that runs 'netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off'. Disabling Windows Firewall is a common tactic in attacks to prevent detection or block outgoing communications. This action alone should raise flags as it can allow further malicious activities undetected.\n\nAdditionally, there are events from netsh.exe setting the firewall state off and multiple RegistryEvent tasks by svchost.exe. Svchost is often used by legitimate services but can also be exploited by malware to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms. The repeated registry changes could indicate an attacker trying to install backdoors or alter security settings.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several red flags: deletion of script files, disabling of firewall, and multiple process creations that don't seem necessary. These activities collectively suggest possible malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system's security.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events including file deletions by PowerShell, attempts to disable Windows Firewall, and registry modifications by svchost.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs. There are multiple entries where svchost.exe is involved in registry events and some PowerShell commands that look suspicious.\n\nFirst, the svchost.exe process is a common one in Windows, often used by legitimate services, but it can also be abused by malware. The repeated Registry modifications could indicate malicious activity since attackers often tweak system settings to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nThen there's the PowerShell activity. I see commands like creating a new PS drive and empty command lines. Empty command lines might mean obfuscation. Attackers sometimes use these to hide their actual intentions. The mix of Provider and Engine Lifecycle events suggests script execution, which is common in attacks using PowerShell for lateral movement or executing malicious scripts.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of registry changes and unusual PowerShell activity could be signs of an ongoing attack. The repetitive nature might be part of a campaign trying to stay under the radar. I'm confident this batch is interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of svchost.exe making registry changes and powershell.exe commands that may indicate malicious activity, such as potential lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at multiple JSONL entries here. Each event seems to be a process running PowerShell with the same command line.\n\nThe command line in each case checks if \"procdump.exe\" exists in a specific directory and then exits with 0 if it does, else exits with 1. That's interesting because procdump is often used for debugging processes, but in the context of cybersecurity, it can also be malicious if used to dump process memory or gain persistence.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field, most events have a task named \"Provider Lifecycle\" and one has \"Engine Lifecycle.\" These tasks are part of Windows event logging and usually indicate normal system operations. However, the repeated checking for procdump.exe is concerning because it could be an attempt to verify if certain tools are present, possibly for malicious activities like lateral movement or persistence.\n\nThe file field is None in all these events, which might mean that no files were directly accessed or modified during this process. But since it's a PowerShell command, the absence of file data doesn't necessarily rule out other malicious actions, such as registry modifications or network activity, which aren't captured here.\n\nConsidering the repetition of the same command across multiple events, it seems like an automated check being run several times. This could be part of an attack chain where the presence of procdump.exe is verified before executing further commands. Alternatively, it might be a legitimate process checking for tools, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe confidence level isn't too high because while the activity is unusual and potentially suspicious, there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior beyond the check itself. It could be a false positive or part of normal system operations, especially if procdump.exe is legitimately installed on the system.\n\nIn summary, the batch is interesting due to repeated checks for a tool often used maliciously, but without more data, it's hard to definitively classify as an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated PowerShell command checking for procdump.exe existence, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
