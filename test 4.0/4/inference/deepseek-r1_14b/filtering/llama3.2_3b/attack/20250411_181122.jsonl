{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the first event is running whoami.exe. That's a common command and probably just a user checking their permissions. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple powershell.exe processes. The command lines look like they're searching for keywords related to passwords in various file types. This could be part of legitimate auditing or it might indicate password harvesting. Definitely something to look into since PowerShell scripts can do a lot, both good and bad.\n\nThen, I see that the same PowerShell command is running multiple times with different tasks like Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle. Repeated executions of the same script might mean it's part of a loop or automated process, which could be malicious if it's trying to avoid detection by breaking into smaller actions.\n\nThere are file creation and deletion events for temporary .ps1 files. Creating a temp script and then deleting it can help evade some security measures because the malicious code isn't persisted on disk. This is a red flag as it's a common tactic in attacks.\n\nLooking at other processes, there's svchost.exe making registry changes. SvcHost is often used by legitimate services, but unauthorized changes could indicate malware installing persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations.\n\nAlso, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll seems normal, but combined with the other events, it might be part of a chain where tools are being checked or used for something more nefarious.\n\nOverall, multiple PowerShell instances running similar commands, file operations that try to avoid leaving traces, and svchost modifying the registry suggest possible malicious activity. It's definitely worth investigating because these could be signs of an attack in progress.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious commands, including password harvesting and file manipulation, along with system service changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this batch of events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, one per line. Each has a process, winlog, and file field. The goal is to analyze all together, not each individually.\n\nLooking at the first event: OfficeClickToRun.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal for apps needing network info. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command looking for 'pass' in various files. Using findstr and select-string with password pattern. That catches my attention because searching for passwords like that could be data theft or malicious activity. But I need to see the context of all events.\n\nThen, another event where PowerShell creates a file in StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Creating files in non-standard locations, especially under AppData, might indicate persistence mechanisms. Maybe setting up something to run at startup.\n\nChrome events follow: creating pipes, DNS queries, loading DLLs, and network connections. These seem normal for browser activity—amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender. So nothing suspicious here.\n\nMultiple Registry value sets from chrome.exe. Browsers do modify the registry for settings or extensions, so not unusual unless it's accessing sensitive areas.\n\nWinlogbeat creating a config file. That's expected if they're running ELK for logs. No issues here.\n\nThen there are several whoami.exe and cmd.exe commands. Whoami is usually benign, but the cmd.exe command deletes scheduled tasks with specific names. The task names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" seem arbitrary, possibly related to persistence or scheduled malicious activities. Deleting such tasks could be trying to remove monitoring tools or prevent execution.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command using schtasks to delete more tasks. Again, this is concerning if these tasks are legitimate but being removed.\n\nThere's a WMIC.exe process deleting notepad.exe processes. Using wmic for process deletion might be legitimate admin work, but it can also be used maliciously to kill legitimate processes or hide activity.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch has multiple instances of PowerShell commands searching for passwords, creating files in non-standard locations, and using cmd and schtasks to delete scheduled tasks. Additionally, there's a WMIC process deletion. These activities could indicate someone trying to escalate privileges, gather sensitive info, or install malware that needs persistence.\n\nSo overall, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior. The confidence isn't 100% because some actions like Chrome's Registry writes are normal, but the PowerShell and task deletions are red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious activities such as PowerShell commands searching for sensitive data, creation of files in non-standard locations, deletion of scheduled tasks, and use of WMIC.exe to delete processes. These actions may indicate potential malicious behavior or unauthorized system modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's see what each event shows.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and net.exe are being used with command lines that delete user accounts. For example, the command line for cmd.exe is \"\/c net user \/del \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\"\", which means it's deleting a user account named \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\". Similarly, there are other commands deleting different Admin accounts. That seems suspicious because deleting multiple user accounts could be part of an attack to remove evidence or disable accounts.\n\nThen, I notice that some events involve processes like sc.exe being used to delete services, like \"sc delete win32times\". Deleting system services might be another attempt to disrupt normal operations or remove traces of malicious activities.\n\nThere are also events where whoami.exe is run. While this command is often used just to check the current user, in the context of multiple deletions and other commands, it could indicate an attacker checking permissions or verifying their access level.\n\nLooking at the file paths, most don't point to anything suspicious except one event mentioning MpOAV.dll, which is related to Windows Defender. But since that's a legitimate file, I don't think that's concerning on its own.\n\nThe events are spread out over multiple processes and commands, but they all seem related to account deletions and service removals. This pattern could indicate someone trying to clean up after themselves, maybe removing accounts or services they created during an attack.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated deletion of user accounts and services using various tools suggests possible malicious activity aimed at erasing traces. However, without more context like timestamps or additional events showing other suspicious behavior (like lateral movement or data exfiltration), it's hard to be certain. Still, the combination is concerning enough to consider it interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes including cmd.exe, net.exe, and sc.exe are used to delete user accounts and services. This pattern suggests potential malicious activity aimed at erasing traces.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by parsing each event.\n\nThe first event shows cmd.exe deleting a file in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe. That's a red flag because executable files being deleted could indicate malicious activity, especially if it's trying to remove evidence.\n\nNext, there are several events involving whoami.exe and powershell.exe. Whoami is typically used to get user information, but the way it's called here might be suspicious if combined with other actions. Powershell is a common tool for attackers because it has built-in cmdlets that can do both legitimate and malicious tasks.\n\nLooking deeper into the powershell.exe events: there are process creations, accesses, and multiple image loads. Notably, there are file creation and deletion events involving temporary files in AppData\\Local\\Temp. This could indicate script execution or dropping malware components which are then deleted to clean up traces.\n\nThe repeated use of whoami.exe might be an attempt to gather system information or to elevate privileges. Also, the command lines with \"&\" look like they're chaining commands together, which is common in scripting and could be a sign of automated malicious activity.\n\nThe events related to registry value sets by powershell.exe and conhost.exe are also concerning. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure it runs on subsequent boot-ups or logins.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows multiple signs of potential恶意行为, including deletion of suspicious files, extensive use of PowerShell for potentially malicious tasks, repeated process creations with whoami.exe, and registry modifications. These activities could be indicators of an attack, such as credential dumping, persistence setup, or file deletion to cover tracks.\n\nI'm confident at 0.8 that this batch is interesting because while some events might not individually be suspicious, the combination suggests a possible malicious sequence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple potentially suspicious activities including file deletions, process creations involving whoami.exe and powershell.exe, registry modifications, and temporary file operations which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's see. I've got a batch of system log events to analyze as a cybersecurity expert. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. \n\nLooking at the first event: It's about 'calc.exe' loading an image from 'urlmon.dll'. Hmm, that seems normal because calc.exe is a standard Windows calculator and urlmon is part of Windows system files, handling URL processing.\n\nThe next event is similar but with 'Calculator.exe', which I assume is another name for the same process. Still, nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen there's an event from 'winlogbeat.exe' about creating a file in a user directory. Winlogbeat is likely a log management tool, so it's normal for it to create configuration files like '.winlogbeat.yml.new'.\n\nThe fourth event involves 'powershell.exe', which can be both legitimate and malicious. The task here is 'Process accessed', but without more details, it's hard to tell. However, powershell being monitored isn't unusual in itself.\n\nNext are a series of events from 'chrome.exe' related to DNS queries and network connections. These seem typical for a browser accessing websites, so nothing out of the ordinary there.\n\nConsidering all these events together: No single event stands out as malicious when looked at collectively. They cover normal user activity like using calculator, log management tool creating files, powershell usage (common in sysadmin tasks), and regular browser activity. There's no indication of unusual file accesses, multiple failed attempts, or known malicious process chains.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING\". The justification would be that all activities are within normal user behavior and system operations, with no signs of attack patterns or anomalies.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes such as calculator execution, file creation by a log management tool, PowerShell activity, and browser operations without any signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
