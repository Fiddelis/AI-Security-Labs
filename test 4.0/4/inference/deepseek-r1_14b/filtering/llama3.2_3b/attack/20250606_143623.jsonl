Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a process named 'whoami.exe' being created. That seems normal since it's often used to check user information. But then, powershell.exe is accessed and later creates a new service with a command line that looks suspicious. The command includes creating a service with specific paths, which could be a red flag because it might indicate setting up a backdoor or malicious activity.\n\nPowershell is known for being versatile but can also be misused for attacks. The script path mentioned \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum...\" doesn't look standard, and the fact that it's creating and then deleting a file in the Temp folder suggests an attempt to hide traces. That temporary PowerShell script creation and deletion is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nThere are several registry writes by services.exe, which could be changing system configurations or creating persistence mechanisms. Also, tarefa_logico.exe loading .NET DLLs might not be inherently bad, but combined with the other activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nSetup.exe creating files for msedge seems normal, so that's probably unrelated to any malicious activity. However, the overall pattern of powershell and service creation with unusual paths raises suspicions. The repeated registry modifications by services.exe also stand out as potentially harmful.\n\nConsidering all these events together, especially the powershell activities and the new service creation, it seems like there's a possible attempt at installing malware or unauthorized access. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious activity including PowerShell script execution with potentially malicious command lines, file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, and multiple registry modifications, indicating possible unauthorized access or malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm supposed to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. The user is a cybersecurity expert, so they're looking for signs of malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I notice that \"setup.exe\" is creating several files in the Microsoft Edge directory. That seems normal because setup.exe is typically used for installing software. The files like msedge.exe and pwahelper.exe are legitimate parts of the Edge browser, so no red flags there.\n\nThen there's activity from svchost.exe. I know svchost.exe is a common system process that can be associated with services. But sometimes it's used by malware to hide their activities. The logs show multiple registry events—values being set and objects added or deleted. That could indicate configuration changes, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nLooking further down, I see svchost.exe creating temporary files in the Windows Temp directory with APPX extensions. Those might be related to application updates or patches. However, sometimes malicious actors use such files for persistence or other activities. But again, these could just be legitimate update processes.\n\nThe last event is powershell.exe being executed with a restricted execution policy. The command writes \"Final result: 1\" to the host. Restricted policies are meant to prevent script execution, but if it's allowed here, maybe it's part of a legitimate process like system administration or automated tasks. However, PowerShell is often used by attackers for lateral movement and executing malicious commands, so this could be concerning.\n\nPutting it all together: setup.exe doing normal things, svchost.exe making registry changes which are common but might hide malicious activity, and powershell.exe being used with a command that's somewhat innocuous but could be part of a larger attack. The combination doesn't scream red alert, but there are enough potential indicators to warrant closer inspection.\n\nI think the batch is interesting because while most events seem normal, the svchost and powershell activities could be signs of something more nefarious. However, without more data on timestamps or other related logs, it's hard to be certain. So I'd classify it as INTERESTING with a moderate confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving svchost.exe modifying the registry and creating temporary files, which could indicate malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the entries involve `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be abused for malicious purposes. The fact that there are multiple events from powershell.exe could raise some red flags, especially if they're performing actions that seem out of the ordinary.\n\nLooking at the details:\n\n1. **Image Load Events**: There are several entries where powershell.exe loads different .dll files. These include mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clrjit.dll, and others from various paths. While these might be standard for PowerShell operations, I'm keeping an eye on whether they're being loaded abnormally or from unexpected locations.\n\n2. **File Creation Events**: There are file creations in temporary directories like `C:\\Windows\\Temp` with names like `__PSScriptPolicyTest_...`. These could be related to script policy testing, which is a legitimate activity, but the naming seems unusual and might indicate some form of persistence or malicious scripting.\n\n3. **Command Line Execution**: One event shows powershell.exe running a command that checks for specific .inf files in the Windows directory. This kind of file scanning can be part of system configuration changes or updates, but it's worth investigating if such a script is accessing sensitive areas without proper authorization.\n\n4. **Process Creation and Access**: There are process creation events not just for powershell.exe but also for whoami.exe and cmd.exe. The command executed in the cmd event uses Dism.exe to disable features like Windows Defender. Disabling essential security features could be an attempt to lower system defenses, which is a common tactic in malicious activities.\n\n5. **File Executables Detected**: The Dism.exe process detects files like AssocProvider.dll and DismCorePS.dll from a temporary directory. Temporary files can be suspicious if they're not properly handled or if their origin is unknown.\n\nPutting this all together: While individual actions might seem benign, the combination of multiple powershell.exe activities, file creations in unusual locations, execution of potentially system-altering commands, and disabling of security features suggests a possible malicious intent. The confidence level here is moderate because while some indicators are concerning, others could be part of legitimate processes. However, the overall pattern leans towards something that might warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe activities including image loads, file creations in unusual locations, and command execution potentially indicating malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me start by looking at each event.\n\nAll the events have the same process name: 'Dism.exe'. Dism usually stands for Deployment Image Service Installer, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing operating system images. So that's a good sign; maybe it's just doing normal operations.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, most of them are 'File Executable Detected' except the first one, which is 'File created'. The files being detected are all in temporary directories under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. The paths include various DLLs and MUI files, which I know are standard for language resources and dynamic link libraries.\n\nThe file names like DismHost.exe, DismProv.dll, and the different provider DLLs seem familiar as part of the DISM tool's functionality. These are typical components that DISM would interact with when performing tasks like servicing or preparing OS images.\n\nSince all events come from the same process and involve standard files related to DISM, it doesn't look suspicious. There's no indication of unusual file creation times, sizes, or paths that might hint at malicious activity. No network connections, registry changes, or other anomalies are mentioned here.\n\nThe fact that multiple MUI files are being processed suggests localization support, which is normal for Windows components. The temp directory is a common place for applications to create and process temporary files, so this behavior isn't out of the ordinary.\n\nI don't see any red flags like unexpected executable creations, access to sensitive areas outside the temp folder, or repeated failed attempts that could indicate brute force attacks. All activities here seem consistent with what DISM would do during normal operations, such as servicing an image or preparing updates.\n\nTherefore, considering all events together, this batch doesn't raise any security concerns. It's likely just regular system maintenance or update processing by a legitimate Windows utility.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASON\": \"The events involve the legitimate 'Dism.exe' process creating and detecting standard files in a temporary directory, which is typical for its operations.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. I'm looking at a batch of system log events from a user's JSONL data. The task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. It seems like most of them are related to 'Dism.exe' and involve file executions detected in various DLLs. For example, there are multiple entries where Dism.exe is executing files like TransmogProvider.dll.mui and others. These look like they're part of normal Windows operations because Dism (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) is a legitimate tool used for servicing Windows images.\n\nThen, I notice events involving 'DismHost.exe'. One event shows the creation of DismHost.exe with a specific command line argument, which seems typical when running such tools. Another event loads an image named DismCorePS.dll. Since these are part of the expected behavior when using dismhost.exe, they don't seem suspicious on their own.\n\nLooking at all the events together, I notice that the same temporary directory is being used for multiple files. The path C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\ repeatedly appears, which suggests that this might be a legitimate temporary directory created by the Dism process. Temporary files are common in many applications and aren't inherently malicious.\n\nI also check for any anomalies or signs of malicious activity, like unexpected file paths or processes. There's nothing unusual here—all events relate to known system processes involved in image servicing and management. No signs of unauthorized access or known malware indicators are present.\n\nConsidering all this, the activities described appear to be part of a legitimate process using Dism.exe and its associated tools. Therefore, the batch doesn't raise any red flags that would necessitate further investigation for malicious purposes.\n<\/think>\n\nThe entire batch of events is not considered interesting for cybersecurity investigation. These events represent normal operations of the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (Dism) tool and related processes, which are legitimate components of Windows servicing.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"incident\": {\n    \"determination\": \"not_interesting\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The events involve legitimate system processes (Dism.exe and DismHost.exe) performing normal operations such as file execution and image loading.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where DismHost.exe is loading various DLL files into memory. Each event shows the same process name and task related to image loading, but different file paths. This seems like part of a normal operation since DismHost.exe is associated with Windows deployment services. Loading these DLLs could be standard for its functionality.\n\nThen, I notice that after several ImageLoad events, there's a ProcessTerminate event for DismHost.exe. That makes sense as the process would stop once it's done with the necessary operations.\n\nNext, the logs switch to Dism.exe performing file deletion tasks. It deletes multiple files and DLLs from the same temporary directory where the previous loading occurred. This seems like part of cleanup after the deployment process is completed. The fact that these are being deleted could indicate that they were temporary files used during an update or installation.\n\nI'm considering whether these actions are normal or signs of something malicious. DismHost.exe and Dism.exe are legitimate Windows processes, so their activity shouldn't be suspicious on its own. The files being loaded and deleted are in a temporary directory, which is a common place for such operations to occur without persisting data.\n\nHowever, the volume of events—14 in total, all related to loading and then deleting files from the same temp folder—is a bit high. While it's possible for a legitimate process to generate many events, especially during an update or deployment, I should consider if this is within normal variance.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access, such as multiple failed login attempts or creation of new user accounts. There are no network connections being established or changes to system configurations that might indicate tampering. The files deleted are all in the same location and seem related to each other, which doesn't raise red flags about data exfiltration or malicious payloads.\n\nAnother point is the timing between these events. If they all occurred within a short period, it could suggest a legitimate process completing its work, like an update being applied and then cleaned up. The fact that both DismHost.exe and Dism.exe are involved supports this as they're part of the same system functionality.\n\nI also think about whether the file paths look standard. The temporary directory path C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp is typical for such operations, so there's no indication here of files being written to unusual or hidden locations, which might be a sign of malware.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's important to monitor system logs regularly, in this case, the activities appear to be part of normal Windows operations. There are no indicators of compromise or malicious behavior present.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events is not indicative of suspicious activity and appears to be related to legitimate Windows processes. Here's a concise summary:\n\n1. **Legitimate Processes**: The events involve DismHost.exe and Dism.exe, which are known components of the Windows Deployment Services. These processes handle tasks like loading and unloading deployment-related files.\n\n2. **Normal Operations**: The logs show:\n   - Multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs, which is standard during the execution of deployment operations.\n   - A ProcessTerminate event for DismHost.exe, indicating a normal shutdown after use.\n   - File deletion events by Dism.exe, which are part of cleanup procedures following the completion of an update or installation.\n\n3. **Volume and Timing**: While there are many events, they occur within a context that suggests a legitimate process (e.g., updates or deployments), and the volume is consistent with such operations.\n\n4. **No Signs of Malicious Activity**: There's no evidence of unauthorized access, creation of malicious files, or unusual file paths. All activities are confined to temporary directories, which is typical for non-persistent operations.\n\n**Conclusion**: The logs represent normal Windows system activity related to deployment and cleanup processes. No investigation is necessary based on the provided data."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The first thing I notice is that all the events have the same process name: 'Dism.exe'. Dism usually stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool in Windows, which is typically used for servicing Windows images, so it's a legitimate part of the system.\n\nThe next thing is the 'winlog' field. Each event has a task named 'File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)'. So these are all file deletion events that were detected by some rule in the system. Now, looking at the 'file' path, each entry points to different .dll.mui files located in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder.\n\nThe paths look like they're for various providers: DismProv, FfuProvider, FolderProvider, and so on. These seem to be related to different aspects of Windows setup or servicing. The fact that they are all being deleted by 'Dism.exe' makes sense because Dism is known to handle such operations during image servicing or updates.\n\nI'm also noticing that each event deletes a different file, but the pattern is consistent across all events. They're all .mui files except for one which is .dll in the last event. MUI stands for Multilingual User Interface, so these are probably language packs or localized resources used by Windows components. Deleting them might be part of a cleanup process during image servicing.\n\nSince 'Dism.exe' is a legitimate system tool and the files being deleted are standard in a servicing context, there's no immediate red flag here. However, I should consider whether this activity is normal based on the current system state. If Dism is running as part of an update or deployment process, these deletions would be expected.\n\nBut wait, why so many files? It might indicate that multiple components are being cleaned up, which could still be normal if it's during a bulk operation. Alternatively, it could be part of a malicious activity trying to erase logs or components post-exploitation, but given the nature of the files and the process name, I lean towards legitimate operations.\n\nI should also check the timestamps on these events. If they're all happening in quick succession without any other unusual activities, it's more likely related to a servicing operation. However, if there are signs of other suspicious processes running around the same time, that could change my assessment.\n\nAnother point is whether the user account running Dism has the necessary permissions. Typically, Dism runs with administrative privileges during servicing, so that aligns with what I'm seeing here.\n\nIn summary, while file deletions can sometimes be indicators of malicious activity, in this case, the context provided by 'Dism.exe' and the nature of the files being deleted suggest these are legitimate operations related to system servicing or updates. Therefore, there's a low risk of this being an attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"event_id\": \"Multiple file deletion events\",\n  \"process_name\": \"Dism.exe\",\n  \"task_name\": \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\",\n  \"file_paths\": [\n    \"C:\\\\Users\\\\[Username]\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\33BFE981-...\\\\DismProv.dll.mui\",\n    \"C:\\\\Users\\\\[Username]\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\33BFE981-...\\\\FfuProvider.dll.mui\",\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"risk_assessment\": \"Low risk, likely legitimate system servicing operations.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Monitor for additional suspicious activities but consider these deletions as normal.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out what's going on here. I'm looking at this JSON data that seems to be logs or some kind of system events. It's a bit confusing, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the user provided several entries, each with \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" fields. Some entries have more detailed information, while others are empty or just have placeholders like \"None\". The last few entries seem to be commands executed in PowerShell creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\".\n\nI notice that the first entry has some encoded data under \"data\" which looks like a base64 string. Decoding it might reveal more details about what's happening, possibly related to an exploit or malicious activity.\n\nThe \"winlog\" field mentions tasks like \"Process Create\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\". These are typical Windows events indicating system processes starting or services being managed.\n\nIn the later entries, there's a PowerShell command creating a new service. The command runs New-Service with specific parameters and then starts it. This is a common method attackers use to maintain persistence on a compromised system.\n\nI'm thinking that this could be an attempt at persistence by creating a malicious service that will run every time the system starts. The file path mentioned in the binary path seems suspicious, pointing to a location like \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". That file name sounds generic but could be malicious.\n\nTo understand this better, I should probably look into decoding that base64 string first. Maybe it's some kind of payload or indicator of compromise. Then, analyze the PowerShell command to see if \"objeto_ativo\" is a known service or if it's being used for something nefarious.\n\nI should also consider the implications: if this activity is indeed malicious, the system might be compromised, and action needs to be taken to remove the service and scan for other signs of infection.\n\nSo, in summary, these logs likely indicate unauthorized system changes via PowerShell, possibly installing a backdoor service. Further investigation would involve decoding the base64 data, checking the file's origin, and ensuring all services are legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\nIt seems like you're sharing some log entries that appear to be related to process creation events on a Windows system, potentially involving powershell.exe being used to create or start a service named \"objeto_ativo\". Here's an analysis of what's going on:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Base64 Encoded Data**:\n   - The first log entry contains a base64-encoded string under the `data` field. If decoded, this string might provide additional context about the activity being logged.\n   \n2. **Windows Event Logs (`winlog`)**:\n   - The entries indicate tasks like \"Process Create\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\". These are typical Windows event types related to process creation and service-related activities.\n\n3. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple log entries show a command executed via powershell.exe, creating a new service named `objeto_ativo` with the binary path pointing to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`. This suggests that someone is attempting to create and start a service on the system.\n\n4. **Potential Malicious Activity**:\n   - The use of powershell.exe to create services is often associated with malicious activities, such as persistence mechanisms or deploying malware on a compromised system.\n   - The specific command in the logs (`New-Service` and `Start-Service`) indicates that someone is attempting to create and start a new service. This could be part of an attack chain where attackers establish persistence on the system.\n\n### Steps You Should Take:\n1. **Decode the Base64 String**:\n   - If you want to analyze the content of the base64 string, you can decode it using online tools or programming scripts.\n   \n2. **Investigate the Service**:\n   - Look into what `objeto_ativo` service is and who created it. Check if it's a legitimate service for your system or if it was installed by malicious actors.\n   - Use tools like `sc query` in Windows to list all running services and check their properties.\n\n3. **Inspect the Binary Path**:\n   - Ensure that the binary file at `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` is legitimate. If you're unsure, run it through a virus scan or analyze its behavior using tools like Process Monitor.\n\n4. **Review Recent System Changes**:\n   - Check if there have been other recent changes to your system that could indicate unauthorized access.\n   - Look for other powershell.exe activity in the logs and see if there are any other suspicious processes or services.\n\n5. **Secure Your System**:\n   - If you suspect that your system has been compromised, consider disconnecting it from the network and performing a thorough malware scan.\n   - Apply patches and updates to ensure all vulnerabilities are addressed.\n\n### Example of Decoding Base64 Data (if needed):\nIf the base64 string in the first log entry is decoded, it might reveal additional details about the activity. Here's how you can decode it using Python:\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\nencoded_string = \"uOWda3RrYm+TirJwVj1UaWh1+IdBf+kiaC5qQoKmh29iZgE1RW5kPSLhZG9iZSIsIHBhdG1gPSIvYmx0cXgtc3RyaW5nL3JnbWV0YS9zdGFuY2UvbWU6c3M1MV8xMi9wZWRpdmVkLmFtc3dvcmJlLmNvbS94bXBtYXRlciIvPiA8c3RyaW5nPSIxMCIgPjxzdGFuY2VJRD0iNDhEWTJENEJCMUZDMjlENkQ1NEJFQjgxOTcwOTNBJSIgPjxyZWNvbXBvc2VJRD0iaHR0cHM6Ly9zdmMuYmx0cXgtc3RyaW5nLmNvbS9zdGFuY2VzL3IzMTFwMTEyLmdiYXJ4L21sZS1zczEzLm9yZyI+PC9zdGFuY2VJRD4gPHN0YW5jZUNhY2hlZHMgeG1sbn=S3MxMDAubG9jZQ==\"\ndecoded_string = base64.b64decode(encoded_string).decode()\nprint(decoded_string)\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs you shared suggest that there is suspicious activity on your system involving the creation of a new service using powershell.exe. It's crucial to investigate this further to determine if it's part of a malicious attack or a legitimate process. If you're not sure, it's always better to err on the side of caution and take steps to secure your system."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events, and I need to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, there are a couple of events where the command line starts with powershell.exe. The first two have commands that create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" using New-Service and then start it. That seems a bit unusual because creating services can be a common tactic in malware to persist on a system. I should note that.\n\nThen, there are several events where the command is powershell.exe with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The commands here seem to be writing messages like 'Final result: 1' or similar. But looking closer, some of these have more complex scripts. For example, one script checks for specific patterns in INF files located in the Windows directory. That could indicate they're searching for certain drivers or components, which might be part of a malicious activity trying to hide or install something.\n\nAnother point is that multiple events repeat similar commands. This repetition might suggest automated execution or part of a larger script, possibly indicating an attempt to check system configurations or look for vulnerabilities.\n\nI'm also noticing that the 'file' field is None in all these events. That makes me think there's no file being accessed or written during these processes, which could mean they're memory-only operations, a technique used by some malware to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with restricted execution policies and commands that check system files could be signs of malicious activity. The creation of a new service adds another layer of concern because services are often used for persistence.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that these activities are legitimate, like system administration scripts.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got these three JSONL events to analyze. Let me start by looking at each one individually and then see if there's a pattern or something that stands out when considering all of them together.\n\nLooking at the first event: The process is powershell.exe with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. That caught my attention because using PowerShell with restricted execution might be a way to bypass certain security measures, but I know that sometimes it's used legitimately for safer scripts. The command itself seems to involve reading INF files in the Windows directory. They're checking each file's content for specific patterns related to installation sections.\n\nThe second and third events are almost identical to the first, except for the 'task' field in winlog, which changes between Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle. I'm not entirely sure what these tasks mean, but they might be part of Windows' normal operations, especially since INF files are related to device drivers and system configurations.\n\nSo, putting them all together: All events involve the same PowerShell command, just different log task categories. The script is scanning for specific installation-related sections in INF files. I'm wondering if this activity is usual or not. On one hand, checking INF files could be part of system monitoring or troubleshooting. But since it's using a restricted execution policy and accessing system files, there might be cause to look into it more.\n\nI also notice that the file field is 'None' in all cases, which might mean no additional info was captured there. The command seems automated, perhaps as part of some script or scheduled task. I'm considering whether this kind of activity is common on a system and under what circumstances it would be considered suspicious. It could indicate an attempt to gather information about installed drivers or check for specific configurations that might be exploited.\n\nGiven that all events are from the same process and command, but across different log tasks, I'm leaning towards this being interesting because it's consistent behavior that could have multiple intentions. The confidence isn't super high yet, maybe around 0.6, since I'm not entirely sure if this is malicious or just a legitimate script running.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell executing the same command with restricted execution policy, scanning system INF files for specific patterns.
