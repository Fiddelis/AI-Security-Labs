That seems normal because updates often modify timestamps. Next, CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll — that's part of Windows Defender, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating a pipe. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad but could be something to watch. Services.exe logging on twice — services often start at boot, so multiple logons might not be unusual unless they're unexpected accounts.\n\nThere's an event about user account management without process info; maybe system-level changes, but no details here. Taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll — again, standard for scheduling tasks.\n\nThe next one is a PowerShell command with ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The command checks for INF files matching a pattern. That could be malicious because using PowerShell restrictively can sometimes indicate attempts to bypass protections. However, the presence of such commands might not always be bad, but it's worth noting.\n\nThen there are file creations by powershell.exe and chrome.exe doing registry changes — standard behavior if they're running scripts or extensions.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating files in its directory is expected as it's likely an agent collecting logs. More instances follow with CompatTelRunner loading taskschd.dll again, which I'm not too concerned about.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe from Windows Defender creates a file in the Temp folder and loads some DLLs — this seems normal for antivirus operations.\n\nPutting it all together: Most events are standard system activities like updates, service logons, and defender processes. The PowerShell command stands out because it's using a restricted execution policy to look for INF files, which could be part of malicious activity like dropping drivers or persistence mechanisms. However, without seeing actual file creation or other suspicious actions related to those INF files, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the majority are normal events and the PowerShell command alone isn't enough evidence without more context. But there's a slight chance that this could be malicious, so maybe confidence is around 0.2.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly standard system activities such as updates, service logons, and normal file operations.

Each line is a JSON object representing an event from the system logs. The main points I'm noticing are that all these events involve the creation of files by the process \"git.exe\". \n\nLooking closer, each event has a task associated with it labeled as \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate\". The file paths all point to different JavaScript files located in the node_modules directory, specifically within the \"semver\" package. This suggests that these are part of a Node.js project, where semver is a commonly used module for handling semantic versioning.\n\nThe presence of multiple file creation events from git.exe indicates that this might be related to cloning or updating a repository, as Git often creates files during such operations. The fact that all these files belong to the semver package makes me think that perhaps this is part of installing dependencies or restoring packages in a development environment.\n\nI should consider whether this activity is normal for the system. Since node_modules are standard directories for Node.js applications and semver is a benign library, these file creations don't raise any immediate red flags. There's no indication of unusual file paths, access to sensitive areas, or signs of malicious behavior like unexpected processes or writes to restricted locations.\n\nAdditionally, all events follow a similar pattern: same process name, same task type, and files within the same module. This consistency makes it less likely that these are part of an attack vector. It's more probable that this is routine activity from a developer's machine or CI\/CD pipeline.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to monitor file creation events, especially in sensitive directories, there's no evidence here suggesting malicious intent or a security incident. The activities align with normal software development practices.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe within the node_modules directory, which is typical during package installation or repository cloning.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if this batch of logs is interesting or not for investigation. The user provided a bunch of JSONL entries where each event shows that git.exe created some files in a node_modules directory. \n\nFirst, the process name is git.exe, which is commonly used for version control and doesn't itself indicate malicious activity. Each log entry shows a file creation task under Windows. Looking at the file paths, they're all within \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\", which suggests these are Node.js package files.\n\nNode_modules directories typically contain third-party libraries installed via npm, so seeing these files being created is normal during development or when installing dependencies. The filenames include .js, .json, .md, and others that align with standard package structures. There's no indication of any suspicious file names or paths here; everything looks like expected components of a Node.js project.\n\nI should consider the context. If this happened on a system where Node.js is being used actively, these events are routine. However, if they occurred in an environment where such activities aren't common, it might raise suspicion. But since there's no additional info suggesting unusual behavior or access times, I can't assume foul play.\n\nAnother point: all the events have the same process name and similar file creation tasks, which fits a legitimate git operation like cloning a repository or installing modules. There are no failed attempts, deletions, or other actions that might hint at malicious intent.\n\nSo overall, these logs seem to be part of normal operations rather than indicating any security issue.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by git.exe during Node.js package installations.

These are common Node.js modules used in development. The actions like creating package.json, index.js, and readme.md are standard when setting up or updating a project.\n\nThe fact that git.exe is involved makes sense since it's often used for version control, including managing node_modules as part of the repository. The creation of multiple files under these packages might be during an npm install or a clone operation.\n\nThere's no indication of any unusual behavior, such as access to sensitive files, attempts to write outside the project directory, or signs of file corruption.

The files listed include package.json, readme.md, license, and various .js files, which aligns with how npm modules are structured. Since git.exe is involved, it's likely part of a development workflow where the user is cloning or updating a repository that includes these node_modules.\n\nThere's no indication of any unusual behavior like access to restricted areas, failed login attempts, or unexpected file deletions.

The repeated creation of files under \"node_modules\" indicates that something is downloading or extracting these files, likely during a package installation process.\n\nGiven that all these events come from the same process (\"git.exe\") and involve creating files in standard locations for a development project, it doesn't seem unusual.
