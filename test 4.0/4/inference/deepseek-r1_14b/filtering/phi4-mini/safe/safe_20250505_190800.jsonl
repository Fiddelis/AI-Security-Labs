{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see what each event is telling me.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries related to powershell.exe being executed. I notice that in one event, the command line includes \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\\\teste.ps1\". Using Bypass on the execution policy is a red flag because it allows running scripts that might be unsigned or otherwise restricted, which is often used by attackers.\n\nAlso, there are file creation and deletion events involving PowerShell script files. For example, a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1 was created and then deleted. This temporary script creation can sometimes indicate testing or trying to avoid detection, which might be malicious activities.\n\nThe combination of these actions—using Bypass execution policy, creating and deleting scripts, and loading various .NET components—looks like someone is executing potentially harmful scripts. These behaviors are common in attack patterns where an adversary tries to run malicious code while avoiding logging or detection.\n\nI'm confident that this batch shows suspicious activity, so it's definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances show execution with Bypass execution policy and file operations indicative of potential malicious script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of three log events. Each one involves powershell.exe doing something with files. Let me try to unpack what's going on here.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1. The filename looks pretty random, maybe generated by some script. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nSecond event: Same process deletes the same file it just created. So, create and delete in quick succession. That might be normal for scripts that don't need the file anymore. But why delete it? Maybe to remove any traces or prevent analysis.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe creates another file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. The path seems a bit off, not the usual place for PowerShell profile scripts. Maybe this is part of some automated process, but I'm not certain.\n\nPutting it all together, multiple file operations by powershell.exe could be indicators of malicious activity. The creation and deletion of temporary files might suggest a script trying to hide its actions. Also, writing to an unusual location could be setting up for further activities like persistence or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file operations by powershell.exe, including creation and deletion of temporary files in a suspicious path, may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
