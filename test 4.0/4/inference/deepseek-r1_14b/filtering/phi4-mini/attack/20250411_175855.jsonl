{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections. That seems normal because browsers often connect to the internet. But then I notice some cmd.exe processes with command lines that look suspicious. The command line is \"\/c dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key | findstr \/e .key\". Breaking this down, it's a directory listing in bare format without headers, searching for files ending with .key. This could be an attempt to locate sensitive keys or configuration files, which might indicate malicious activity.\n\nNext, there are several powershell.exe entries accessing processes and modifying the registry. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because of its powerful scripting capabilities. The fact that it's accessing various processes and setting registry values could be part of an attack chain, like persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process running with no arguments, which simply returns user information. That alone isn't suspicious, but when combined with other events, it might indicate reconnaissance activities to gather system information.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of cmd.exe setting registry values and creating processes. The repeated use of RegistryEvent tasks stands out because attackers often use the registry for persistence or to store malicious configurations.\n\nAdditionally, I see a notepad.exe accessing the registry, which is unusual since it's typically used for editing text files. This might be an attempt to modify system settings in an unexpected way.\n\nThere are some file creation events from winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe creating files like tarefa_geral.txt. While log shipping tools can create files, the naming doesn't raise immediate flags, but coupled with other suspicious activities, it could be part of data exfiltration or logging malicious behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple cmd and powershell commands targeting the registry and file system, directory searches for .key files, process access eventsâ€”all these indicate potential malicious activity. The combination suggests a possible attack chain where an adversary is attempting to gather information, establish persistence, and possibly exfiltrate data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications by cmd.exe and powershell.exe, whoami.exe execution, and file creation events which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows the process as calc.exe with an ImageLoad task and the file path pointing to urlmon.dll. That seems normal because calc.exe typically doesn't do malicious things, and urlmon.dll is a known Windows DLL for URL handling.\n\nNext, there are three events from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common process in Windows, often used by services. Setting registry values isn't unusual unless it's part of an exploit or persistence mechanism. But without more context, I'm not sure if this is suspicious.\n\nThen, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is likely part of the ELK stack for log management. The path seems legitimate, so nothing to worry here.\n\nThere are multiple entries from ApplicationFrameHost.exe and chrome.exe accessing registry values or loading images like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are standard operations for these processes. Chrome loads various DLLs as part of its functionality, and ApplicationFrameHost is related to the Windows shell.\n\nThe event with whoami.exe seems benign because it's just used to check user permissions, which doesn't indicate malicious activity on its own.\n\nPowershell.exe events show process accesses and registry writes. Powershell can be both good and bad; while it's often used for legitimate scripting, it's also a common tool for attackers. However, the events here don't show any signs of malicious commands or unusual activities like code execution or file creation. They just access existing processes, which could be part of normal operations.\n\nLooking at all these events together, none of them individually are red flags. The only thing that stands out is the number of RegistryEvent tasks from different processes, but without evidence of unauthorized changes or persistence mechanisms, it's hard to label this as suspicious. All other activities align with typical system behaviors for a user running applications and scripts.\n\nSo, considering the entire batch, I don't see enough indicators of malicious behavior. The events are within normal operational ranges.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes and activities without signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
