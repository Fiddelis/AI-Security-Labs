{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. The user provided 20 JSONL entries, each representing different system activities.\n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of these events are related to PowerShell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. There are multiple instances where PowerShell is being accessed or created as a process. For example, event 5 shows PowerShell creating a new drive with a command line that includes \"& {New-PSDrive...\", which could be an attempt to map a drive or access files in another location.\n\nThen there's the whoami.exe process showing up several times. While whoami is generally used to check user information, its repeated execution might indicate someone trying to gather system information, possibly for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking at the file operations, I see that PowerShell is creating and then deleting a file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1) in the Temp directory. This could be an attempt to execute malicious scripts temporarily, which might suggest script injection or persistence mechanisms. The fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might be an effort to avoid detection.\n\nRegistry modifications are another point of concern. Events show registry values being set multiple times. Malware often uses registry keys to maintain persistence between system reboots, so these events could indicate such activity.\n\nThe command line in event 18 shows a cmd.exe process with the command \"\/c \", which is incomplete and might be an attempt to execute a command without logging or to run something malicious. This could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell executions, script creation\/deletion, registry changes, and whoami runs—these are all indicators that could point to malicious activity. The repeated process creations and file operations suggest potential scripting or automation for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nHowever, some events might be legitimate if the system is running scripts or using PowerShell for administrative tasks. But given the combination of actions and their frequency, it's more likely than not that this batch shows signs of suspicious activity. Therefore, I would classify this as interesting with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe process creations, including command lines showing potential malicious activities such as drive mapping and script execution, along with file creation\/deletion patterns indicative of scripting or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. I'll go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple events involving powershell.exe. Specifically, there are Process Create and File Create events. Powershell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities and can execute commands. The creation of a new process could be legitimate or malicious, but combined with other actions, it might raise flags.\n\nLooking further, there's a file created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1. That name seems suspicious; script policy test scripts are sometimes used to bypass certain security policies. The fact that this file is created and then deleted shortly after (File Delete logged) is concerning because attackers often clean up their tracks.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Image Load events loading various DLLs from different paths. While some of these might be legitimate, others like clrjit.dll could be indicators of malicious activity or attempts to load obfuscated code.\n\nThere's also a Registry value set event. Powershell scripts often interact with the registry for persistence mechanisms, which is another red flag. Attackers may create registry entries to ensure their malicious script runs on each system startup.\n\nAnother point of interest is the process command lines. The events show powershell.exe being called with \"& {}\" which might be an attempt to execute additional commands or scripts in a way that's not immediately obvious, potentially hiding malicious actions.\n\nLastly, the presence of whoami.exe execution could be part of reconnaissance activities, gathering system information to escalate privileges or map out the environment.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—multiple powershell executions, creation and deletion of suspicious files, registry modifications, and image loads—it's highly indicative of potential malicious activity. The combination suggests possible script execution, file manipulation, and persistence mechanisms typical in attacks. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes were created with suspicious command lines, including the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries where 'powershell.exe' is the process involved. That's already something that stands out because PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously. The events include actions like loading images, creating files, deleting them, and accessing processes or registry values.\n\nLooking at the specifics:\n\n1. Multiple ImageLoad tasks from powershell.exe. It's loading various DLLs which is normal for PowerShell scripts to load .NET frameworks and other libraries. However, I should consider if these are standard or if they're trying to load something unusual.\n\n2. There's a file being created in the Temporary folder with a name __PSScriptPolicyTest_gbsqa1tg.2k0.ps1. Then it gets deleted immediately. This pattern—create and delete—is often used by malicious scripts to avoid detection, but sometimes legitimate scripts do this too for testing.\n\n3. There are Pipe Created events, which can be part of normal PowerShell communication between processes or a way for malicious code to create hidden pipes for command execution.\n\n4. Registry value set task: Modifying the registry is common in both good and bad actors. It could be persistence mechanisms or legitimate configuration changes.\n\n5. The 'whoami.exe' executions are interesting too. Using whoami can reveal system information, which a script might use to check permissions or gather data. However, it's also something benign in testing environments.\n\n6. Command lines for powershell.exe show some scripts being executed, like the one checking if procdump.exe exists and exiting based on that. This kind of check could be part of an infection process where the script verifies if certain tools are present before proceeding with malicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not look suspicious, the combination is concerning. The repeated use of PowerShell, file creation\/deletion in Temp folder, registry modifications, and the specific checks for procdump.exe could indicate that an attacker is trying to establish persistence or drop malicious payloads. These behaviors are often red flags for potential malware activity.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider false positives. Sometimes legitimate scripts or system tools can trigger similar logs. But given the volume of PowerShell activities and the pattern of file operations, it's more likely than not that this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe loading various DLLs, creating\/deleting temporary files, accessing processes, and registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm seeing multiple entries where PowerShell is loading various DLLs and deleting files. Then there are instances where whoami.exe and cmd.exe are being executed with commands that disable the Windows Defender Firewall using netsh. Additionally, svchost.exe is making several registry changes.\n\nHmm, PowerShell activities can be legitimate but might also indicate scripting or malicious behavior. The deletion of a .ps1 file could mean it's trying to remove evidence. The disabling of the firewall via netsh and repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe are red flags—common tactics in malware to maintain persistence and hide activity.\n\nGiven these signs, this batch shows potential malicious activities worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show potentially malicious activities including PowerShell process creations, file deletions, disabling of Windows Defender Firewall using netsh commands, and registry modifications by svchost.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. The user has given me a batch of 24 identical JSONL events, each showing that svchost.exe is involved in registry changes. I'm supposed to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I know svchost.exe is a common system process used by various services. But multiple entries in a short time could be suspicious because it's often linked with malware or other malicious activities.\n\nLooking at each event, the task is about registry object changes. That's concerning because attackers might modify the registry to hide their presence or alter system configurations. The repetition suggests either a legitimate process running frequently or something malicious trying to avoid detection by spreading its activity over time.\n\nSince all events are identical and involve svchost.exe modifying the registry, it's worth investigating. However, I'm not certain if this alone is enough to classify as suspicious without more context like timestamps or other related logs. The confidence level isn't too high because isolated registry changes can be normal.\n\nBut considering there are 24 such events in a row, it might indicate something abnormal, so the justification would be that repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe could be malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry changes by svchost.exe may indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized system configuration modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events provided in JSONL format. There are multiple entries here, each representing a different event on the system. Let me go through them one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice several events where the process is 'svchost.exe' and the winlog task is related to registry changes. Specifically, tasks like 'Registry object added or deleted' and 'Registry value set'. These are common operations in Windows, as svchost.exe is a legitimate system process that hosts services. Registry modifications by svchost could be normal, but repeated such events might indicate something suspicious, especially if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen there's an event where the command line points to powershell.exe executing a script: New-PSDrive with parameters pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. This looks like it's trying to map a network drive. However, using Powershell for such tasks isn't unusual on its own. But considering that this is happening multiple times in succession, it could be part of an attempt to establish persistence or access remote resources.\n\nLooking at the sequence, I see a lot of repeated events, especially the svchost.exe and Powershell ones. The repetition might suggest automated behavior or script execution, which isn't inherently malicious but could be a sign if seen in conjunction with other suspicious activities.\n\nI also notice that many of these events have 'file' as None, meaning no file was accessed or modified during those events. This makes it harder to correlate with known malicious files, but it doesn't necessarily mean they're benign.\n\nConsidering the combination, having multiple registry changes followed by Powershell commands could be indicative of an attacker trying to establish a presence on the system. For instance, modifying the registry might involve creating new keys or values that allow persistence across reboots, and the Powershell command could be part of an attempt to access or modify remote files.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that this is legitimate activity, such as during software installation, script execution for backups, or system updates. Without more context, like timestamps showing if these events are happening in quick succession or over a longer period, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nThe fact that there are 20+ events here might raise an eyebrow because repeated similar activities could be part of a larger attack vector. The use of Powershell is a common tactic for adversaries due to its scripting capabilities and the ability to execute commands without being easily detected in some cases.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm leaning towards 'INTERESTING' because while each event on its own might not be malicious, the combination and volume suggest potential malicious activity. The high number of Powershell executions with similar command lines is concerning, as it could indicate a script being run multiple times for different purposes, possibly to spread across systems or escalate privileges.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as 'INTERESTING' because there are red flags in the patterns observed, even though each individual event might not be clearly malicious on its own.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving svchost.exe modifying registry entries and repeated Powershell commands attempting network drive mappings suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm analyzing this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where the command line is `powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}`. This looks suspicious because it's using PowerShell to create a new drive mapping. The use of `-unidade_auxiliar` which seems like an incorrect or misspelled parameter might be intentional obfuscation, possibly to bypass standard logging or detection mechanisms.\n\nThen there are several events where the command line is just `powershell.exe & {}`. Empty scripts can sometimes be used in recon steps to test if PowerShell is running without errors, which could indicate a probe for system availability.\n\nLater on, I see commands like `if (Test-Path \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}`. The path here is quite long and seems to check if a specific file exists. Procdump.exe is often used for dumping processes, which could be part of a malicious payload delivery.\n\nThe combination of these events over time suggests potential malicious activity. Multiple attempts with different command structures might indicate someone trying various methods to execute code or access the system. The repeated use of `powershell.exe` and varied command structures could be an attempt at persistence or lateral movement within a network.\n\nI'm also noting that some entries have different tasks in `winlog`, like 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle', which might not be typical for such commands, especially when combined with the file system operations. The alternating task types could be an attempt to blend in with normal system activity or to bypass certain security measures.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show a pattern that's unusual and potentially indicative of attack behavior. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including drive mapping attempts and file existence checks, possibly indicating malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
