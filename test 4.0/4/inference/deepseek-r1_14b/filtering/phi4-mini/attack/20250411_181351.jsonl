{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. I've been given a batch of JSONL events that represent system logs. My task is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's relevant for investigation. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with only one classification, justification, and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each event in the batch. Each line is a separate JSON object containing process information, Windows log details, and file data. Let me go through them one by one.\n\n1. **Event 1**: The process is 'powershell.exe' and the task is 'Process accessed'. This indicates that PowerShell was accessed, which could be normal if it's being used for legitimate tasks. But sometimes, attackers use PowerShell for command execution or script running, so I'll keep this in mind.\n\n2. **Event 2**: Process 'whoami.exe' created. Whoami is a standard system tool to display user information. It’s usually not malicious, but if it's part of an attack chain, it could be suspicious.\n\n3. **Event 3**: Another PowerShell access event. This repetition might be significant. Running multiple instances or accessing powershell.exe频繁ly could indicate something fishy.\n\n4. **Event 4**: Powershell.exe accessed again and a registry value was set. Modifying the registry is a common tactic for persistence in malware attacks, so this could be concerning.\n\n5. **Event 5**: Process creation of 'powershell.exe' with a command line that includes a script using System.Windows.Forms to capture screen shots and save them as PNGs in the TEMP directory. This seems like it's taking screenshots, which is often used by attackers to exfiltrate data or for persistence.\n\n6. **Event 6**: Another process access event for powershell.exe.\n\n7. **Event 7**: Powershell.exe accessing a registry value again. Multiple writes to the registry might be an attempt at creating a persistent backdoor.\n\n8-11: Several Image Load events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs. This is normal as PowerShell uses .NET libraries, but combined with other suspicious activities, it's something to watch.\n\n12-15: Multiple events where powershell.exe runs the same script multiple times, saving different screenshots to TEMP. The repetitive nature and multiple instances are red flags.\n\nPutting this all together, I notice a pattern of repeated PowerShell usage, registry modifications, and screenshot-taking behavior. These activities could be indicative of malicious scripts trying to capture screen data for some purpose—maybe stealing credentials or information, or establishing persistence by adding entries to the Windows registry.\n\nWhile individual events might not be suspicious on their own (like running whoami.exe or loading .NET libraries), the combination here raises concerns. The repetitive use of PowerShell with specific command-line arguments that involve system calls and file operations in TEMP directory is concerning. Additionally, modifying the registry without a clear legitimate reason could indicate an attempt to create persistence points for malware.\n\nI need to assess the confidence level. Given that these activities are often associated with APTs or malicious scripts aiming to gain persistence and exfiltrate data, there's a high probability that this batch of events is indicative of malicious behavior. However, without more context or evidence of actual data being sent out or system compromise, I can't be 100% certain, but it's definitely on the higher end.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts to capture screenshots and modifying registry values, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL format, there are multiple entries, each with 'process', 'winlog', and sometimes a 'file' field. I'll examine each one to see what they indicate.\n\n1. The first two events show powershell.exe running commands that involve taking screenshots and saving them to the TEMP directory under different filenames like \"estrutura_ativo.png\" and \"unidade_auxiliar.png\". This caught my attention because using Powershell for screen capturing can be a red flag, often associated with malicious activities like screenshoting the desktop without user interaction.\n\n2. The third event is also powershell.exe but it's deleting a file from the TEMP directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1\". Deleting files might be part of an attempt to clean up evidence, which could indicate something malicious. I remember that attackers often delete traces after executing commands.\n\n3. The fourth event shows powershell.exe creating a pipe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication but in the context of Powershell, it's sometimes used by malware to communicate with other processes or for persistence mechanisms.\n\n4. There are two events where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. This could mean that Powershell is executing commands over the network, which might indicate command and control (C2) activity. If the remote command isn't legitimate, this is definitely something to look into.\n\n5. Another powershell.exe event shows an image being loaded from a Windows Defender path: MpClient.dll. While Defender components are legitimate, sometimes attackers may try to load malicious modules or use legitimate processes for their activities.\n\n6. The seventh event again uses Powershell to take another screenshot and save it as \"elemento_base.png\". This repeated behavior of taking screenshots using Powershell is concerning.\n\n7. Then there's an event where a file is created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This could be used for persistence, allowing scripts to run every time Powershell starts. Attackers might place malicious scripts here to maintain access.\n\n8. The next few events involve processes like conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files or accessing registry keys. These seem more benign on the surface, but without context, they could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\n9. There's also an event where ApplicationFrameHost.exe accesses the registry, which is normal for UI-related processes, so probably not suspicious here.\n\n10. Calculator.exe accessing the registry is unusual too. While it's possible for legitimate reasons, it might also be a sign of tampering or malicious activity if there's no clear reason for it to modify registry values.\n\n11. Multiple events show chrome.exe accessing the registry and creating pipes. Since Chrome is a browser, these actions could be part of its normal operations, but repeated Registry modifications by non-standard processes can raise flags, especially in conjunction with other suspicious activities.\n\nPutting this all together: The batch shows several signs of potential malicious activity. Powershell is being used for screenshotting, file deletion, pipe creation, and remote command execution. There are attempts to modify the registry and create files in areas that could be for persistence or data exfiltration. While some events might seem benign on their own, the combination—especially multiple powershell.exe activities with suspicious behaviors—is concerning.\n\nI should also consider confidence levels. The presence of Powershell commands that are typically used maliciously, along with evidence of file manipulation and registry changes, strongly suggests this is worth investigating. However, without more context like timestamps or user activity logs, it's hard to be 100% certain, but the red flags are quite high.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including Powershell screenshotting, file deletion, and remote command execution. Indicators suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE_LEVEL\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. All the events are from chrome.exe, which is a common process and usually doesn't raise red flags on its own. Let's break them down.\n\nThe first event shows chrome.exe setting a registry value, something normal for applications to do during their operation. The second event is a DNS query, which again is typical as part of web browsing. Another registry set follows, same as before.\n\nThen there's an event where chrome.exe loads the MpOAV.dll file from the Windows Defender directory. This seems odd because Chrome shouldn't be loading defender-related files. It might indicate some unauthorized activity or potential tampering with system defenses.\n\nSince all events are related and involve actions that could be part of malicious behavior, especially the file load, I'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting. The confidence is high because the combination of registry changes and loading a defender DLL suggests possible compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and loading of a Defender-related DLL by chrome.exe may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
