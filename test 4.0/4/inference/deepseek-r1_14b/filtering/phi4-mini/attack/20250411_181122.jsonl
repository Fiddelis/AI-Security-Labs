{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That's usually just a system command to get user information, not malicious on its own. But then there are several entries for powershell.exe. Powershell can be used both legitimately and for malicious activities, so I need to look closer at what it's doing.\n\nIn some of these events, the command line shows specific strings like \"findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls\" followed by selecting a pattern with \"password\". That seems suspicious. Using findstr to search for keywords across files and then using select-string to pick up 'password' suggests someone is trying to extract sensitive information. This could be part of an attack, like credential harvesting.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe accesses the registry (Registry value set) and creates or loads various images. These actions are common in malicious scripts to ensure persistence or to load necessary components. The repeated occurrence of the same command line in several events might indicate a script running multiple times or using different techniques to stay undetected.\n\nAnother red flag is the creation and immediate deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file. This could be an attempt to avoid detection by not leaving traces on disk, which is a common tactic in malware. The use of pipes (Pipe Created) might also be part of communication between processes or for redirecting output to hide activity.\n\nLooking at all these together, the pattern suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated command lines and file operations are concerning. It's possible that an attacker is using PowerShell to search through various files looking for passwords, which could lead to unauthorized access. The combination of registry modifications and image loading might be part of a larger script aiming to establish persistence or drop additional payloads.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch shows multiple signs of potentially malicious behavior involving powershell.exe executing commands that seek sensitive information, coupled with actions that are often seen in attack campaigns for persistence and stealth.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs indicate suspicious PowerShell activity including attempts to search for sensitive data (passwords) across various file types.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there's a file creation event for winlogbeat.exe creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file. That seems normal since it's part of the logging setup.\n\nNext, Notepad.exe is setting a registry value. Not unusual; many apps interact with the registry.\n\nThen, PowerShell starts accessing something, which isn't too odd on its own. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so I'll keep an eye out.\n\nThe next event shows PowerShell loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's normal because Defender uses such modules to provide protection features.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the events, there's a PowerShell script using findstr to search for 'pass' in various file types like .xml and .doc. This might be concerning because it looks like it's searching for sensitive information or trying to extract passwords. It could indicate data theft or malicious activity.\n\nSVCHost.exe setting registry values twice doesn't immediately raise a flag since svchost is a common system process, but repeated writes can sometimes be suspicious, especially if they're not related to known services.\n\nFindstr.exe is used in the command line with specific search parameters. The fact that it's searching for 'pass' in multiple file extensions could mean data harvesting, which raises my concern level.\n\nI notice several more events where various processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe are setting registry values. That seems a bit odd because these apps usually don't modify the registry often. This might be an attempt to persistence or alter system configurations maliciously.\n\nThere's also repeated RegistryEvent tasks for different executables, including Chrome.exe multiple times. While Chrome can interact with the registry, excessive writes could indicate something is off. It's possible that a script or tool is running and making these changes as part of its operation.\n\nThe high frequency of PowerShell events—accessing processes, creating files, modifying the registry—is a red flag. Malware often uses PowerShell for execution because it's built into Windows and can execute scripts remotely. The combination of searching for passwords and setting registry values suggests potential persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\nPutting it all together, multiple indicators point towards possible malicious activity: unusual file operations by known malware processes, repeated registry modifications by unexpected applications, and a suspicious script using findstr to search for sensitive data. These activities could be part of an attack chain, such as credential harvesting or establishing backdoors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activity, including suspicious PowerShell command-line arguments searching for 'pass' in sensitive files and repeated registry modifications by various processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe performing DNS queries, file creations, and registry changes. These could be normal browsing activities, but the number might raise a flag. Then, I notice winlogbeat.exe creating files in its data directory. That seems legitimate since it's an agent that logs events, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, powershell.exe shows up multiple times: creating files like 'objeto_logico.txt' and 'estrutura_ativo.txt', accessing processes, and making registry changes. Powershell is commonly used for both good and malicious purposes, so these actions might be concerning. Creating new files could be part of script execution or data collection.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process running without any command-line arguments. That's typically harmless since it just returns user information, but sometimes attackers use it to check permissions. However, in this case, it doesn't seem paired with other malicious actions.\n\nConsidering all events together, the repeated RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe and powershell.exe might indicate persistent changes or attempts to modify system configurations. The file creations by both winlogbeat and powershell could be part of data exfiltration or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe multiple NetworkConnect events from chrome.exe might just be regular browsing, but coupled with the other activities, it's worth looking into. Additionally, the use of powershell for various tasks without a clear benign purpose is a red flag because attackers often use it to execute scripts and hide malicious activity.\n\nPutting this all together, while some actions are normal, the combination—especially the powershell.exe activities and repeated registry modifications—suggests potential malicious behavior that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of chrome.exe performing various tasks, including network connections and registry modifications, alongside powershell.exe creating files and accessing processes suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, looking at the JSONL data provided, each line represents an event with details about processes, Windows logs, and file information.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of process creations involving cmd.exe, powershell.exe, schtasks.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, and WMIC.exe. These are all common tools that can be used both for legitimate purposes and malicious activities. For instance, cmd.exe is often used in command-line attacks, and powershell.exe is frequently abused by attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities.\n\nI see several events where these processes are being executed with specific commands. For example:\n- \"cmd.exe\" is run with \"\/c schtasks \/delete ...\" which suggests the deletion of scheduled tasks. Deleting tasks can be part of removing persistence mechanisms, a common step in malware to avoid detection.\n- There's also a command using wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete, which indicates an attempt to terminate Notepad processes. This could be malicious if Notepad isn't actually running or if it's being used as a cover for something else.\n\nLooking at the Windows log tasks, there are multiple entries related to Process Create and Registry events. The frequent changes to the registry might indicate an attacker trying to modify system configurations or install persistent malware.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of schtasks.exe and WMIC.exe. These tools can be used to create, delete, or manage scheduled tasks, which attackers often do to maintain persistence across reboots. The fact that multiple tasks are being deleted in different events raises suspicion.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where whoami.exe is executed. This tool is typically used to determine the current user and their privileges. If this is part of a larger sequence, it could be an attacker checking permissions or gathering system information for further attacks.\n\nThe ImageLoad events for schtasks.exe and WMIC.exe loading various DLLs might not be suspicious on their own, but combined with other activities like process creation and registry changes, it adds to the concern. The fact that these are repeated multiple times in the logs suggests a possible automated script or tool being used.\n\nOverall, the combination of deleting scheduled tasks, terminating processes, modifying the registry, and using command-line tools frequently points towards potential malicious activity. While some actions could be legitimate (like system administration), the volume and specific commands make this batch worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of process creations, registry modifications, and deletions of scheduled tasks, which may indicate potential malicious activity such as removing persistence mechanisms or terminating legitimate processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries involving PowerShell.exe. I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and also for malicious activities because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The fact that it's being accessed several times might be a red flag, but sometimes admins use it regularly too.\n\nLooking at the events, I see that PowerShell is accessing processes and modifying registry values. One of them even shows a Registry value set event. That could mean someone is trying to change system configurations or persistence mechanisms, which are common in malware. For example, attackers often use the registry to maintain their presence on a system.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed multiple times. Whoami is usually used to check user information, but if it's run repeatedly without a clear reason, it might indicate reconnaissance activities. Maybe an attacker is trying to gather info about the current user or privileges.\n\nThe cmd.exe processes are also noteworthy. They're executing commands like net user \/del, which deletes users. Deleting user accounts can be part of privilege escalation or removing traces after an attack. The command lines show they're deleting specific admin accounts, which seems suspicious because legitimate admins usually wouldn't delete their own accounts without a reason.\n\nNet.exe and net1.exe are also being used with similar commands to delete users. This repetition across different tools (cmd, net, net1) is concerning. It suggests someone is trying multiple methods to ensure the deletion goes through, possibly avoiding detection or using different utilities in case one is blocked.\n\nConhost.exe appears a few times and modifies registry values. Conhost is part of the Windows operating system, but its use can sometimes be associated with malicious scripts because it's used for hosting content, like HTML applications. Combined with registry modifications, this could indicate an attempt to create persistence points or modify system behavior in ways that are hard to detect.\n\nI also notice that some commands redirect output to null (like >nul 2>&1), which is a common tactic to hide the command's output from appearing in logs or command prompts. This makes it harder to spot malicious activity because there's less noise.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of deletion commands across different tools and the registry modifications by PowerShell and conhost are strong indicators of potential malicious behavior. The batch shows a pattern of user deletions which could be part of an attack aimed at removing administrative accounts to limit detection or to escalate privileges. Additionally, the hiding of command outputs suggests an attempt to stay under the radar.\n\nWhile it's possible that a system admin is performing these actions for legitimate reasons, the combination of multiple high-privilege commands across different tools and the registry modifications makes this batch stand out as potentially malicious. Therefore, it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of user deletion commands using cmd.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe suggest potential privilege escalation or account removal activities.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events:\n\n1. **cmd.exe** is being used with a command-line argument `\/c sc delete win32times`. This seems like an attempt to delete a service named 'win32times'. It could be legitimate or part of malicious activity trying to remove monitoring tools.\n\n2. The next event shows **powershell.exe** being accessed, which is common in both legitimate and malicious activities. PowerShell can execute scripts and commands, so this alone isn't suspicious unless the command is malicious.\n\n3. Another **cmd.exe** process sets a registry value. This could be part of normal system operations or might be used by malware to modify system configurations.\n\n4. **sc.exe** is used with `delete win32times`. Similar to the first event, this could be an attempt to remove a service, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\n5. Multiple events involve **services.exe**, which handles service-related tasks in Windows. The logs show registry modifications, but without context on what services are being modified, it's hard to say if they're suspicious.\n\n6. Several instances of **whoami.exe** running without any command-line arguments suggest simple process creation, likely not malicious unless used for privilege escalation.\n\n7. There's a cmd.exe deleting files in the Temp directory. The file paths deleted include `tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe` and `estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe`. These filenames look suspicious, possibly remnants of a malicious script trying to clean up evidence after execution.\n\n8. Multiple **powershell.exe** instances with various tasks, including registry modifications and provider\/engine lifecycle events. The repeated use of PowerShell without clear legitimate activity could indicate malicious behavior, especially the `Provider Lifecycle` tasks which might be part of establishing persistence or loading modules.\n\n9. Lastly, several events where **powershell.exe & {}** is executed, possibly a way to run scripts that don't require output, often used in command injection attacks or to hide commands.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of deleting services (cmd.exe and sc.exe), suspicious file deletions, repeated use of PowerShell with various tasks, and registry modifications suggests potential malicious activity. These actions could be part of an attack chain, such as establishing persistence, removing monitoring tools, or deleting evidence. While some events are common, the overall pattern raises concern.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including service deletions, file removals, and extensive PowerShell usage indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so that catches my attention. I notice multiple instances where powershell.exe is creating processes and accessing various system components like the registry and files.\n\nOne event shows powershell.exe creating a file in the Temp directory named with a random-looking name: __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. This seems suspicious because it's creating a script file, which could be part of malicious activity. Then, immediately after, there's a File Delete logged event for that same file. Deleting scripts after execution is often a tactic to cover tracks, so this behavior raises red flags.\n\nAnother point is the use of whoami.exe multiple times. While whoami is generally harmless and used to check user permissions, repeated executions without clear context could indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nI also see powershell.exe accessing system files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are legitimate but might be part of a larger attack chain. The file creation by winlogbeat.exe seems less concerning on its own, but in the context of other events, it's worth noting as it could relate to log monitoring tools.\n\nOverall, the combination of creating\/deleting scripts, accessing system files, and repeated process creations with powershell.exe indicates potential malicious behavior. These actions don't appear to be part of normal user activity and align with tactics used in cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activities including script creation, deletion, and multiple process creations\/deletions which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst event: whoami.exe is running with the command line pointing to its usual location in C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe. The winlog task is Process Create, which makes sense because that's a common system process for identifying user information. Nothing suspicious here; it's probably just a legitimate user checking their permissions.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe being accessed with the 'ProcessAccess' rule. PowerShell is commonly used by admins but can also be abused by attackers. However, looking at the context, these events don't show any malicious commands or unusual access patterns. They're just being opened without further action indicated.\n\nThen, RuntimeBroker.exe accessing registry values. That's normal for Windows processes as they often interact with the registry for configuration. No red flags here.\n\nNotepad.exe also accesses a registry value. Again, not an uncommon activity; many applications read from the registry during operation.\n\nCalc.exe loads urlmon.dll when it runs. Wait, that seems a bit off because Calculator usually doesn't need to load URL-related DLLs. However, urlmon.dll is part of Windows, so maybe it's used for some system functionality. Not sure if this alone is malicious, but could be something to look into.\n\nsvchost.exe modifying registry values multiple times. SVCHOST is a standard process that hosts various services, and it's normal for it to interact with the registry. Unless there are specific indicators of compromise tied to these accesses, they don't seem suspicious.\n\nThere's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of their log management setup, so that's expected behavior as it writes logs or config files.\n\nAnother powershell access without any indication of malicious activity, just being accessed again.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe accessing the registry—this is typical for application containers in Windows, so nothing unusual there.\n\nCalculator.exe accessing the registry again. Since we saw calc.exe earlier loading urlmon.dll, maybe this is part of its normal operation or perhaps an attempt to elevate privileges, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe events: Dns queries and network connections. Chrome is a browser; these are standard activities when navigating the web. Unless they're connecting to known malicious domains, which isn't indicated here, this shouldn't raise flags.\n\nPutting all this together, most of these events are normal system processes doing what they typically do. The only potentially concerning ones are calc.exe loading urlmon.dll and multiple powershell accesses. However, there's no evidence of actual misuse or exfiltration in the logs provided. Without additional context or indicators like known malicious file hashes or network destinations, it's hard to classify this batch as definitely suspicious.\n\nSo, I think the batch isn't particularly interesting for investigation because while there are a few unusual points, they don't collectively indicate malicious activity without more data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes such as whoami.exe, powershell.exe accessed without suspicious activities, and standard applications like chrome.exe performing routine actions. There's no evidence of malicious behavior or indicators of compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
