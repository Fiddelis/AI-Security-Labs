Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where PowerShell.exe is being executed. I know that PowerShell can be used both for legitimate administrative tasks and for malicious activities, so repeated use might be suspicious. The command lines in these events show things like importing modules and executing scripts, which could indicate someone trying to run arbitrary code or perhaps lateral movement.\n\nLooking at the specific commands, there's a script being imported from \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The path seems a bit long and uses some non-English directory names, which might be unusual depending on the system's locale. Also, the script is executed with Invoke-entrada_principal, which doesn't look like standard PowerShell cmdlets.\n\nI notice that after executing this script, there are file creation and deletion events for \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1\" in the Temp directory. This could be an attempt to create a malicious script temporarily or to bypass certain security policies by testing script execution.\n\nThere's also activity involving svchost.exe and sppsvc.exe, which are legitimate system processes, but their file and registry operations might need closer examination. For instance, creating files in SoftwareDistribution DataStore or modifying the registry could be part of update processes, but without more context, it's hard to say if these are normal.\n\nAnother point is the use of pipes created by PowerShell.exe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which might be legitimate, but sometimes attackers use them to establish command and control channels or to hide their activities.\n\nThe events related to image loading (mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll) suggest that .NET framework components are being loaded, which is normal for PowerShell scripts. However, the specific combination of these modules with other activities might be worth investigating.\n\nIn summary, while some of the activity could be part of normal system operations or user actions, several red flags stand out: multiple PowerShell executions with non-standard commands, file creations and deletions in temporary directories, and potential script execution attempts. These patterns collectively raise concerns about possible malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially suspicious scripts, including file creation\/deletion in Temp directory and non-standard command-line arguments.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's take a look at each event and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where svchost.exe is creating files in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory with various .dll extensions. That seems a bit unusual because svchost.exe is typically a legitimate Windows process, often associated with services like those from System32. But seeing it creating so many different DLLs could be suspicious. Malware sometimes uses svchost as a host for malicious activities.\n\nNext, there are some Image Load events where svchost.exe loads BitsProxy.dll and taskschd.dll. These files seem normal on their own, but the combination with other actions might raise flags. Also, the process backgroundTaskHost.exe loading urlmon.dll doesn't immediately concern me, but it's worth noting.\n\nThen, there are several Registry value set events from svchost.exe without any file path, which could mean they're modifying the registry. That's another point of interest because attackers often tweak system configurations to maintain persistence or alter system behavior.\n\nAnother event is the creation of a log file named edbtmp.log in the DataStore\\Logs directory. I'm not sure what that file typically contains, but the naming makes me think it might be related to error logging, which could be normal, but again, considering the context of other events, it's worth watching.\n\nLooking at all these together: multiple writes to SoftwareDistribution with various DLLs, registry modifications, and a log file creation. These activities don't align with typical svchost.exe behavior. It might be part of legitimate Windows updates or servicing stack operations, but sometimes attackers use such techniques for lateral movement or to drop malicious payloads.\n\nThe high frequency of events from the same process and multiple writes to sensitive directories increases my concern. While some could be normal, especially if this relates to update processes, the volume and combination are red flags.\n\nTherefore, I think this batch is interesting enough for further investigation because it doesn't fit standard behavior and has elements that could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events from svchost.exe in the SoftwareDistribution directory, along with registry modifications and a log file creation, suggest potential malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events and figure out if they're interesting or not. \n\nFirst off, I see a lot of events related to file creation and registry changes by svchost.exe. That process is known for being part of legitimate Windows services but can also be used by malware because it's commonly allowed in many environments. The fact that there are multiple registry writes could indicate some kind of configuration change, which might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with other events...\n\nLooking further, I notice svchost.exe creating files in the SoftwareDistribution Download folder. This is a known Windows Update directory, so file creation here isn't unusual. However, the specific paths like '3d2d4f109832e8e4a9776db11ac71c44' and subsequent subdirectories might be worth checking for any signs of tampering or unexpected files.\n\nThen there are events from MpSigStub.exe creating files in the Temp directory. This process is related to Windows Defender, so it's not immediately suspicious, but multiple file creations could indicate a script running periodically. It's something to monitor but not necessarily alarming unless these files are found elsewhere.\n\nThe 'setup.exe' entries installing Edge-related executables also stand out a bit. Setup processes are common during software installations or updates. The creation of an IE-to-Edge stub and a cookie exporter seems normal if it's part of a legitimate update, but without more context on what exactly is being installed, it's hard to say.\n\nLastly, MsMpEng.exe loading mpengine.dll is expected behavior for Windows Defender, so that's nothing to worry about.\n\nPutting it all together: while each event individually doesn't raise red flags, the combination shows multiple processes creating files and making registry changes. This could be indicative of malicious activity trying to blend in with normal system operations. The confidence level isn't super high, maybe around 0.5, but there's definitely something worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events and registry modifications by svchost.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.5\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'm looking at the batch of events provided. There are multiple JSON objects, each representing an event from system logs. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes. \n\nStarting with the first few events, I see that 'setup.exe' is creating files in the Microsoft Edge directory. That seems normal since setup.exe is typically used for software installation, and creating necessary files would be part of that process. So nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, RuntimeBroker.exe accessing registry values isn't unusual either. It's a known Windows process involved in handling runtime events and often interacts with the registry.\n\nThen I notice powershell.exe appearing multiple times. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The presence of multiple ProcessCreate events for PowerShell might be worth looking into, especially if there are unusual command lines or file operations.\n\nLooking at one specific event, there's a command line in powershell.exe that stands out: \"& {New-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" -BinaryPathName \\\"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\tarefa_logico.exe\\\" Start-Service...\". Creating a new service and starting it could be a sign of malicious activity, especially if the service is meant to run arbitrary code. The paths mentioned in BinaryPathName look suspiciousâ€”using backslashes inconsistently (mixing \\ and \\\\) might indicate tampering or an attempt to hide the true path.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation and subsequent deletion of a PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1). This is concerning because it suggests that malicious code was dropped temporarily and then deleted to avoid detection. Such behavior is common in attacks where adversaries try to erase their tracks.\n\nAnother red flag is the multiple RegistryEvent tasks from services.exe. While services do interact with the registry, repeated writes might be an attempt to modify system configurations or create persistence points for malicious activities.\n\nFurthermore, the creation of a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" (which translates to \"active object\") and its associated file path leading to tarefa_logico.exe is suspicious. The naming suggests it's part of some automated task or payload delivery mechanism, which could be harmful.\n\nAlso, powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll might be standard for running scripts, but combined with the other activities, it raises concerns about code injection or malicious scripting.\n\nIn summary, while some events on their own aren't alarming, the combinationâ€”especially the PowerShell activity, creation of a new service, file operations, and registry modificationsâ€”points to potential malicious behavior. This batch definitely warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious command lines and activities, including the creation of a new service and deletion of temporary script files, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the logs are in JSONL format, each line representing a separate event. Each event has three fields: process, winlog, and file.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n- The process is named 'tarefa_logico.exe' and the winlog task is 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'. This indicates that this executable is being loaded into memory. The file paths point to .NET framework components, which are legitimate system files. So, this doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nNext event still has 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading another .NET component, again a known and standard part of Windows. No red flags here.\n\nThen, the logs switch to 'powershell.exe'. The first winlog task is 'File created', with a path under the user's AppData folder. PowerShell scripts are common in legitimate use, but creating files in non-standard locations could be worth noting.\n\nThe next event shows 'Registry value set' from powershell.exe. Modifying registry values isn't inherently malicious, but it's a common tactic for persistence or configuration changes by attackers. I'll keep this in mind.\n\nMoving further down, there are events where the process is null, and the winlog task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. The file paths here point to .ps1 scripts located at specific paths on the system. This suggests that PowerShell is executing remote commands, which could be part of legitimate administration or could indicate malicious activity like script execution over the network.\n\nLooking at subsequent events, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being called with command lines that import a module from 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. The paths here look suspicious because they're not in standard Windows directories. Additionally, the scripts attempt to invoke a function named Invoke-entrada_principal, which isn't a known cmdlet or function in PowerShell. This could be custom code, possibly malicious.\n\nMoreover, these command lines include error handling that exits with an HResult on catch blocks. While this is common practice in scripting, combined with the remote execution and file creation events, it raises concerns about potential malicious intent.\n\nThe logs also show attempts to create a service named 'objeto_ativo' using New-Service and Start-Service cmdlets. Creating new services can be a way for malware to achieve persistence on the system. If this service is running without proper authorization or if it's performing unexpected tasks, it could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThe repetition of similar command lines across multiple events suggests automated execution, possibly from a script that's run multiple times or triggered by an external process. This kind of repeated behavior can be indicative of both legitimate scripts and malicious activities like testing for persistence or deploying payloads.\n\nConsidering the combination of all these events:\n- Use of PowerShell executing remote commands.\n- Creation of services with custom names.\n- Execution of scripts from non-standard paths.\n- Error handling that could mask malicious actions.\n\nWhile some individual events might not be suspicious on their own, the pattern and combination of activities strongly suggest potential malicious behavior. The repeated attempts to execute scripts, create services, and handle exceptions are common tactics in cyberattacks to maintain persistence and hide malicious activities.\n\nTherefore, these logs should be considered interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint, as they display several red flags that could indicate an ongoing or attempted attack.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initial Observations:**\n   - The logs show multiple events involving `tarefa_logico.exe` loading legitimate .NET components, which is not suspicious on its own.\n\n2. **Transition to PowerShell Activity:**\n   - The switch to `powershell.exe` performing file creation and registry modifications flags potential administrative or malicious activity.\n\n3. **Suspicious File Paths and Scripts:**\n   - Execution of scripts from non-standard paths (`C:\\unidade_logico\\...`) raises concerns, as legitimate scripts typically use standard directories.\n\n4. **Custom Command-Line Functions:**\n   - The use of `Invoke-entrada_principal` is not a known cmdlet, suggesting potentially malicious or custom code execution.\n\n5. **Error Handling Mechanisms:**\n   - Error handling in scripts can mask malicious activities, making it harder to detect and respond to attacks.\n\n6. **Service Creation Attempts:**\n   - Creating services named 'objeto_ativo' with non-standard paths could be a persistence technique used by malware.\n\n7. **Repetitive and Automated Behavior:**\n   - The repetition of similar command lines suggests automated execution, which is often seen in attacks for persistence or payload deployment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of these activitiesâ€”executing scripts from unusual locations, creating custom services, and employing error handlingâ€”indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent. These logs should be investigated further to determine if an attack is occurring or has occurred. Therefore, the batch is deemed **interesting** for cybersecurity analysis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interested\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The events indicate potential malicious activity including script execution from non-standard paths, service creation attempts, and repeated patterns indicative of automated attacks.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm new to cybersecurity, so I'll have to think through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the logs provided, I see that there are two main types of events: ones involving PowerShell commands and others related to executing remote commands from a specific script path.\n\nThe first group has multiple entries where the process is running powershell.exe with some command-line arguments. The command seems to be creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and setting its binary path to an executable in a directory structure that includes terms like \"unidade_logico\" which I think might mean \"logical unit\" in Portuguese, possibly referring to disk drives or storage units. Then it starts the service.\n\nI know that creating services via PowerShell can be legitimate for system administration, but it's also common for malware to create persistent entries to maintain access. The fact that this is done multiple times (three instances) might raise a flag because repeated attempts could indicate testing or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe second group of events shows remote command executions from the same script file: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. There are several entries here, up to nine times in one batch, which seems excessive. Repeated execution of a script might suggest either a legitimate automated process or potential malicious activity, like dropping and executing scripts from an external source.\n\nI also notice that some events have \"process\" as None but log the remote command executions, which could imply that another process (maybe the powershell.exe one) is triggering these commands. The fact that the script path includes \"registro_secundario\" and \"componente_auxiliar\" might be significant, possibly indicating components of a larger malicious payload.\n\nThe combination of creating new services with specific names and repeatedly executing scripts from a potentially unfamiliar location makes me suspicious. Malware often creates services to ensure persistence across reboots and uses scripts to execute commands at intervals or upon certain triggers.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to be certain. But the frequency of these events and their nature (service creation and remote command execution) is concerning enough that an investigation would be warranted to check if this activity is authorized or part of a breach.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell commands creating services and executing remote scripts, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of 15 events. Each one has similar data: \"process\" is None, the Windows log task is \"Execute a Remote Command\", and the file path points to C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1.\n\nFirst, the repetition stands out. All events are identical, which suggests a possible automated process or script running multiple times. The file path ends with .ps1, indicating it's a PowerShell script. Malware often uses scripts for execution because they can be more evasive and allow for various malicious activities.\n\nThe task is \"Execute a Remote Command.\" This could mean legitimate administration tasks, like remote PowerShell commands used by admins. But it's also common in attacks to execute malicious scripts remotely. The fact that the same script path is used repeatedly might indicate an attempt to run the same command multiple times, possibly trying different parameters or targets.\n\nConsidering the combination, 15 identical events with a script execution task could be part of an attack vector. It's possible that this script is attempting lateral movement within a network, data exfiltration, or installing malware components. The high number of attempts might trigger alerts for potential brute force attacks or credential stuffing, but in this case, it's about script execution.\n\nI'm also thinking about the context: if this script is legitimate, why is it being run so many times? Maybe a loop in a script causing repeated executions, which could be accidental or part of an exploit. The file path structure doesn't immediately ring as suspicious, but without knowing what's inside componente_auxiliar.ps1, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nOverall, the combination of repeated remote command execution events targeting the same script is concerning. It's not a common pattern for normal operations and could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events showing repeated attempts to execute a remote command on the same PowerShell script, which may indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
