{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the majority of the events are related to powershell.exe processes. That immediately catches my attention because PowerShell is often used by both admins and attackers for various tasks, sometimes malicious. There are multiple entries showing process creation, image loading, registry activity, file operations, and more.\n\nLooking at the specific actions: there's a FileCreate event for a temporary script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xz0wqw5j.ptd.ps1. Then it's immediately deleted with a FileDeleteDetected event. That seems suspicious because creating and then deleting a script file could be part of an attempt to bypass certain security policies, like script execution restrictions. This is known as a \"script testing\" technique where attackers might test malicious scripts in temporary files they create and delete quickly to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Registry value set events. Registry modifications can be indicators of malicious activity, especially if they involve persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations without proper authorization.\n\nThe process also loads various DLLs which is normal for PowerShell, but the specific paths like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender could be part of legitimate operations, though it's worth checking if these were accessed in an unusual context.\n\nThere are multiple events related to provider and engine lifecycle tasks, which might not be as concerning on their own, but combined with other actions could indicate the script is doing more than just simple operations. The repeated Provider Lifecycle tasks might suggest some kind of loop or prolonged activity by the script.\n\nThe creation of a file in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory is also notable. This could be an attempt to persistence across reboots, though without further context on what's inside that file, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of powershell.exe with command lines like \"powershell.exe & {Get-Date}\". While Get-Date is a benign cmdlet, the way it's invoked could be part of obfuscation techniques. Attackers might use such commands as part of a larger script or to test if monitoring tools are in place.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple events over what seems like a short period (maybe minutes) suggests active and potentially malicious behavior rather than normal system noise. The combination of file creation\/deletion, registry changes, and repeated process activity points towards potential malicious scripting.\n\nSo putting it all together, the batch shows signs of suspicious activity involving PowerShell processes creating temporary files, modifying the registry, and possibly attempting persistence mechanisms. These are red flags that could indicate a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious use of PowerShell, including file creation\/deletion of a script file, registry modifications, and repeated process activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of four JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: Powershell.exe creates a file named 'estrutura_logico.txt'. That's suspicious because Powershell is often used in scripts and can be malicious. Creating a new file might indicate data exfiltration or log tampering.\n\nSecond event: Again, Powershell sets a registry value. Registry modifications are common in attacks to maintain persistence or change system configurations. This adds more concern about potential malicious activity.\n\nThird event: Powershell accesses another process. Process access can be part of lateral movement within a network. If it's accessing other processes, that could mean privilege escalation or spreading the infection.\n\nFourth event: Winlogbeat creates a file in its data directory. That's less concerning since it's likely part of normal log shipping activity, assuming Winlogbeat is correctly configured and not compromised.\n\nLooking at all events together, the repeated use of Powershell with multiple potentially malicious actions stands out. The combination suggests possible command and control or lateral movement activities. While the fourth event isn't suspicious on its own, the other three raise red flags about potential compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe performing potentially malicious actions such as file creation, registry modification, and process access suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
