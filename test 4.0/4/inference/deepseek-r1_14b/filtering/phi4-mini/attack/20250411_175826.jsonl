{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the events involve several processes. There are multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. Then there are powershell.exe instances, including command lines that look suspicious. Specifically, I see some complex command lines in powershell.exe where files are being accessed, modified, and deleted. For example, they're setting LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\", which is a common tactic in malware to hide file modifications.\n\nAlso, there are processes creating temporary PowerShell scripts, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1, and then deleting them. This behavior can be indicative of script execution attempts or trying to bypass certain security policies by cleaning up after themselves quickly.\n\nAdditionally, the use of Registry value sets in powershell.exe could mean they're attempting persistence mechanisms or modifying system configurations to maintain access. The repeated ProcessAccess events might show lateral movement within the system, accessing different processes.\n\nLooking at other entries, there are some instances where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle' with command lines that again modify file times on various paths. These seem similar in nature to the previous ones, possibly trying to alter file metadata across different directories.\n\nPutting it all together, these events don't look like normal user activity. The pattern of using PowerShell for batch operations, modifying file timestamps, creating and deleting temporary files, and interacting with system processes and registry settings are red flags. These could be signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, persistence mechanisms, or attempts to cover tracks.\n\nHowever, I'm not 100% certain because some of these actions might also occur during legitimate system administration tasks. But given the frequency and specific operations, especially the file timestamp modifications and the temporary script creations\/deletions, it's leaning towards suspicious behavior.\n\nSo, considering all this, the batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands that modify file timestamps and create\/delete temporary scripts, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few events involve powershell.exe with command lines that set LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970\". That seems suspicious because changing file timestamps can be a common tactic in malware to avoid detection or to hide activity. These events are all from Provider Lifecycle, which is related to Windows services starting up.\n\nThen there's an event where svchost.exe sets a registry value. SvcHost is often used by legitimate services, but it can also be abused by malware. I should keep that in mind.\n\nNext, Calculator.exe loads urlmon.dll. That's a normal system file, so nothing unusual here unless Calculator is being used for something else.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event loads MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. This seems legitimate since Defender uses PowerShell scripts.\n\nThere are more powershell.exe events modifying timestamps on various files. Each of these could be an attempt to alter logs or hide changes made by malicious code.\n\nLooking further, there's a file created event for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is an ELK component used for log shipping, so if it's running and creating config files, that might not be suspicious unless the system isn't supposed to have this installed.\n\nMultiple Registry value sets from chrome.exe are present. Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings, extensions, or plugins, so these could be normal unless they're accessing unexpected areas.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a pattern of multiple PowerShell instances modifying file timestamps and some registry changes. While some events might not be malicious on their own, the combination—especially several attempts to alter timestamps using powershell.exe across different files—raises concerns about potential tampering or persistence mechanisms. The use of svchost.exe and Registry modifications adds to the suspicion. However, without more context or additional indicators like unusual file creation or network activity, it's hard to be certain. But the volume of PowerShell activities with similar patterns stands out.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes modifying timestamps on various files and Registry changes could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. I'm trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one:\n\n1. The first event is about chrome.exe loading the amsi.dll file. That seems normal since Chrome would interact with System32 files for various functionalities.\n2. Next, another chrome.exe event where it sets a registry value. Again, this isn't unusual as applications often modify the registry during operation.\n3. Then there's winlogbeat.exe creating a new YAML file. Winlogbeat is an agent that collects logs and stores them, so it's expected for it to create configuration files. Nothing suspicious here.\n4. The fourth event involves powershell.exe creating a file named unidade_logico.txt. PowerShell can be used maliciously, but not all file creations are bad. Without more context on the content or location, this could just be legitimate activity.\n5-10: Multiple chrome.exe events showing registry writes. Since Chrome is known to make frequent changes to the registry for settings and extensions, these events might just be normal operations.\n\nConsidering all together, there's a mixture of processes writing to the registry and creating files. The only potentially concerning point is the use of powershell.exe, but in this case, it's just creating a file without any other indicators of malicious activity. There's no evidence of known bad actor behavior, encryption activities, or attempts to access restricted resources.\n\nSo, overall, these events don't raise red flags and likely aren't indicative of an attack. They seem to be normal operational traffic.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains standard system activities such as loading DLLs, registry modifications, and file creations related to legitimate processes like Chrome, Winlogbeat, and PowerShell. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
