Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where 'chrome.exe' is making network connections and DNS queries. That's pretty normal because Chrome does a lot of networking for browsing. Nothing unusual here; it's just standard activity.\n\nNext, I see 'powershell.exe' appearing multiple times. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. The first event shows that someone accessed the process, which could mean they're exploring or manipulating it. Then there are registry eventsâ€”modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware.\n\nLooking further, there's a 'Process Create' event with a command line that seems suspicious. The path mentioned is \"\\C:\\\\registro_logico\\\\estrutura_secundario\\\\..\\\\unidade_ativo\\\\objeto_padraounidade_padrao.txt\", which looks like it might be trying to access or modify system structures. That could indicate tampering or attempting to elevate privileges.\n\nAlso, the script being executed and then deleted quickly is a red flag. Malicious scripts often delete themselves to avoid detection. The file creation and deletion in quick succession suggests an attempt to run something without leaving long-term traces.\n\nThere are several image load events for PowerShell loading various .dll files. While this is normal for scripts that use .NET, the combination with other suspicious activities makes me concerned about potential code execution or lateral movement within a network.\n\nAdditionally, there's a pipe created by PowerShell, which can be used for inter-process communication. This could be part of a command and control channel or data exfiltration.\n\nThe logs also show other processes like 'RuntimeBroker.exe' and 'notepad.exe' modifying the registry, which is less concerning on its own but adds to the overall picture when combined with the PowerShell activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with potentially malicious command lines, file operations, and registry modifications points towards possible exploitation or attack. The deletion of a created script quickly after its creation is another indicator of bad behavior. While some events are common, the combination suggests there's something worth investigating here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell activities, including suspicious command-line arguments and file operations that may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several events where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that seem a bit unusual. The command lines involve Get-ChildItem and setting LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\". That date stands out because it's the Unix epoch, often used in programming as a starting point. It might indicate some script is trying to reset file timestamps, which could be part of an attempt to hide activity or make files appear older than they are.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, most of them are either \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\". These don't immediately raise red flags, but when combined with the powershell commands, it's worth noting. There's also a FileCreate event by winlogbeat.exe, which is probably part of log shipping and not malicious.\n\nThen there are events involving calc.exe and svchost.exe loading urlmon.dll and MpClient.dll. Those seem normal because these processes do load system DLLs, but the repeated Registry value sets in svchost.exe could be suspicious since it's a common process used by services, and unusual activity here might indicate a backdoor or persistence mechanism.\n\nThere's an event where powershell.exe creates a file in the StartupProfileData directory. This is interesting because creating files in user directories can be part of lateral movement or persistence techniques. Additionally, another powershell.exe event sets a registry value, which could be modifying system configurations to maintain access.\n\nLastly, conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe events seem benign. Conhost is a Windows component used by the Command Prompt, so that's expected. Winlogbeat is likely part of log management, and its FileCreate event doesn't look malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell executions with file manipulation scripts, some registry modifications, and unusual process activities. These could be signs of scripting for persistence or data exfiltration. The repeated use of powershell with specific command lines might indicate automated malicious activity or a test by an attacker. While not conclusive on their own, the combination makes the batch worth investigating to check if these actions are part of legitimate operations or potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with command-line arguments that modify file timestamps and create files in user directories. Suspicious activity includes registry modifications, repeated process launches, and the use of system DLLs by unusual processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from different processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and especially powershell.exe and chrome.exe. The tasks vary but many involve registry value sets and file creations.\n\nI notice that Calculator.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe both set registry values. That could be normal activity since these are common system processes. Powershell is also involved in a RegistryEvent and a FileCreate event for 'unidade_logico.txt'. Powershell can be used maliciously, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe majority of the events (13 out of 20) are from chrome.exe. These involve multiple registry writes and some image loads. The fact that chrome.exe is accessing various system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll might seem concerning, but these are legitimate Windows Defender components. Also, the repeated RegistryEvent tasks could be part of normal Chrome operation, like extension activities or updates.\n\nLooking at the file events: winlogbeat.exe created a config file, which makes sense if it's running for log collection. The powershell file creation is another point to consider, but again, without knowing the context of what's in 'unidade_logico.txt', it's not clear if it's malicious.\n\nI don't see any obvious signs of malware here. All activities seem to be within expected parameters for typical user actions and application behaviors. There are no unusual file paths or process interactions that raise red flags. The repetition might indicate something, but in this case, it's more likely standard operations rather than malicious behavior.\n\nSo, overall, the events don't suggest any suspicious activity that would warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as registry modifications and file creations from processes like chrome.exe and powershell.exe. These actions are typical for legitimate operations, including application updates or user actions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
