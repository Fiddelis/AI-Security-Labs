Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where different processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, winlogbeat.exe, whoami.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, chrome.exe, cmd.exe, and WMIC.exe are involved. The tasks include things like Registry value sets, Process accesses, Image loads, File creations, Process Creates, and Pipe events.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe appears several times with 'Process accessed' tasks. Powershell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be a vector for attacks because it's powerful and commonly blocked by security tools. The fact that it's accessing processes multiple times might indicate some automated script or potential malicious activity trying to hide.\n\nThen there are cmd.exe events with command lines that delete notepad.exe processes. This seems suspicious because deleting processes could be part of an attack to cover tracks or disrupt legitimate operations. Using wmic.exe to delete processes is another red flag, as WMIC can be used for remote commands and is often associated with malicious activities in logs.\n\nLooking at the svchost.exe entries: they're setting registry values multiple times. Svchost is a common process that hosts system services, but too many registry modifications could indicate a service being loaded or modified by something malicious trying to persist on the system.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a file might be normal if it's part of log shipping or management, but without more context, it's hard to say. The whoami.exe command line seems straightforward—it's used to get user information, which is usually legitimate unless it's being used in an unexpected way.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe setting registry values are a bit unusual. These processes are typically for UI components, so modifying the registry could be part of some configuration but might also signal malicious activity trying to install or change system settings.\n\nThe chrome.exe events with Pipe Created and Registry value sets are normal as Chrome often interacts with such resources, especially for extensions or plugins. But it's worth noting that if there were unusual behavior beyond standard operations, it might raise more flags.\n\nIn summary, while some of these activities could be legitimate (like using powershell for scripting, chrome's regular operations), the combination of multiple process creations and deletions involving cmd.exe and WMIC, along with several registry modifications from various processes, suggests potential malicious behavior. The repeated attempts to modify or delete processes might indicate an attack in progress, such as a kill-switch for other malware or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is a false positive due to legitimate system administration, but the frequency and combination of these events make me lean towards classifying them as interesting for further investigation. There's enough concerning activity that could point to malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including process creations, deletions, registry modifications, and potential use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with command-line arguments suggesting possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is WMIC.exe loading a file from Windows Defender. That seems suspicious because WMIC isn't typically used for legitimate processes, and loading an OAV.dll could indicate something malicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of notepad.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, and schtasks.exe performing registry writes and other actions. These activities alone aren't necessarily bad, but the frequency and combination might be concerning.\n\nI notice that cmd.exe is used to copy a file (sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe) which could be replacing system binaries, often done by malware to maintain persistence. Also, deleting scheduled tasks via schtasks might be an attempt to remove traces or disable security features.\n\nPowerShell is being accessed multiple times without clear legitimate use, especially with registry writes. This is a red flag because PowerShell can execute malicious scripts.\n\nPutting it all together, the events show unauthorized file replacements, deletion of system files, and extensive registry modifications—activities that are often part of an attack chain like persistence, privilege escalation, or lateral movement.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including potential file replacement and unauthorized process creations indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's start by understanding what each part of the JSONL data represents.\n\nFirst, I see that there are multiple entries, each with \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" fields. The \"process\" field usually tells me which executable is running, and the \"winlog\" gives details about the specific event or task that was triggered. The \"file\" field sometimes points to a file path if it's relevant.\n\nLooking at the first entry: process is schtasks.exe with an ImageLoad event for taskschd.dll. That seems normal because schtasks is related to scheduled tasks, and taskschd.dll is part of Windows Task Scheduler. So that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, I see svchost.exe, which is a common system process but sometimes used by malware. However, the event here is about a registry object being added or deleted. That could indicate some changes to the system's configuration, which might be normal or malicious depending on context.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Both of these are legitimate tools but can also be misused by attackers. For example, cmd.exe with command lines like \"\/c\" is a red flag because it suggests executing a command and then terminating the shell, which can be used to hide processes or execute malicious scripts.\n\nI notice that several entries have RegistryEvent tasks, specifically about values being set or registry objects modified. This could indicate an attacker trying to modify system settings, install persistent malware, or change configurations to avoid detection. Malware often uses the Windows Registry for persistence, so repeated changes here are concerning.\n\nThe whoami.exe process shows up a couple of times with command lines pointing to its own path. Whoami is typically used to get user information, but when executed without any unusual arguments, it might not be suspicious on its own. However, if it's being called by another malicious process, that could be part of an attack chain.\n\nAnother point is the multiple entries for powershell.exe with various tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers because it can execute commands, download files, or access system information. The repeated use without clear legitimate context raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\n\nLooking at chrome.exe entries: one loads amsi.dll, which is related to Microsoft's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. That might be normal if Chrome is accessing it for some security feature, but sometimes attackers can abuse such modules. Another entry with MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender could indicate legitimate behavior or an attempt to mimic defender processes.\n\nI also notice that cmd.exe is being used with \"\/c\" in the command line multiple times. This suggests a pattern of using command-line tools in a way that's often associated with scripting or automated tasks, which can be part of malicious activities like dropping files or executing other commands.\n\nOverall, while individual events might look benign, the combination raises some flags. The repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with potentially suspicious command lines, along with multiple registry modifications, suggests possible malicious behavior. These could be indicators of an attacker trying to establish persistence, gather information, or execute commands on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with potential command-line activities, along with registry modifications, suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That's pretty normal because it's a standard command-line tool used to get user information. Nothing suspicious here, I think.\n\nNext, there are multiple events related to powershell.exe. The first one shows that PowerShell accessed something. Then another event where it set a registry value. Registry modifications can be tricky; they could be part of legitimate scripting or signs of malicious activity. But on their own, they might not be enough to raise an alarm.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are standard parts of the .NET framework that PowerShell relies on, so those seem normal.\n\nThen, I notice a file creation event for a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1 in the Temp directory. This filename looks auto-generated, possibly from some automated testing or script execution. But it's not immediately suspicious unless there's more context about what the script does.\n\nAlmost immediately after creating this file, another event shows that it was deleted. File creation followed by deletion can be part of a script cleanup process or could indicate something malicious trying to remove evidence. However, without seeing the content of the script, it's hard to tell. But considering the other events, maybe it's related to testing script policy.\n\nThere are several \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events for powershell.exe. These seem like normal PowerShell operations as it starts up or shuts down components. Not a red flag on their own.\n\nThe last few events include another file creation of a .yml configuration file by winlogbeat.exe, which is likely part of some log management setup, and pipe creation events in PowerShell, which could be for communication between processes but aren't inherently malicious without more context.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell activity, including script execution, DLL loading, file operations, and process lifecycle events. While some actions could potentially be indicators of compromise (like script execution or file deletions), they don't provide enough evidence on their own to classify as malicious. It's possible that this is just routine administrative tasks or legitimate scripting activities.\n\nHowever, the repeated use of PowerShell commands and the creation\/deletion of a script in the Temp directory might warrant closer monitoring. The confidence level is moderate because while some actions are concerning, they don't clearly indicate malicious behavior without additional context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation and deletion of a script in the Temp directory, which could indicate potential malicious behavior or testing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

The logs are in JSONL format, each line being a JSON object.\n\nFirst, I notice that many events involve powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used by both admins and attackers, so it's something to watch. However, not all powershell use is malicious—it could be legitimate admin tasks or automated scripts.\n\nLooking at the details:\n\n1. Some entries show ImageLoad events for various DLLs like MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll. These are standard Windows components, so that doesn't seem suspicious on their own.\n\n2. There are FileCreate events in user-specific directories (like AppData). Creating files could be normal, but it's worth noting if these files are unusual or created by non-user processes.\n\n3. Multiple RegistryEvent tasks—setting registry values can indicate configuration changes. Malware might set certain keys for persistence, but again, admins often do this too.\n\n4. Process Create and Access events involving whoami.exe and repeated powershell commands with exit conditions based on file paths. The command lines are long and seem to check for the existence of specific batch files. This behavior looks like it's testing whether certain scripts exist before proceeding. That could be part of legitimate script execution or possibly a way to avoid detection by checking if malicious scripts are present.\n\n5. Notably, several events involve the same PowerShell command structure with exit conditions. The repetitive nature and the specific paths mentioned (like \"modulo_base_script.bat\") might suggest some automated checking or perhaps an attempt to see if certain files exist as part of a larger script execution process.\n\nPutting it all together: While individual events aren't necessarily suspicious, the combination is concerning. The repeated use of PowerShell with exit conditions based on file existence could indicate an adversary trying to execute malicious scripts only if they're present, avoiding detection. This pattern suggests potential malicious activity, especially since multiple such events are logged.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with exit conditions based on file existence checks suggest potential malicious script execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial events, I see multiple entries where PowerShell is loading different DLL files. The 'Image loaded' tasks are occurring several times with various file paths. That in itself might not be suspicious because PowerShell often loads these modules when running scripts or commands.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created and immediately deleted. The file path points to a temporary location, which seems like it could be part of script execution testing permissions. This might indicate some kind of script activity, possibly checking if certain files exist before proceeding. But again, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nNext, there are several events from Chrome.exe modifying the registry. That doesn't stand out too much since legitimate applications often make registry changes during operation or updates. However, multiple registry writes could be a red flag, but I'd need more information about what exactly was changed.\n\nAnother event shows PowerShell creating a file in the 'Downloads' folder. This might be part of normal script execution, saving data there. But again, without knowing the content of the file, it's hard to assess risk here.\n\nThere are two events where the command line is obfuscated with long paths containing \"&\" symbols and if-else statements. This kind of command-line argument is typical for executing PowerShell scripts, but the use of \"&\" can sometimes be a way to hide malicious commands or bypass certain security checks. The fact that these are executed via the command line might raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file created related to 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. This could be normal PowerShell profile initialization, especially if the script is non-interactive. But it's worth noting as it indicates some level of configuration or setup being done by the script.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the batch shows significant activity from PowerShell executing various operations and Chrome making registry changes. The combination of file creation\/deletion in temp folders, image loading, and command-line obfuscation might suggest that something is being tested or set up on the system. While some activities are normal, others, like the script testing for file existence and the obfuscated command lines, could indicate potential malicious behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because while individual events may not be suspicious, the overall pattern—especially the PowerShell activity and temporary file handling—could be part of a larger malicious process.

The first event shows that a new item is being created and then some content is being set in specific paths using Set-Content. That catches my attention because creating files or modifying existing ones can be part of malicious activities, especially if it's done with some obfuscation.\n\nI notice that the command lines are somewhat similar but have different file paths each time. This pattern suggests that something might be iterating over multiple directories to drop files. The fact that they're using PowerShell is also a red flag because attackers often use this tool for its scripting capabilities and to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the events, after the initial process creation (Process Create), there are subsequent tasks like accessing processes, modifying registry values, and loading images. This sequence can be indicative of lateral movement or establishing persistence within the system. The repeated ImageLoad events might mean that powershell.exe is loading various components or modules, which could be malicious in nature.\n\nThe file paths mentioned seem to be targeting different parts of the filesystem, like 'modulo_secundario' and 'estrutura_auxiliar', which don't ring any bells as standard system directories. This makes me think these are custom or crafted paths likely used for specific purposes, possibly to store malicious scripts or tools.\n\nAlso, all events involve powershell.exe, which is a common vector for attacks. The use of the Registry value set task indicates potential changes to system configurations, maybe adding registry keys for persistence. Combined with the file modifications, this could be part of installing a backdoor or dropping a payload.\n\nAnother point is that there are multiple similar events with varying paths. This might indicate an attempt to create multiple scripts across different directories, possibly trying to evade detection by spreading out files. It's also possible that each script is performing a small part of the attack, like creating batch files that execute directory listings, which could be stepping stones for further actions.\n\nOverall, while I can't be 100% certain without more context, the combination of process creation, file modifications in unusual paths, and repeated registry access with powershell.exe makes this batch of events look suspicious. It definitely warrants a closer look to see if any of these activities are part of an active attack or malicious campaign.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes creating and modifying files across various paths, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The events are in JSONL format, each line is a separate event.\n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of these events involve 'powershell.exe'. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate scripting and for malicious activities like executing commands and scripts. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is creating files and registry entries. For example:\n\n- Event 1: Powershell creates a new file with .bat extension using the command line, which might indicate script execution.\n- Events 2-3: Creation and deletion of temporary PS1 files. Temporary script files can be used to execute malicious code temporarily to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the tasks in WinLog:\n- There are several 'File created' events (rule: FileCreate), suggesting new files are being written.\n- Registry value sets (rule: RegistryEvent) could indicate persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations for malicious purposes.\n- Pipe Created events might be used for communication between processes, which can be a sign of command and control activities.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where 'conhost.exe' accesses the registry. Conhost is often associated with running PowerShell scripts in certain environments. Combined with the other powershell.exe activities, it raises suspicion.\n\nThe process creation and access events (Process Create, ProcessAccess) could be part of a larger attack chain, such as creating processes to execute code or accessing existing processes for lateral movement.\n\nAnother point is the multiple ImageLoad events. These indicate that PowerShell is loading various DLLs, which is normal, but in combination with other activities, it might suggest unusual behavior or attempts to load malicious components.\n\nConsidering all these together: repeated powershell.exe commands creating files and registry entries, temporary script file handling, process creation, and image loading could be indicative of a script execution, potentially malicious. However, without knowing the exact context (like whether this is part of routine admin tasks), it's hard to be certain. But given the volume and nature of these events, there's enough cause for concern.\n\nI would classify this batch as INTERESTING due to the suspicious combination of PowerShell activities, file creation, registry modifications, and potential script execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell.exe events including file creations, registry changes, and process activity which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nFirst, I notice that several events involve powershell.exe being executed with command lines that check for the existence of certain .bat files. The paths in these commands are a bit long and have some unusual folder names like \"modulo_secundario\" and \"registro_logico\". I'm not sure if those are standard directories or not, but they look crafted. Also, the fact that they're checking for specific batch scripts might indicate something malicious, like ensuring certain files exist before proceeding.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created in the user's Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1\". That looks temporary and unusual. Creating a script file in the Temp folder could be part of executing some malicious code, especially since it's using PowerShell. Even more concerning is that after creating this file, there's an event where it's deleted. This might be to avoid detection or to clean up evidence.\n\nAnother point is the Image loaded events for MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. These are legitimate files, so maybe not suspicious on their own, but combined with other actions, they could be part of a process that's trying to appear benign.\n\nThere's also an event where a user is accessing their profile data in the PowerShell startup folder. While this can be normal, it might indicate that some configuration is being altered or read, which could be part of setting up persistence for malicious activities.\n\nThe last few events include creating a file in a specific directory and interacting with the registry and other processes. Registry writes are common but could also be used to set up malicious scripts or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of PowerShell activities: checking for files, creating temporary script files, deleting them quickly, and accessing system components like Defender and the registry. These behaviors don't fit typical user activity and could indicate an attempt at executing unauthorized code or exfiltration.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of these events suggests potential malicious behavior.

That seems normal because whoami is often used to get user information and isn't inherently malicious, but I should keep that in mind as part of the context.\n\nNext, a powershell.exe process is accessed. Powershell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so I need to see what it's doing. The command lines for several events show if statements checking the existence of specific files. For example, \"if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\pacote_principal\\\\objeto_base\\\\estrutura_secundario\\\\bin\\\\entrada_base.exe\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This looks like a script that's testing whether certain files exist and exiting based on that.\n\nI notice multiple similar events with different file paths being checked. This repetition could indicate either legitimate scripting or part of an attack, like checking if payload files are present before proceeding. If this were a malicious script, it might be trying to ensure necessary components are in place before executing harmful actions.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where powershell.exe sets a registry value. That's another red flag because attackers often modify the registry to persistence their malware or change system configurations.\n\nAlso, several events show image loads of various DLLs by powershell.exe.

The repeated attempts to access specific files could indicate an attacker checking for successful payload delivery or verifying environment before deploying further actions.\n\nThe whoami.exe at the beginning might just be a legitimate user command, but in combination with the powershell activities, it's part of a broader pattern that raises suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell accessing and checking for specific files, combined with registry modifications, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break down each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of the events involve powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be abused for malicious activities. That's a red flag because attackers often use it to execute scripts or commands.\n\nLooking at the specific actions:\n- There are multiple instances where files are being created and deleted in temporary directories, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\. This is suspicious because attackers might create temp files for malicious purposes.\n- The file paths mentioned include MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. It's odd that these specific DLLs are being loaded by PowerShell. Legitimate use would typically involve Defender components, but in this case, it seems out of place, especially combined with other actions.\n\nI also see several registry value sets. Malware often modifies the registry to persist or gain access, so this could indicate malicious behavior.\n- The process accesses and interacts with other processes, which can be a sign of lateral movement within a network. If an attacker is trying to move between systems, they might use such techniques.\n\nAdditionally, there are commands checking for the existence of files in certain directories (like Test-Path in PowerShell). This could be part of a script verifying if specific binaries exist, possibly to ensure they can execute further malicious code.\n- The cmd.exe and whoami.exe processes also stand out. While these tools are common, their use alongside powershell.exe might suggest an attacker is checking permissions or system info.\n\nPutting it all together:\n1. Excessive powershell.exe activity with file creation\/deletion in temp directories.\n2. Loading of specific Defender DLLs which doesn't align with standard operations.\n3. Registry modifications that could enable persistence or privilege escalation.\n4. File existence checks and process interactions indicative of malicious scripts.\n5. Use of cmd.exe and whoami.exe alongside powershell.exe, possibly for reconnaissance or lateral movement.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows signs of potential malicious activity.

The first thing that stands out is the extensive use of PowerShell.exe processes across multiple events. Now, PowerShell itself isn't inherently bad, but its misuse can be a red flag for malicious activities.\n\nLooking deeper, there are several instances where PowerShell is being executed with command lines. Each command line seems to check if certain files exist in specific directories. For example, one command checks if \"C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\estrutura_comum\\src\\estrutura_temporario.cs\" exists and exits with 0 or 1 accordingly. This pattern repeats across multiple events with different file paths.\n\nI'm wondering why someone would need to repeatedly check the existence of these files. Legitimate uses might include scripts verifying necessary components are present, but in this case, it's concerning because the same script-like checks are happening multiple times. The repetition could indicate a script being run several times, which isn't typical for normal operations unless part of a deployment process.\n\nAnother point is that each command ends with an exit code based on the file's presence. This behavior might be part of a larger script designed to execute certain actions only if specific files exist. However, without context, it's hard to say if this is legitimate or not.\n\nThe logs also show multiple 'Process Create' and 'Image Load' events related to PowerShell.exe, which can be normal but could also be signs of a process being used maliciously. Additionally, there are entries where the task is labeled as 'Provider Lifecycle', which might relate to how certain services or components are being managed.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual actions might not be suspicious, the combination—especially the repetitive file checks using PowerShell—raises flags. This behavior could be part of a data exfiltration attempt, ensuring files exist before acting on them, or perhaps preparing for an attack by checking for necessary conditions.\n\nGiven that there are seven events where PowerShell is being executed with these specific checks, and multiple instances where it's accessing the system, I'm leaning towards this batch being interesting from a security standpoint. The repeated nature of the commands and the use of exit codes based on file existence could indicate testing or probing behavior, which might be malicious.\n\nSo, after considering all these factors, I classify this batch as 'INTERESTING' with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes with specific command lines checking file existence could indicate potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

This could be used to check user permissions or gather information about the current user. Combined with the PowerShell activities, this might suggest some form of user privilege checking or lateral movement.\n\nI'm concerned because several of these events involve creating and deleting files in temporary directories, which are common tactics for malware to avoid detection. The repeated checks for specific script files could be part of a larger payload deployment or testing phase.\n\nAdditionally, the registry value set event (line 9) stands out. Modifying the registry is another common indicator of malicious activity, as attackers often try to persistence their access or alter system configurations.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a pattern of behavior that could be indicative of an attacker probing the system, testing for vulnerabilities, or preparing to execute further commands. The combination of file operations, process creation, and registry modifications is concerning.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is definitely malicious because some of these actions can also be legitimate, especially script-related tasks. However, the frequency and specific paths involved raise red flags. My confidence level is around 0.75 that this batch might indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation, deletion, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior or system probing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of PowerShell processes being started. The command lines have these 'if' statements checking for the existence of specific .ps1 files and exiting based on that. That seems odd because it looks like they're testing whether those scripts are present before proceeding. Maybe the script is trying to avoid execution if certain conditions aren't met, which could indicate something malicious.\n\nThere are multiple events with similar command lines but different paths. For example, one checks \"C:\\registro_base\\entrada_base\\objeto_principal\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" and another checks \"C:\\tarefa_temporario\\componente_padrao\\entrada_geral\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". This repetition suggests that the script is being tested across different locations, possibly trying to locate or download it.\n\nI notice several 'Registry value set' events. Malware often modifies the registry to persist itself or gain privileges. Also, there are multiple 'Image loaded' tasks loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are common for .NET framework processes but might indicate something more if they're being used maliciously.\n\nThere's a file creation event of \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1\" followed immediately by its deletion. This behavior is suspicious because creating a script just to delete it could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or test permissions without leaving evidence.\n\nAnother point is the 'Pipe Created' event, which might allow communication between different processes. If this pipe is used inappropriately, it can facilitate command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nThe use of multiple paths with \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" suggests that the attacker is trying to execute a script designed to capture keystrokes or perform other malicious activities. The repeated checks imply they're ensuring the script exists before proceeding, possibly to avoid detection or ensure their tools are in place.\n\nLooking at the overall activity, it seems like there's an attempt to run scripts that could be malicious, especially with activities related to file creation\/deletion and registry modifications. This combination makes me confident that this batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes check for the existence of potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), modify system configurations, and exhibit file creation\/deletion patterns indicative of script execution attempts.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe accessing processes, creating files, and interacting with the registry. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated access could be a red flag. But I need to check if these actions are normal or suspicious.\n\nNext, whoami.exe was run twice. This tool is often used by attackers to gather information about the system's user context, which might indicate reconnaissance activity.\n\nThere are also several entries from svchost.exe accessing the registry and making network connections. SvcHost is a common process for running services, but it's sometimes exploited by malware to hide malicious activities. The repeated registry changes could be suspicious.\n\nI noticed some legitimate processes like notepad.exe and calc.exe loading system files, which seems normal unless they're being used in an unusual way.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file might be related to log management, possibly part of the monitoring setup, so that's probably benign.\n\nLooking at Chrome, there are multiple network connections and DNS queries. While this is typical for a browser, especially when accessing websites, the sheer number could indicate something malicious like data exfiltration or botnet activity.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of powershell.exe activity, whoami.exe runs, svchost.exe registry modifications, and extensive Chrome network traffic suggests potential malicious behavior. These activities don't seem to be part of normal user operations and could indicate an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes, whoami.exe being executed, svchost.exe making registry changes, and extensive network connections from chrome.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where powershell.exe is being executed with specific command lines. The commands include things like \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\", which look like they're listing files recursively across directories. That could be legitimate for an admin checking system info, but it's also common in attacks to gather information about the system.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe is being called multiple times with similar command lines. The fact that it's invoking scripts and loading various .dlls (like mscoree.dll and others) makes me think of potential malicious activities. Attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for their actions because they're more likely to go unnoticed.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of a temporary script file in C:\\Users\\... which was created and then deleted shortly after. This behavior could be an attempt to execute code without leaving a trace on disk, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity. The file path looks suspicious too, with \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" in the filename.\n\nThere's also a pipe created by powershell.exe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, but in the context of PowerShell scripts, this could be part of a larger attack chain, such as creating a persistence mechanism or communicating with other processes.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where whoami.exe was executed, which is commonly used to check user permissions. While innocent on its own, combined with the other powershell activities, it might indicate an attacker trying to escalate privileges or gather user information.\n\nThe repetitive nature of these log entries suggests that someone is running a script multiple times, possibly testing for vulnerabilities or deploying malicious code. The use of multiple registry accesses and file operations further supports this suspicion, as attackers often interact with the registry to hide their presence or modify system configurations.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated powershell executions with file enumeration commands, creation\/deletion of temp scripts, registry modifications, and pipe creation. All these factors point towards potential malicious behavior rather than normal user activity. The combination makes the batch interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious command lines, file operations, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
