{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because browsers do that frequently when browsing the web. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, I see several powershell.exe processes being created or accessing other processes. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be a vector for malicious activities. The fact that it's accessed multiple times and there are registry modifications might raise an eyebrow because attackers often use such tools for persistence or to execute commands.\n\nThen, cmd.exe appears a few times with specific command lines. One of them runs 'dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key' and then pipes it through findstr looking for '.key'. This is interesting because .key files are typically associated with encryption keys, like those used by ransomware. The command seems to be searching for such files in the root directory. If an attacker is looking for sensitive files, this could indicate reconnaissance or planning for an attack.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process which is usually harmless but can sometimes be part of privilege escalation attempts when used with specific flags or combined with other actions. Here, it seems isolated, so maybe not too concerning on its own.\n\nConhost.exe accessing the registry might be part of legitimate processes, as it's often related to console windows. But in combination with other events, it could warrant closer look.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation events from winlogbeat.exe which is likely a log shipping tool. These don't seem suspicious unless they're creating files in unexpected locations or with unusual names.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell and cmd accessing the registry, combined with the command searching for .key files, suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated attempts to create processes and modify the registry could be signs of an attacker trying to establish persistence or gather information. Therefore, this batch is interesting enough to investigate further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity: Powershell accessing processes, cmd.exe searching for .key files, and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are two instances where `winlogbeat.exe` created a file. That seems normal because winlogbeat is likely just setting up or updating its configuration file. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, multiple processes like `RuntimeBroker.exe`, `notepad.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and others show registry value sets. These are common system activities since many legitimate processes interact with the Windows Registry for configuration. So far, nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nThen, I see `powershell.exe` accessing a process. PowerShell is often used maliciously, but in this case, it's just accessing another process. Without more context like command-line arguments or file modifications, this doesn't raise red flags.\n\nThe `calc.exe` event loads `urlmon.dll`, which is a standard Windows DLL for URL handling. No issues there.\n\nLooking further, `Calculator.exe` also loads `urlmon.dll`. This seems normal as part of its operation.\n\nThere are several instances where `chrome.exe` is involved in registry events and loading system DLLs like `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll`. These activities are typical for a browser process to interact with system components and security modules. No signs of malicious behavior here.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they don't show any anomalies or unusual patterns that would indicate malicious activity. Most actions are standard Windows operations performed by legitimate processes.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of normal system activities such as file creation, registry modifications, and process loading of standard DLLs, with no indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of three events. Let me go through each one to see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities because it can execute commands and scripts. The fact that it's accessed here might raise an eyebrow, but sometimes admins use it for system management.\n\nNext, there's whoami.exe running. Whoami is a standard Windows utility to display user information. It's usually not suspicious on its own unless used in a way that's part of a larger attack chain, like gathering credentials.\n\nThe third event again shows powershell.exe being accessed. This repetition makes me think maybe someone is trying to do multiple things with PowerShell, perhaps attempting to execute commands or scripts. The combination could indicate an attempt at command execution or lateral movement within the network.\n\nI'm also considering the sequence of events. Powershell running after whoami might suggest a process where initial access was gained using whoami (maybe for reconnaissance) and then escalated using powershell for more malicious purposes, like downloading additional tools or scripts.\n\nHowever, since these are separate processes and no other indicators like file creations or network activity are present, it's hard to say definitively. But the repeated use of powershell.exe could be a sign of potential malicious behavior, especially if the environment isn't known for frequent PowerShell usage.\n\nSo overall, while not conclusive, the combination does raise some red flags that warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and whoami.exe running. The repetition of powershell.exe access may indicate potential malicious activity or script execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
