Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is Chrome making a DNS query. That's normal for browsing, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, PowerShell sets a registry value. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate scripts but could also indicate malicious activity. I'll keep this in mind.\n\nThen, cmd.exe runs systeminfo and reg query. These commands are often used by attackers to gather system info and look for sensitive data. This might be concerning.\n\nAnother PowerShell event where it accesses a process. Accessing processes can be part of legitimate scripts but could also be malicious if done without proper permissions or in an unusual context.\n\nThere's another cmd.exe setting registry values, which adds to the suspicion about potential unauthorized changes.\n\nSysteminfo.exe is run and loads AMSI.DLL and MpOAV.DLL. These are known for anti-malware components, so maybe someone is trying to disable them? That could be malicious.\n\nNotepad.exe modifying the registry—uncommon but possible if running scripts. Could indicate an attempt to create persistence or change system settings.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll—calc isn't typically associated with such activity. Maybe it's a test or something else.\n\n_svhost.exe is involved in multiple events, both setting registry values and creating files. svchost is a legitimate process but often used by malware for hiding activities. The repeated registry changes could be malicious.\n\nWmiPrvSE.exe is started with specific parameters. This is related to WMI, which can be misused by attackers for remote command execution or persistence. The fact that it's created without any visible interface might be suspicious.\n\nConhost.exe modifying the registry—again, not a typical process for such actions unless part of a script or malicious activity.\n\nServices.exe and Special Logon events are standard during system operations, so probably not an issue.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes accessing sensitive areas like the registry and WMI, which could be signs of potential malware. The use of command-line tools in unusual ways adds to the suspicion. While some activities could be legitimate, the combination raises red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity such as registry modifications, process creations with suspicious commands, and file operations by uncommon processes like WmiPrvSE.exe and svchost.exe. These activities could be part of an attack chain.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's break this down. I'm looking at a batch of system log events, each in JSONL format. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **winlogbeat.exe** created a file: This looks normal since winlogbeat is likely capturing logs and creating files.\n2. ApplicationFrameHost.exe set a registry value: Registry changes are common, especially for system processes.\n3. powershell.exe set a registry value: Powershell is often used by admins but can be malicious if the script is bad.\n4. Another powershell.exe event accessing process info: This could be legitimate admin activity or something more nefarious.\n5. chrome.exe created a pipe and set registry values: Chrome often creates pipes for communication, so this seems normal.\n6. Calculator.exe set a registry value: Again, common system interactions, not suspicious on its own.\n\nI notice that many events are from chrome.exe setting registry values repeatedly. That's unusual because regular browsing doesn't require frequent registry modifications. Also, the powershell.exe events accessing processes and creating files could indicate malicious activity, like persistence mechanisms or dropping files.\n\nThe repeated RegistryEvent tasks by Chrome might be a red flag. Malware sometimes uses legitimate tools to mask its activities. Plus, the FileCreate task from winlogbeat and powershell writing a file named 'objeto_padrao.txt' is worth checking if this file is associated with known malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities, especially concerning Powershell and Chrome making multiple registry changes. This combination could suggest possible malicious behavior needing investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple RegistryEvent tasks by chrome.exe may indicate potential malicious activity. Additionally, powershell.exe accessing process information and creating a file named 'objeto_padrao.txt' raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this JSONL data where each line is a separate event. The first event shows that chrome.exe modified the Windows event log with a task related to setting a registry value. That's pretty common for software updates or changes.\n\nThe second event again mentions chrome.exe and another task about a RegistryEvent, but it doesn't specify details like key names or values. Without knowing what exactly was changed, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nSince each event on its own isn't alarming enough, I'm considering the batch as a whole. If these were part of legitimate updates or user actions, they wouldn't be suspicious. There's no indication of multiple failed attempts, unusual access times, or other red flags.\n\nSo, putting it all together, there's not enough evidence to suggest malicious activity. The events are probably just regular system changes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate process activities with no indication of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
