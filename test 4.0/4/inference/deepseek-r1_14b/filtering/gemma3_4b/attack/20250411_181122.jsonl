Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That's a common tool used to find out user information. Not inherently suspicious on its own unless there's something else indicating misuse.\n\nNext, I see multiple events related to powershell.exe. Powershell can be both legitimate and malicious because it has powerful scripting capabilities. Let me look closer at these events.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the process events: \"powershell.exe & {findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls\\nls -R | select-string -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Pattern password}\". This looks like a script that's searching for files with certain extensions containing 'pass' and then looking for 'password'. This is concerning because it might indicate an attempt to find sensitive information, which could be part of data exfiltration or unauthorized access.\n\nAlso, there are several events where powershell.exe accesses the registry and creates files. The file creation and deletion in \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\" suggests that a script is being written and then deleted. This might be an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving long traces, or it could be part of legitimate scripting.\n\nThe events where powershell.exe loads various .NET framework components are normal when running scripts that use .NET. However, combined with the other activities, they raise suspicion.\n\nAdditionally, multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events for powershell.exe might indicate the script is trying to run in different contexts or modules, which could be a way to avoid detection or persist across sessions.\n\nConsidering all these together—the search for password-related strings, temporary file creation\/deletion, and repeated process activities—this batch shows behavior that's indicative of potential malicious activity. The confidence level is high because the command line arguments are clearly attempting to locate sensitive information.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show PowerShell executing a script searching for 'password' in files, which may indicate data exfiltration or unauthorized access.

Let me go through each one carefully.\n\nFirst event: It's a PowerShell process with a command line that includes \"findstr\" searching for keywords like 'pass' across various file types. That seems suspicious because it looks like it's trying to find sensitive information in files, which could be part of an attack or data exfiltration.\n\nSecond event: Winlogbeat.exe creating a new config file. That's normal if you're using log management tools, so probably not malicious.\n\nThird: Notepad.exe setting a registry value. Not sure why Notepad would modify the registry, but maybe it's legitimate, though unusual.\n\nFourth: Another PowerShell process accessing something. Since PowerShell is often used by attackers, any instance could be concerning, especially if combined with other events.\n\nFifth: Calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a system file, so not suspicious on its own.\n\nSixth: Powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. Again, Defender is legitimate, but seeing PowerShell interact with it might warrant attention.\n\nSeventh: Similar to the first event, another instance of the same PowerShell command line. This repetition could indicate automated malicious activity.\n\nEighth and ninth: Svchost.exe modifying registry values. Svchost is a common process for services, so unless there's unusual activity, this isn't too bad on its own.\n\nTenth: Findstr.exe being executed with specific search parameters again. Another data-mining attempt, likely part of an attack chain.\n\nEleventh to fifteenth: Various processes accessing or creating files\/registry entries. Some are normal (like OfficeClickToRun), others like multiple registry writes by PowerShell might be concerning.\n\nSixteenth to twentieth: Chrome.exe events seem normal unless they're interacting with malicious URLs, but the logs don't show that.\n\nLooking at all these together, I notice a lot of activity involving PowerShell and findstr searching for sensitive terms. Multiple instances of similar commands suggest persistence or data gathering. The combination of registry modifications by PowerShell could indicate an attempt to maintain access or alter system configurations. While some events are benign on their own, the pattern across multiple entries raises red flags about potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity searching for sensitive information in various file types, combined with registry modifications and other potentially malicious process interactions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. First, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nMost events are from chrome.exe performing tasks like setting registry values, making DNS queries, loading images, and establishing network connections. These activities seem normal for a web browser. Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings, accesses DNS servers for domain lookups, loads DLLs for functionality, and connects to networks as part of browsing.\n\nThere are also events from winlogbeat.exe creating files, which is expected since it's an agent that likely logs system activity. The creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new seems routine for configuration updates.\n\nA notable event is powershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be malicious. However, without more context about the content or execution path of this file, it's hard to say if it's suspicious. It could be part of a script running as part of normal operations.\n\nThe repeated registry writes and network connections by chrome.exe don't raise red flags on their own since they're typical behaviors for a browser, especially when dealing with multiple tabs or active plugins.\n\nI'm also considering whether the frequency of events is unusual. There are quite a few entries from chrome.exe, but it's plausible if the system was in use heavily during that time, running multiple extensions or accessing several websites.\n\nLooking at all events together, there doesn't seem to be a pattern indicating malicious activity like failed login attempts, access to restricted files, or异常的进程行为. The only slightly concerning point is the creation of a file by powershell.exe, but without additional context, it's not conclusive.\n\nTherefore, while I can't rule out any possibility entirely, the batch doesn't present clear signs of malicious behavior that would require immediate investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist mostly of normal user activity from Chrome.exe and routine operations by winlogbeat.exe. PowerShell creating a file isn't suspicious without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's see what each event is telling me.\n\nFirst off, there are multiple entries involving 'powershell.exe', which is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. PowerShell can execute scripts and commands, so seeing it in logs is something to pay attention to. But not all PowerShell usage is bad—it depends on the context.\n\nLooking at the first event: 'powershell.exe' created a file named 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. Creating files with PowerShell could be part of data collection or writing malicious scripts. The filename doesn't immediately ring alarms, but it's something to note.\n\nNext, there are several entries where 'winlogbeat.exe' creates files related to its own configuration. This seems normal if winlogbeat is a monitoring tool installed on the system. It's probably logging events for legitimate purposes, so this by itself isn't suspicious.\n\nThen I see multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' accessing processes and modifying registry values. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure it runs at startup or survives reboots. The fact that these are happening repeatedly in the logs could indicate some automated process, possibly malicious.\n\nThere's also a command using schtasks.exe to delete scheduled tasks. Schtasks is a legitimate Windows tool for managing scheduled tasks. However, deleting tasks without proper authorization might be part of an attack aiming to remove competing malware or disrupt system operations. The command lines show specific task names being deleted, which might not align with standard administrative procedures.\n\nAnother point is the use of 'cmd.exe' in various commands. For example, using cmd to execute schtasks and wmic commands could be part of script execution. While cmd is a common tool, its misuse can indicate malicious activity, especially when combined with other tools like PowerShell and schtasks.\n\nI notice that some processes are creating or accessing registry keys. Registry changes can be indicators of malicious activities such as installing backdoors or altering system configurations to enable persistence. The fact that 'svchost.exe' is involved in these actions is a bit concerning because it's often used by malware due to its legitimate functions and ability to hide malicious processes.\n\nThere are also entries where 'whoami.exe' is run, which typically retrieves user information. While innocent on its own, if used within the context of other suspicious activities, it might be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n\nThe variety of tools being used—PowerShell, cmd, schtasks, wmic—is a red flag. Attackers often use multiple tools to obfuscate their tracks and perform different stages of an attack, like lateral movement, data exfiltration, or persistence.\n\nMoreover, the repetition of certain actions, such as accessing processes and modifying registry entries with PowerShell, suggests automation. This could be part of a script designed to perform malicious tasks at intervals or upon specific triggers.\n\nThe deletion of scheduled tasks using schtasks might indicate an attempt to remove competing malware or disrupt system monitoring tools. Alternatively, it could be part of an attack aimed at preventing the system from recovering automatically, making manual intervention necessary.\n\nTaking all these events together, there are several indicators that point towards potential malicious activity. The combination of multiple high-risk tools, repeated process and registry access, file creation by PowerShell, and task deletion suggests a coordinated effort that's likely not benign. While some individual actions might seem normal, the pattern as a whole raises concerns about a possible attack or unauthorized system compromise.\n\nTherefore, this batch of logs is classified as interesting because it exhibits behaviors consistent with potential malicious activity, including the use of multiple tools for process creation, file manipulation, and registry changes, which could indicate an active threat.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or script execution.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving processes like WMIC.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, whoami.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe. WMIC is known for being able to execute commands remotely, which can be a red flag if used inappropriately. The command lines show things like deleting users, such as \"net user \/del\", which might indicate someone trying to remove accounts.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are several 'Registry value set' events, which could mean that something is modifying system settings or persistence mechanisms. Powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values without clear context might be suspicious because it's a powerful tool often used by attackers for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nThere are also entries where notepad.exe, conhost.exe, and cmd.exe are involved in registry changes or process creations. These seem out of the ordinary for these processes, which typically don't interact with the registry as part of their normal operations. This could be an attempt to hide malicious activities or create persistence points.\n\nThe events involving user deletions (like net.exe \/del) might indicate a cleanup phase after initial access, where attackers remove accounts they've compromised or created during the attack. Additionally, whoami.exe being used without clear context could be part of reconnaissance activities to gather system information.\n\nConsidering the combination of these events—use of WMIC for process deletion, multiple powershell.exe accesses with registry modifications, cmd.exe commands deleting users, and repeated use of net and net1 for user deletions—it's a pattern that suggests potential malicious activity. The repetitive nature of these actions across different processes strengthens the suspicion.\n\nI'm also noting that some entries have 'None' for process or file information, which might be incomplete logging but doesn't necessarily negate the concerns from other events. The variety of tools used and their activities collectively point towards possible unauthorized access or system compromise.\n\nIn summary, while each individual event might not immediately raise a red flag, together they form a concerning pattern that could indicate an active attack or malicious behavior on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including process creations and deletions (e.g., WMIC.exe, net.exe), registry modifications, and user account management which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see several entries where cmd.exe is being used with commands like net user \/del \/domain. That stands out because deleting a user account across the domain could be legitimate admin work or it might indicate an attacker trying to remove traces of their activity or perhaps preparing for further attacks. It's something that should definitely be looked into.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe and cmd.exe are accessing registry values. Powershell is often used in scripting, which can be malicious if it's part of a larger attack. The fact that they're modifying the registry repeatedly makes me suspicious because attackers often use the registry to hide their presence or create persistence points.\n\nLooking further, there are commands like sc delete win32times. That command is deleting a service named win32times. If I'm not mistaken, this might be related to some known malware that creates services for persistence. Deleting such a service could mean someone is trying to remove malicious components, which is another red flag.\n\nI also notice the use of whoami.exe being executed multiple times. While it's a standard command to check user permissions, repeated usage without clear context could indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts. It might be part of an attempt to gather information about the system.\n\nThe events involving services.exe modifying registry entries are concerning too. Services often interact with the registry, but the specific actions here don't seem typical of normal operations. This could be related to service creation or deletion for malicious purposes.\n\nConsidering all these points together: multiple process creations (cmd.exe, powershell.exe), registry modifications, user deletions, and service manipulations. These activities collectively suggest a potential attack chain involving initial access, lateral movement, and\/or data exfiltration. The repetitive use of certain commands and the types of processes involved are not typical of everyday user activity, making this batch highly suspicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because there's a pattern that suggests malicious behavior rather than normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creations (cmd.exe, powershell.exe) with commands indicating user deletions and service manipulations suggest potential malicious activity.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is cmd.exe deleting some files in the Temp directory. That seems suspicious because deleting files can be part of malicious activity like removing evidence. Next, there's a PowerShell process being accessed, which isn't immediately worrying on its own but could be used for bad things. Then another cmd.exe setting registry values and deleting a file. Registry changes are common in malware to maintain persistence.\n\nLooking further, I see whoami.exe running, which is usually harmless unless it's part of privilege escalation. There are multiple entries where PowerShell is accessed or created with an empty command line, which might be a red flag—empty commands can indicate attempts to hide malicious activity.\n\nSeveral events show images being loaded by PowerShell, like mscoree.dll and others. Those are legitimate .NET components, so that's not suspicious on its own. However, the repeated use of PowerShell without clear purpose is concerning. It could be part of a script or command execution sequence that's trying to hide or perform malicious actions.\n\nPutting it all together: cmd.exe deleting files, registry modifications, and multiple PowerShell processes with potentially empty commands suggest possible malicious activity.

It's a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously. The events show powershell.exe being executed multiple times. That's a red flag because attackers often use it.\n\nLooking deeper, there are file creations and deletions in temporary directories. For example, a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1 is created and then deleted. Temporary scripts can be part of malicious activities to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, the events mention registry changes and process accesses. These actions could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or escalate privileges. The whoami.exe executions might be used to gather system information, which is typical in early stages of an attack.\n\nThe combination of multiple PowerShell instances, file manipulations in temp folders, and registry modifications suggests potential malicious behavior.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are a couple of \"whoami.exe\" process creations. Whoami is typically used to get user information, but on its own, it might not be malicious unless it's part of some larger activity. It's common in scripts or legitimate processes.\n\nNext, I see multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell can do a lot, both good and bad. But again, just accessing it doesn't necessarily mean it's doing something nefarious. Maybe the user is running scripts or using it for system admin tasks.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe and Calculator.exe are standard Windows processes. RuntimeBroker is part of UWP app management, so that's normal. Calculator is a benign application, though in some cases, its execution could be monitored, but nothing suspicious here.\n\nThere are several Registry value sets by various processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, and others. Svchost is a common process for services, and modifying the registry isn't unusual unless it's done by an unexpected process or in bulk quickly.\n\nFile creation events from winlogbeat.exe seem related to log file handling. It looks like it's writing configuration files, which makes sense if it's an agent running to collect logs.\n\nLooking at calc.exe loading urlmon.dll is interesting because I know that legitimate processes sometimes load DLLs for various purposes. But in some cases, malicious actors might abuse standard tools by loading different modules. However, the presence of urlmon.dll in system32 is expected as it's part of Windows. So this might not be a red flag.\n\nThe Chrome events show DNS queries and network connections, which are typical behaviors for a browser accessing websites. Unless they're connecting to known malicious domains or making an unusual number of requests, this isn't concerning.\n\nPutting all these together, I don't see any clear signs of malicious activity like process creations with suspicious command lines, writes to unexpected files, or indicators of compromise.
