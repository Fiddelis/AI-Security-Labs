{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of Windows log events and need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed. Powershell can be legitimate but often used in attacks because it has scripting capabilities. The command line shows that some executions involve importing a PS1 script. That's a red flag because scripts can execute arbitrary code and might be malicious.\n\nLooking at the file events, I see that a PowerShell script was created and then deleted within a short time frame. This could indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies by creating a temporary file and deleting it before detection. Such behavior is often seen in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThere are also several ImageLoad events for various DLLs loaded by powershell.exe, which is normal but might be used for malicious activities if the scripts import libraries to hide or execute code.\n\nAnother point is that whoami.exe was run without any arguments. While this can be harmless, it's sometimes used in attacks to gather user information, which could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nAdditionally, svchost.exe wrote to a log file and set registry values. SvcHost is a legitimate process but can be abused by malware since many services run under it, making it harder to track malicious activities.\n\nConsidering all these events together—multiple powershell executions with suspicious scripts, temporary script creation and deletion, DLL loading, and svchost activity—it's reasonable to classify this batch as interesting. The confidence is high because the combination suggests possible malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe executions with suspicious command lines, temporary file creation\/deletion, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

First, I notice that there are multiple entries where different processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, and svchost.exe are setting registry values. That's a bit concerning because writing to the registry can be a common tactic for malicious software, but it could also be legitimate system activity.\n\nThen, several events show file creations by svchost.exe in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory with various .dll files. Svchost.exe is known to run many services, so sometimes these activities are normal updates or patches being applied. However, creating multiple DLLs in a download folder might indicate something suspicious, like files being downloaded or extracted as part of an attack.\n\nI also see that svchost.exe and other processes are loading system32 dlls like urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll. These are standard Windows components, so this isn't unusual on its own. But combined with the registry writes and file creations, it might raise some flags about potential tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPowershell.exe is involved in one of the events, creating a profile data file. While PowerShell can be used maliciously, legitimate scripts also use it often for system administration tasks. Without more context on what was executed, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, there are multiple instances where system processes are performing actions that could be part of normal operations or potentially malicious activities. The combination of registry writes and file creations in unusual locations by svchost.exe stands out as particularly concerning because it can be a sign of malicious software attempting to install components or modify system settings without user consent.\n\nI'm not entirely certain if these actions are malicious, but they do warrant closer investigation. It's possible that the system is undergoing legitimate updates, but given the number and variety of operations, especially involving multiple known processes that could be manipulated, it's prudent to look into this further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes (svchost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe) are creating files in the SoftwareDistribution\\\\Download directory and modifying registry values.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system logs to analyze. Each line is a JSON object with some details about what's happening on the system. Let me go through them one by one and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nFirst off, most of these events are from 'svchost.exe'. I remember that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used by various services, so it's not inherently malicious. But sometimes, malware can hide under this name because many services use it as their host. So I need to be cautious.\n\nLooking at the tasks: there are several 'Registry value set' events and some 'File created' events. Registry modifications can be a red flag because attackers often tweak system settings or create persistence mechanisms by modifying registry keys. However, legitimate software also does this during installation or configuration.\n\nThe files mentioned in the logs vary. For example, one file is named 'waasmedic.20250606_143612_048.etl' which looks like an ETL log file—those are usually trace logs from Windows. Another file is a DLL being loaded ('taskschd.dll'), which is normal since task scheduler uses that.\n\nThere's also a file in the 'SoftwareDistribution' directory, which I think is part of Windows Update or Delivery Optimization. Those directories are legitimate and used for storing update-related data, so their creation shouldn't be suspicious on its own.\n\nHowever, the volume of events stands out to me. There are multiple instances where 'svchost.exe' is setting registry values repeatedly—like 10 times in a row doing that. While it's possible for some services to write to the registry frequently, such consistent activity might warrant closer look. Especially if these writes are happening in quick succession or at unusual intervals.\n\nAnother thing is the creation of files with long GUID-like names in the Download and Cache directories. Those could be legitimate temporary files, but sometimes attackers use unique identifiers to avoid detection. Without more context on what these files contain or how they're being used, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events don't specify a process name—like one event where \"process\" is None. That might indicate an activity not tied directly to a known process, which could be concerning if other indicators point towards malicious behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: While individual events might look benign, the combination raises some eyebrows. The repeated registry writes by svchost.exe, coupled with file creations in sensitive directories and the presence of multiple similar events, suggests possible malicious activity trying to stay under the radar by using legitimate processes and standard operations.\n\nI'm not entirely certain without more data, but given the patterns, I'd say this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creations by svchost.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is from svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svchost is a common process that can be legitimate but sometimes used by malware. I'll keep an eye on this, especially since it's modifying the registry.\n\nNext, another svchost.exe event where a file was created in C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install. That path looks familiar—could be part of Windows Update or something else. Then there's a specific file named AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe. The naming seems like a patch, which is normal for updates.\n\nMoving on to MpSigStub.exe events. These are related to Microsoft Defender processes. They're creating several files in the Windows Temp directory with names like mpasdlta.vdm and mpavdlta.vdm. Those look like update deltas for antivirus definitions, so that's expected behavior.\n\nThere's a setup.exe process creating multiple files under C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeCore. These are likely part of the Edge browser installation or updates, which is normal.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value—this is related to Windows Update and UWP app management, so that's standard.\n\nLastly, powershell.exe accessed a process. Powershell can be used for good or bad, but without more context, this event alone isn't suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: svchost.exe modifying the registry could be a red flag, but considering the other events are normal system processes and updates, it's possible that this is just part of Windows Update activities. The file names and paths align with legitimate update procedures. No signs of unusual file creation or access patterns beyond what's typical for system updates and antivirus operations.\n\nTherefore, while there are a few points to note, they don't collectively indicate malicious activity. So the classification would be NOT INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activities such as Windows update processes and antivirus updates. No signs of suspicious behavior detected.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 0,\n  \"RECOMMENDATION\": \"No action required.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, there are a couple of entries where whoami.exe is being run. That seems pretty normal because it's a common tool to check user information. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nThen, powershell.exe shows up multiple times with different tasks. The first time, it's accessing something, then setting a registry value. That could be legitimate admin work, but I know PowerShell is often used by attackers for malicious activities because it has so much power. So that raises an eyebrow.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the powershell.exe events: there's some code using New-Service and Start-Service. Creating a new service sounds like something an attacker would do to install a backdoor or persistence mechanism. The binary path points to C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe, which is a long and suspicious path. That could indicate the creation of a malicious service.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe. They're loading various DLLs, which isn't unusual, but it's worth noting as part of its execution flow.\n\nThen, there's a file being created in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a random-looking name: __PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1. That's a PowerShell script. Creating temporary scripts can be normal, but sometimes attackers use such files to execute malicious code temporarily and then delete them to avoid detection.\n\nAfter the file is created, it gets deleted immediately. This quick creation and deletion might suggest an attempt to hide activity, which is a common tactic in attacks. It could also be part of testing script execution policies, but again, the combination with other actions makes it more concerning.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry value sets from services.exe. That's another red flag because modifying registry entries can be used for persistence or to change system configurations maliciously. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, so seeing it making changes could mean it was exploited or that it's being used as part of an attack chain.\n\nPutting this all together: the repeated use of PowerShell with suspicious command lines, creation and deletion of temporary files, service creation attempts, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity. It doesn't confirm anything definitive, but these patterns are often seen in cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes show suspicious activities including creating services, registry modifications, and temporary file operations indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances where the process is named \"tarefa_logico.exe\" and the winlog task mentions Image loaded with specific files like mscoree.dll and others related to .NET. This seems normal because these are common system files being loaded by legitimate processes. No immediate red flags here.\n\nThen, I notice events involving powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be something to look into, but it's not conclusive yet.\n\nNext, there are entries where the process is None, but the winlog task says \"Execute a Remote Command.\" This is more concerning because if there's no associated process, it might indicate some kind of unauthorized activity or a potential backdoor. \n\nLooking further, several events have powershell.exe command lines executing a script from \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The repeated invocation of this script in the command line is significant. The fact that it's being called multiple times with the same parameters could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or carry out malicious activities like data exfiltration or system compromise.\n\nThe use of try-catch blocks and exiting based on exceptions might be an effort to make the script more resilient, possibly avoiding detection by failing gracefully if something goes wrong. The sleep command at the end suggests it's waiting for some period before continuing, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nPutting this all together, while some events seem benign, the repeated and specific use of PowerShell with scripts from non-standard paths, especially when combined with remote execution tasks without an associated process, raises concerns about potential malicious activity. There's enough here to warrant further investigation to understand what these scripts are doing and whether they're part of a larger attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances executing the same script from an unusual path, combined with remote command execution events without associated processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the process events: several entries show PowerShell executing scripts. The command lines have commands like importing a module and invoking functions. The paths mentioned, such as \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\" and others, seem to be part of a structured directory setup. There's also an attempt to start a service called \"objeto_ativo\". This seems suspicious because creating new services can be a tactic used by malware to maintain persistence.\n\nThen, there are multiple events where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These might indicate that the system is handling service-related tasks. But seeing repeated attempts could be concerning if they're not part of normal operations.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event where PowerShell isn't running a process but involves executing a remote command. The file path points to \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". This script is being executed multiple times in different events. The fact that it's a remote command and the script path is consistent across several entries makes me think this could be part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: there are repeated attempts to create services using PowerShell, which is often used in attacks for persistence. The script being executed remotely might be downloading or running malicious code. The consistency in file paths suggests a coordinated effort, possibly an APT or a sophisticated attack campaign. All these factors point towards this batch being relevant for investigation as potential signs of a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events attempt to create and start services with suspicious paths, and remote command executions suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events provided in JSONL format. Each line is a JSON object containing process, winlog, and file information. My task is to analyze the entire batch as a whole to determine if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, let me parse each event to understand what's happening. Most events have \"winlog\" with tasks like 'Execute a Remote Command', 'Logon', 'Special Logon', or 'Security Group Management'. The file paths in some events point to the same script: \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". That's a PowerShell script, which is common for both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the batch, I notice that 20 out of the 22 events are similar. They all have \"process\" as None, \"winlog\" task as 'Execute a Remote Command', and the same file path. The other two events involve \"services.exe\" with logon tasks and no file access.\n\nThe repetition of the exact same file path in multiple events raises a red flag. Running the same script multiple times could be part of a legitimate process, but it's also a common tactic for attackers to execute malicious scripts repeatedly. Since all these events are identical except for their timestamps (which aren't provided), this uniformity suggests potential automation or scripting, which is often used in attacks.\n\nThe use of PowerShell is another point of concern because it's frequently exploited by attackers due to its powerful execution capabilities and the prevalence of scripts that can be obfuscated. Malware might drop such a script to perform tasks like data exfiltration, installation of backdoors, or other malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the process name is None in these events indicates that there's no parent process being tracked, which could mean the activity is either coming from an initial infection vector or an already-established foothold where processes aren't logged as expected.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch shows a high volume of identical potentially malicious activities. This combination—repeated execution of a suspicious script with no apparent legitimate reason—is indicative of possible malicious behavior that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated events show attempts to execute the same PowerShell script, which could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The user mentioned that they are a cybersecurity expert and wants me to analyze the entire batch as a whole to determine if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, let's break down each event. They all seem to have three keys: \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". Each of these is either null or contains some data. \n\nLooking at the first few events, I see that under \"winlog\", the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path points to \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". This script name seems suspicious because it's a PowerShell script, which is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. \n\nI notice that this exact event repeats multiple times—like maybe 13 or 14 times in the first part of the log. Repeating similar events could indicate something abnormal, such as an attempt to execute the same command over and over, possibly trying to bypass detection mechanisms or due to a malfunction.\n\nThen, there's an event where \"winlog\" task is \"Windows Update Agent\", which is more normal since Windows Update runs periodically. This one doesn't have a file path associated with it, so maybe it's just a legitimate update process check.\n\nBut then again, the events after that switch back to \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the same script path. So overall, the majority of these events are about executing remote commands via this specific PowerShell script.\n\nNow, considering all these together, I need to decide if this batch is interesting or not. Malicious actors often use scripts like .ps1 files for lateral movement, persistence, or other malicious activities because they can be obfuscated and executed remotely. The fact that the same script path is used repeatedly could indicate a possible attack, especially if there are many instances of it.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if this is part of legitimate operations. For instance, maybe system administrators are running scripts for updates or backups, but 14 times in a row seems excessive unless it's automated and something went wrong.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes logs can be flooded with repeated entries as part of a DDoS-like attack on the logging system, but that's less likely here since all events are consistent and not varied.\n\nSo, taking into account the repetition of \"Execute a Remote Command\" with the same script path, which could indicate unauthorized access or malicious activity, I would classify this batch as interesting. The confidence isn't 100% because it's possible for legitimate scripts to be run multiple times, but given that it's remote execution and PowerShell, the risk is higher.\n\nTherefore, my classification is \"INTERESTING\" with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated events indicate potential malicious activity involving remote command execution via a suspicious PowerShell script.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
