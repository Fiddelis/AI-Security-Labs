That seems normal because Chrome is a browser that frequently makes such connections.\n\nNext, there are several entries related to powershell.exe. The initial ProcessCreate event for powershell is notable, especially the command line with ls, get-childitem, and gci commands. These cmdlets list files and directories recursively, which can be part of legitimate scripts but might also indicate reconnaissance or data exfiltration.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple RegistryEvent accesses by powershell.exe. This could be an attempt to modify system configurations, potentially for persistence or malicious activities. \n\nThere's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_2ou0ewlg.ry1.ps1. Then it's immediately deleted. Sudden creation and deletion of files can be red flags, especially if they're script files. This could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies by testing them before executing harmful scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there are ImageLoad events loading various .NET and Windows DLLs, which is standard for PowerShell execution but might be part of obfuscation or loading malicious components.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks from a powershell.exe command line that includes several list commands could indicate an attempt to gather information about the system's file structure. This kind of activity is often seen in early stages of attacks to map the environment before deploying more substantial threats.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events are normal, the combination of multiple registry accesses, script file creation\/deletion, and extensive filesystem enumeration suggests potential malicious behavior. The confidence level isn't very high because there's no clear evidence of harmful actions yet, but these activities could be indicative of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious command lines and file operations, including the creation and deletion of a script file in the Temp directory, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe with command lines that include ls -recurse and get-childitem -recurse. These are common PowerShell commands used for listing files and directories recursively. On their own, these might be innocent, like someone exploring the file system, but repeated use could be a sign of something more malicious.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe creates a file named objeto_principal.txt. Creating new files can be part of data exfiltration or setting up persistence mechanisms. This is something to look into because creating arbitrary files might not always be normal.\n\nLooking further, I notice several events from svchost.exe setting registry values multiple times. SvcHost is a known process that hosts Windows services, but it's often targeted by malware to hide their activities in the system. Multiple registry changes could indicate malicious activity trying to establish persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nThere are also events related to file creations by winlogbeat.exe, which I recognize as part of the Elastic Stack for log management. Since these are legitimate processes, their file creation events might not be suspicious unless they're creating files in unexpected locations or with unusual names.\n\nAdditionally, there are logon and user account management tasks logged, which could indicate changes to user accounts or unauthorized access attempts. However, without more context, it's hard to say if these are malicious or just normal admin activity.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated powershell.exe commands, file creations, and multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe raise red flags. These behaviors can be indicative of a potential attack where an attacker is trying to establish persistence, gather information, or modify system configurations.\n\nI'm confident enough that these events as a whole are suspicious, so I'd classify them as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with file creation and repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are a bunch of events where the task is \"User Account Management\". These might be normal user logins or changes, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe not too concerning on their own.\n\nThen, I see an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a new config file. That makes sense because winlogbeat is a tool for collecting Windows logs, so this is likely just setting up its configuration. Not suspicious.\n\nNext, there are events from RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe accessing the registry. These seem normal too; many applications access the registry for settings or configurations.\n\nThere's an event with powershell.exe where a process was accessed. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that could be interesting. I should note this as a potential red flag.\n\nThen, calc.exe loads urlmon.dll. That's a system file, so it's not unusual. But wait, later on, Calculator.exe also loads the same DLL. Maybe that's just normal operation for these system tools.\n\nFinally, svchost.exe accessing the registry again. Svchost is part of Windows services and often runs legitimate processes, but sometimes malware can hide under its name. Multiple events from it might warrant closer look.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated User Account Management tasks could indicate account changes or many logins. The powershell.exe access stands out because PowerShell is a tool attackers like to use. Also, multiple registry accesses by different processes might be part of legitimate operations but could also hint at malicious activity trying to establish persistence.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because of the PowerShell event and multiple registry changes, which together might indicate some form of attack or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains events that may indicate potential malicious activity, such as a process involving powershell.exe accessing another process and multiple registry modifications. These could be signs of an attack or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
