{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first thing that catches my eye is the repeated use of PowerShell.exe. I know that while PowerShell is a legitimate tool for admins, it's often abused by attackers to execute malicious scripts.\n\nLooking deeper, there are multiple instances where PowerShell accesses processes and registry values. That's not typical user activity; it seems like someone is trying to elevate privileges or modify system settings. Plus, the command line in one of the events shows an attempt to create a new service with a suspicious name \"objeto_ativo\" which translates to \"active object.\" That doesn't ring any bells as a standard service.\n\nAnother red flag is the file creation and deletion of \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1\" in temporary files. This looks like a script test, possibly trying to bypass policy restrictions or execute arbitrary code. The fact that the file was quickly deleted adds to the suspicion—it might be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nThe events also show various image loads and pipe creation, which are common in process injection and lateral movement within networks. Combined with the registry modifications from services.exe, it's possible that something is trying to persist on the system or alter configurations without user consent.\n\nPutting all these together—suspicious PowerShell commands, service creations, file manipulations, and registry changes—it feels like there's a potential malicious activity in progress.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's from services.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because services often interact with the registry. Then there are several entries from tarefa_logico.exe loading different DLLs, like mscoree.dll and others related to .NET framework. Loading these modules is typical for applications running in a .NET environment, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, but creating a profile data file isn't unusual on its own. It might be part of user configuration during startup.\n\nThere are multiple events where services.exe sets registry values again. Since services.exe is a standard Windows process managing services, this activity doesn't raise any red flags unless it's doing something unexpected, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nThen there's an event with no process name creating a file in WindowsUpdate logs. This could just be system logging and maintenance, so that's probably normal.\n\nMsMpEng.exe (Microsoft Monitoring Platform Engine) setting registry values is another benign activity since it's part of legitimate system monitoring tools.\n\nMultiple svchost.exe processes are also setting registry values. Svchost.exe is a common host process for services, and modifying the registry is typical behavior for various Windows services, so this isn't concerning on its own.\n\nPutting all these together, each individual event appears to be normal system activity. There's no indication of unusual or malicious patterns when considering the entire batch. All processes are either standard system components or legitimate applications performing expected actions. Therefore, I would classify this batch as not interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as service process interactions, PowerShell profile creation, and registry modifications by standard processes like services.exe and svchost.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from svchost.exe setting registry values. SvcHost is a common system process, so seeing it in logs isn't unusual. However, repeated registry modifications could be suspicious because attackers often tweak system settings to maintain persistence or elevate privileges. So, I'm a bit concerned about multiple RegistryEvent tasks here.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating several files under the Microsoft Edge directory. Setup.exe is typically used for installing software, so these file creation events seem normal during an installation process. The specific paths mentioned are standard locations for program files, which makes me think this could be legitimate software updates or installations.\n\nAdditionally, RuntimeBroker.exe modifying registry values isn't surprising since it's a Windows process involved in managing runtime environments and COM activation. It interacting with the registry is part of its normal operation.\n\nThere's also an event where setup.exe loads taskschd.dll, which is related to Task Scheduler. This is typical for setup processes that might need to schedule tasks post-installation.\n\nThe last few events continue with setup.exe creating files in the Edge Application directory, which again seems like standard behavior for installing or updating software.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple registry writes by svchost.exe could be a red flag, but without additional context indicating malicious activity, it's hard to say definitively. However, the presence of legitimate-looking setup.exe activities suggests that perhaps this is part of an update or installation process that includes both file creation and some system configuration changes.\n\nSince there are no obvious signs of overtly malicious behavior like access to sensitive files, network connections, or known bad processes, I'm leaning towards these events being more about normal software updates. However, the repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe are still a bit concerning without further info.\n\nTaking into account that while some elements could be suspicious, the overall pattern doesn't clearly indicate malicious activity. Therefore, my classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and file creations by setup.exe could indicate potential malicious activity or system configuration changes that merit further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nLooking through each event, most of them are from processes like svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe. The tasks they're performing are mainly related to the registry—setting values or adding\/deleting objects. There are a few events where files are created by setup.exe in different locations, including creating some .exe files and shortcut links.\n\nFirst off, svchost.exe is known as a legitimate Windows process that hosts various services. But sometimes it's used by malware because of its common name. The fact that it's performing multiple registry operations could be suspicious. However, Windows services do modify the registry regularly, so I can't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThen there are events from services.exe and setup.exe. Services.exe is another legitimate process for managing system services. Setup.exe sounds like it's part of an installation routine, maybe Microsoft Edge given the file paths mentioned.\n\nThe log entries show a lot of Registry value sets and object modifications, which on their own aren't necessarily bad. But the frequency might be something to look at—there are several events from different processes doing similar tasks. Maybe this is part of a legitimate update or installation process, but it's hard to say without more context.\n\nLooking at the file creation events by setup.exe: creating new .exe files and shortcut links in standard directories like Program Files, Windows System32, and Start Menu. These could be normal parts of an application installation. For example, Microsoft Edge might create these files during a setup or update process.\n\nHowever, I'm noticing that some of the file paths are not the most common places for applications to write. For instance, creating files in ProgramData and System32 could be part of legitimate operations, but they're also areas where malicious actors sometimes place their own files. The fact that multiple files are being created by setup.exe might indicate something more than just a standard installation.\n\nAlso, considering the timestamps—if these events happened over a short period, it might suggest a concerted effort to modify system configurations, which could be part of an attack. But without knowing when each event occurred, it's hard to assess the timing.\n\nAnother point is that all these processes are performing multiple operations, especially svchost.exe having several registry modifications. That could mean a service or application is trying to configure itself extensively, which might not be normal unless it's part of an update.\n\nI'm also thinking about indicators of compromise (IoCs). Are any of the file paths or registry keys known malicious? The specific .exe files created by setup.exe—msedge_proxy.exe and pwahelper.exe—are those legitimate? If they're part of Microsoft Edge, that's fine. But if not, it could be suspicious.\n\nThe creation of shortcut links in standard locations is usually okay, but sometimes attackers create shortcuts to run malicious processes at startup or during logon. The presence of multiple such files might warrant closer investigation.\n\nIn terms of confidence level: while there are some red flags like unusual file creations and multiple registry modifications by known legitimate yet sometimes abused processes, I'm not entirely sure if this indicates malicious activity. It could just be a system update or software installation going on. However, the volume of events and the specific operations might lean towards being more suspicious.\n\nI think it's INTERESTING enough to look into further because while each event individually might not raise red flags, together they suggest some level of system configuration changes that could indicate malicious behavior or at least something out of the ordinary.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creations by processes like svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe may indicate suspicious activity.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from \"setup.exe\" performing registry operations—either setting a value or adding\/removing an object. Setup.exe is commonly used for software installations, so these might be normal activities during setup. However, repeated registry changes could indicate malicious behavior like persistence mechanisms. I'll note that but wait to make a conclusion.\n\nNext, there are Pipe Created events from \"setup.exe.\" Named pipes can be used by malware for inter-process communication, which is concerning. While some legitimate processes use pipes, the volume here might raise flags.\n\nThen, several entries show \"svchost.exe\" creating temporary files in the Windows Temp directory with varying filenames. These names look like random strings, which isn't typical for standard system operations. Temporary files created by svchost could be part of legitimate activities but random naming might suggest something more suspicious, possibly malicious file creation or persistence.\n\nI also notice that one of the svchost.exe entries creates a file in \"C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness\\\" with a path that includes \"S-1-5-18,\" which is the well-known NT AUTHORITY\\System SID. This could imply high privilege operations, adding more weight to potential malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: setup.exe making multiple registry changes and pipe creations, plus svchost.exe creating numerous temporary files with random names and one in a system directory under a high-privilege context—these patterns are often indicative of malware installation or activity. The combination suggests possible malicious behavior rather than normal operations.

Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, most of the logs are about svchost.exe creating files or modifying registry entries. Svchost is known as a legitimate Windows process, often used by services. However, it can be abused by malware because many processes run under this name. So seeing multiple file creation events from svchost might raise flags if they're not part of normal operations.\n\nLooking closer, the files being created are in AppReadiness folders with long paths that look like SIDs (Security Identifiers). These could be related to service installations or updates, but repeated identical file creations might indicate something suspicious, like a script or malware trying to create multiple files quickly.\n\nThen there are several registry value sets by svchost.exe. Modifying the registry is common for configuration changes, but again, if done by a process that's often used by malicious actors, it could be concerning. The number of these events—six in total—is notable and might suggest some automated or bulk operation.\n\nNext, there's an entry from RuntimeBroker.exe modifying the registry. Runtime Broker is another legitimate Windows component, so this alone isn't suspicious, but combined with the other svchost activity, it adds to the overall picture.\n\nThe interesting part comes towards the end with powershell.exe being executed. The command line shows a restricted execution policy and a simple Write-Host command. While using PowerShell in scripts is common, especially under Restricted Execution Policy, which is meant to limit script execution, it's worth noting that this could be a way to execute malicious commands if not properly controlled.\n\nThe subsequent entries show powershell.exe loading various DLLs, which is normal as PowerShell uses these for its functionality. However, the combination of svchost activity and a restricted PowerShell command might hint at some kind of lateral movement or persistence mechanism where scripts are being executed but kept under control to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together, while each individual event might not be alarming on their own, the pattern—multiple file creations by svchost.exe, registry modifications, and a controlled PowerShell execution—could indicate malicious activity. The repetition of certain actions (like creating multiple files in the same path) is a red flag for automation, which is often used by attackers to establish persistence or spread across systems.\n\nTherefore, this batch seems relevant enough for further investigation because it could signal an ongoing attack where an attacker is setting up backdoors or deploying malicious scripts in a controlled manner.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation and registry modification events by svchost.exe, along with PowerShell execution under restricted policy, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

Let's look through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the events involve powershell.exe. PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, so that's something to keep in mind. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is loading images (Image loaded) which might indicate script execution or module loading. Also, there are file creation events, like creating temp files with .psm1 extensions, which are PowerShell module files. Creating temporary modules could be a sign of malicious activity trying to bypass restrictions.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the powershell.exe processes, it's executing with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. That might seem normal because sometimes scripts need execution policies relaxed, but in this case, using -Command with Get-Item and checking for specific .inf files could be part of a script that's trying to enumerate or modify system configurations.\n\nThere are also multiple instances where MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender are being loaded. These are legitimate files related to Microsoft Defender, but sometimes attackers might try to load these as part of their process to avoid detection or blend in with normal traffic.\n\nAdditionally, there's a whoami.exe execution, which is often used to gather system information. While it's not inherently malicious, its presence alongside powershell.exe activity could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nConsidering all the events together: multiple powershell.exe processes loading various modules, creating temp files, accessing other processes, and executing commands that check for .inf files might indicate scripting activity trying to achieve persistence or execute malicious code. The repeated use of powershell with different arguments and file operations adds up to potentially suspicious behavior.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch shows a series of actions that could be part of a script attempting to perform unauthorized activities on the system, making it interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity, including file creation and loading of modules, indicate potential malicious scripting.

Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe loading a DLL related to Windows Defender. That's a bit unusual because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, but sometimes it's legitimate too. So I'll note that but keep an eye on the other events to see if there's more context.\n\nNext up, cmd.exe is running a command line with Dism and some parameters. The command seems to be disabling Windows Defender features and removing them without restarting. That sounds suspicious because why would someone disable defender? Maybe trying to stop it from detecting something.\n\nThe third event again is powershell.exe accessing something. I'm thinking this could be part of the same activity as before, maybe setting up some persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThen there are multiple events from Dism.exe creating and accessing files in a temporary directory. Each file path ends with .dll or similar, which suggests that Dism is extracting components into temp folders. The repeated 'File Executable Detected' tasks make me think these are being flagged as potential threats, but it's part of the normal process for Dism.\n\nBut wait, why would Dism.exe be executing so many files and creating new ones? It seems excessive, especially if the user didn't initiate a legitimate update or repair. Also, combining this with the earlier command to disable Windows Defender makes me think someone is trying to remove defender components, possibly to avoid detection of malicious activities.\n\nLooking at all these together: using cmd.exe to run Dism commands that disable and remove Windows Defender features, then having powershell and Dism accessing and creating multiple files. It feels like an attack vector where the bad actor is attempting to compromise the system by disabling security features and using legitimate tools in a malicious way.\n\nI'm also considering if this could be a false positive or normal activity. If the user was intentionally performing maintenance, maybe not, but the combination of disabling defender and multiple file accesses seems too coordinated for that. Plus, the temp files created by Dism.exe under a specific path seem tailored, which might indicate some form of payload extraction.\n\nSo overall, the batch shows signs of potentially malicious behavior aimed at compromising system security features.

I see that all these events have the same 'process' field with the name 'Dism.exe'.

This suggests that the system detected executable files being created or accessed. \n\nLooking at the 'file' paths, they all point to temporary directories within the user's AppData folder.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of the events are from \"DismHost.exe\" loading various DLL files into memory. The paths all point to a temporary folder under the user's AppData directory. DismHost.exe sounds familiar—it’s related to Windows Deployment Services, so it's probably part of the system's legitimate processes during setup or configuration.\n\nLooking at the events, each one has a task labeled as \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\". This suggests that these are just notifications about DLLs being loaded into memory. Since DismHost.exe is known for handling deployment tasks, this activity could be normal when setting up or customizing a system image. So far, nothing seems suspicious.\n\nThen there's an event where the process terminates with \"Process terminated (rule: ProcessTerminate)\". This is expected behavior when the deployment task completes—it’s just cleaning up after itself.\n\nBut then I see events from \"Dism.exe\" logging file deletions of specific DLLs like AppxProvider.dll,AssocProvider.dll, and CbsProvider.dll. These are files that were previously loaded by DismHost.exe. The deletion is logged under \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\". Now, I'm thinking—why delete these files after loading them?\n\nI know that during system deployment or updates, it's common to create temporary files and then delete them once they're no longer needed. So, the pattern here could be part of a normal setup process where DismHost.exe loads necessary components into memory for configuration, and then Dism.exe deletes those temp files after the job is done.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether this activity is within expected bounds. If these events are happening during an actual deployment operation initiated by the user or as part of scheduled maintenance, it's normal. But if they occur without any preceding legitimate system activity, especially in a context where no deployment is expected, that could be suspicious.\n\nAnother angle to think about is whether the file paths and names align with what DismHost.exe typically interacts with. The temporary folder name (33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89) looks like a GUID, which is standard for temporary folders in Windows processes. So the files being deleted are specific to this particular deployment operation.\n\nI also note that all these events happen sequentially—first loading multiple DLLs, then terminating the process, and finally deleting each file one by one. This sequence makes sense during a deployment or cleanup phase.\n\nIn terms of indicators of compromise (IoCs), I don't see any red flags like unusual file names, paths outside the expected temporary directories, or evidence of persistence mechanisms. The events are self-contained within a single temp folder and involve known system files related to deployment.\n\nTherefore, considering all these points, it's likely that this batch of logs represents normal Windows deployment activity rather than malicious behavior. Unless there's additional context suggesting otherwise, such as unexpected timing or unusual volumes of similar events, I wouldn't classify this as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nThe batch of system log events is **not suspicious** and can be attributed to normal Windows deployment activities. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Process Activity**: The events involve \"DismHost.exe\" loading DLLs into memory, which is expected during system setup or configuration tasks.\n\n2. **File Operations**: The subsequent deletion of these DLLs by \"Dism.exe\" aligns with typical cleanup procedures after a deployment operation concludes.\n\n3. **Expected Sequence**: The sequential nature—loading, process termination, and file deletion—is consistent with legitimate system operations.\n\n4. **No Red Flags**: No unusual file names or paths are present; all actions occur within standard temporary directories.\n\n**Conclusion:** These events represent normal Windows deployment behavior and do not indicate suspicious activity."}

This indicates that a file deletion was detected by some monitoring rule. However, since this is happening multiple times and all are being logged as deletions, it's important to consider whether such activity is typical for Dism.exe.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to files in the same temporary directory: \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\\\en-US\\\\\". The specific files being deleted are various .dll.mui files, which are resource files used for localization in Windows. Temporary directories often house files that are created and then cleaned up as part of normal operations, especially during installations or updates.\n\nNow, considering the context, Dism.exe is known to delete unnecessary files from a mounted image during cleanup processes. These .mui files are likely temporary and not required once the deployment process is complete. So, it's reasonable to assume that deleting these files is part of Dism.exe's standard operation.\n\nGiven that all events involve legitimate system tools performing expected file deletions in a known temporary directory, there doesn't seem to be any malicious behavior here. The repetition of similar events might raise an eyebrow if the number was unusually high or outside normal operations, but in this case, it appears to fit within the expected scope of Dism.exe's functionality.\n\nI should also consider whether these deletions are happening during a legitimate process, such as after deploying an image or performing updates. Since all events share the same file path structure and similar filenames, it points towards a single operation where multiple temporary files are being cleaned up.\n\nAnother angle is to check if there are any unusual patterns, like deletions occurring outside typical hours or in unexpected volumes. However, without additional context about the frequency of such operations, I have to rely on what's provided.\n\nIn conclusion, these events don't exhibit signs of malicious activity. They seem to be part of Dism.exe's normal operation, specifically cleaning up temporary files after an imaging process.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events involves legitimate system processes performing routine file deletions in a known temporary directory. These activities are consistent with the expected behavior of the Deployment Imaging Service and Management tool (Dism.exe) during cleanup operations following an imaging process. The deletion of localization resource files (.dll.mui) is typical and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The events are normal and not indicative of cybersecurity threats.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": false,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The events involve legitimate system processes (Dism.exe) performing routine file deletions in a known temporary directory. These activities are consistent with expected behavior during cleanup operations following an imaging process.\"\n}\n```"}

Each event is a JSON object, and there are 14 such entries.\n\nFirst, the process name in each event is \"Dism.exe\". I know that Dism.exe stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool, which is used for servicing Windows images. It's a legitimate system tool, often used during OS installations or updates. So, it's not inherently malicious.\n\nEach event has the same task in winlog: \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\". This indicates that a file was deleted and this action was detected by some monitoring rule. The files being deleted are all DLLs located in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder. The specific paths point to various providers like FfuProvider.dll, FolderProvider.dll, etc.\n\nLooking at these files, they seem to be part of a Windows servicing stack. These DLLs are typically associated with components that handle different aspects of system setup and configuration. For example, \"MsiProvider.dll\" relates to MSI (Microsoft Installer) handling, and others might relate to image servicing or other OS-related tasks.\n\nSince Dism.exe is a legitimate process and the files being deleted are standard components used during Windows servicing operations, this activity doesn't raise any red flags. It's something that would happen as part of normal system maintenance, updates, or installations.\n\nMoreover, all events show consistent file paths and similar filenames, which suggests a systematic cleanup rather than random deletions that could indicate malicious behavior. If these files were deleted during an update process, it's expected they might be cleaned up afterward.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual activity here, like multiple processes involved, access to restricted areas, or attempts to delete sensitive system files. The uniformity and the nature of the files being deleted align with legitimate operations.\n\nTherefore, considering all these points, this batch doesn't seem suspicious. It's likely just part of a normal Windows servicing process.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events are not considered suspicious. They represent legitimate file deletion activities carried out by the Dism.exe process during system servicing or updates. \n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"incident\": {\n    \"determination\": \"not-suspicious\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The events involve legitimate system processes (Dism.exe) performing routine file deletions related to Windows servicing components, indicating normal system maintenance rather than malicious activity.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this JSON data and trying to figure out what's going on. There are a bunch of logs here, each with three fields: process, winlog, and file. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial entries mention processes like \"services.exe\" and \"svchost.exe,\" which I know are system services. They have registry-related tasks, so maybe something is being configured in the Windows Registry. Then there's an entry where a file path points to taskschd.dll, which is part of Task Scheduler, so perhaps some scheduled tasks are being set up.\n\nThe next entries catch my attention because they involve PowerShell commands. The command lines show that a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" is being created and started using New-Service and Start-Service cmdlets. This means an external program is being installed as a Windows service, which could be either legitimate or malicious depending on what it does.\n\nI also notice multiple repeated entries with the same PowerShell command. Repeating the same command might indicate an attempt to ensure the service is created every time, maybe trying to bypass some security measures or ensuring persistence.\n\nThe final entries have a different PowerShell command that writes \"Final result: 1\" to the host. This could be a confirmation script, but it's unusual to see this kind of output in these logs unless something went wrong or someone is testing if the system responds as expected.\n\nPutting it all together, I'm thinking that an attacker might have used these PowerShell commands to create a persistent service (objeto_ativo) and then ran some checks. The repeated attempts suggest they might be trying to ensure their changes stick or test if the service was successfully created each time. The final command writing \"Final result: 1\" could either be a success message or part of an exploit looking for specific responses.\n\nI should also consider the file paths mentioned, like \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe.\" These look crafted and don't follow standard Windows naming conventions, which makes me suspicious. They might be attempting to hide their files or use less common paths to avoid detection.\n\nIn summary, the logs show system processes being modified through registry changes and new services being added using PowerShell. The repetitive nature of these commands and the unusual file paths make it seem like there's potentially malicious activity aimed at creating a persistent backdoor or implant on the system.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided JSON data represents log entries that appear to be related to cybersecurity events, possibly indicating suspicious activities such as attempts to create new services using PowerShell commands. Here is an organized breakdown of the key observations and potential implications:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Process Creation Attempts:**\n   - Multiple entries indicate attempts to create a service named `objeto_ativo` using PowerShell commands. This service points to the file path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n   - The repetitive nature of these attempts suggests an effort to ensure persistence or test if the service creation was successful.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Entries involving processes like `services.exe` and `svchost.exe` indicate registry-related tasks, possibly indicating configuration changes that could be part of malicious activities.\n\n3. **File Path Analysis:**\n   - The file path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` appears unusual and non-standard, which raises suspicions. Such paths may be used to hide malicious files or components.\n\n4. **Final Command Execution:**\n   - PowerShell commands ending with `Write-Host 'Final result: 1'` might indicate a confirmation script or part of an exploit seeking specific responses.\n\n### Potential Implications:\n- The repetitive and unusual activities suggest potential unauthorized access or attempts to establish persistence on the system.\n- The creation of a new service using non-standard file paths may be indicative of malware attempting to create a backdoor or persistent mechanism.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs show signs of potentially malicious activity, including the creation of new services via PowerShell commands, registry modifications, and the use of unusual file paths. These activities could be part of an attack aiming to establish persistence on the system."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events in JSONL format and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening. There are 13 events total. Looking at the first few, they all involve powershell.exe being executed with specific commands. \n\nThe first four events have a command line that runs Write-Host with 'Final result: 1'. This seems straightforward—PowerShell is just echoing a message to the console. The task in Windows logs is either 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle', which are standard events related to how PowerShell initializes.\n\nThen, from event 5 onwards, the command line changes. It's still using powershell.exe with ExecutionPolicy Restricted, but now it's executing a more complex script. This script sets $Res to 0 and then looks for files in the Windows INF directory. For each .inf file, it reads the content and checks if there's a specific pattern related to installation sections. If found, $Res is set to 1 and breaks out of the loop, then writes the result.\n\nThis seems more concerning because it's accessing system files and looking for certain configurations that might indicate driver installations or similar activities. However, since the script is using Get-Item on a known Windows directory and checking for standard patterns, it might not be malicious on its own.\n\nI also notice that all these events are from the same process but with different task types. The consistency in command lines suggests either automated checks or legitimate scripts run by an administrator.\n\nConsidering the frequency of these events—there are multiple instances of each command line and task type—it could indicate repeated attempts to check system configurations, which might be part of a script running periodically. But without additional context like timestamps or other logs indicating unusual behavior, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThe fact that the ExecutionPolicy is set to Restricted adds some security, but scripts can still perform legitimate tasks within those restrictions. Since these don't seem to involve any known malicious indicators (like downloading files, executing binaries, etc.), I'm leaning towards them being non-malicious.\n\nTherefore, while there's activity worth monitoring due to the use of PowerShell and system file access, without evidence of further suspicious actions, this batch doesn't raise enough red flags. My confidence is around 0.6 because some elements are borderline but not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate PowerShell commands that check system files for known patterns, with no evidence of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. So, I'm presented with a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and my task is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes. I need to analyze all these events together and make a single classification.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event has a process command line that runs powershell.exe with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The command inside seems to be checking for .inf files in the Windows directory under the 'inf' folder. It looks like it's searching for specific patterns related to installation entries, maybe trying to detect something malicious or unauthorized. Powershell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag.\n\nThe second event has no process information but shows that there was activity in the Security Group Management task. That sounds routine unless combined with other events it might indicate some group policy changes or access attempts, which could be suspicious.\n\nThe third event is the services.exe process, which is part of Windows' system processes. It's associated with logon events. Services.exe typically handles service-related tasks, so this seems normal on its own but could tie into other activities if there's something else to suggest it's part of a larger sequence.\n\nThe fourth event again has no process info and shows Special Logon activity. Special logons are often used by system services or background processes, which in themselves aren't unusual unless they're happening at odd times or in conjunction with other events.\n\nNow, looking at the entire batch together: The first event stands out because it's executing powershell.exe with a script that searches for .inf files and specific patterns. This could be an attempt to detect or enumerate installed drivers or system components. If this is part of a larger attack chain, such as reconnaissance before deployment, it might indicate malicious intent.\n\nThe combination of the first event's activity with the others might suggest an attacker attempting to establish persistence or move laterally within the network. The use of powershell with restricted execution policy isn't inherently suspicious, but the specific command being executed could be a telltale sign if it aligns with known attack patterns.\n\nHowever, considering that each individual event doesn't necessarily look malicious on its own, and without additional context like timestamps or more events showing unusual behavior, it's hard to definitively classify this batch as definitely malicious. But there's enough in the first event to raise an eyebrow, especially if we're looking for potential indicators of compromise related to script-based attacks or driver injection.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because while not conclusive on their own, together they suggest possible malicious activity that warrants further investigation. The confidence level is moderate because the first event shows potentially suspicious behavior, but without more data, it's not a certainty.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes an unusual PowerShell command checking for specific patterns in .inf files, which could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}
