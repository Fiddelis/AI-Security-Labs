Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice several events where powershell.exe is being executed with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. The commands are setting up tasks using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask. These scheduled tasks are set to execute calc.exe at logon, which is unusual because calc.exe isn't typically used maliciously on its own. However, the way it's being executed via PowerShell could indicate some level of automation or persistence.\n\nLooking further, all these events have a task type of 'Provider Lifecycle', which might be related to system services starting up. But the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with similar names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc., seems suspicious. It's possible that an attacker is trying to create multiple tasks as a way to hide malicious activity or ensure persistence.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. These actions can be part of legitimate administration, but when combined with the creation of scheduled tasks, they raise flags. The registry modifications could be for maintaining persistence or altering system configurations.\n\nAdditionally, there are some events related to chrome.exe creating pipes and accessing the registry. While these might not be malicious on their own, the combination with the powershell activities could suggest a broader campaign where multiple processes are being manipulated.\n\nOne event shows mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll being loaded by powershell.exe. These DLLs are part of the .NET framework, which is standard, but their loading in conjunction with PowerShell commands might be part of script execution or more malicious activity like dropping further payloads.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it's concerning because:\n1. Multiple scheduled tasks are created with similar patterns, which could indicate an attempt to create a persistent backdoor.\n2. The use of powershell.exe for task creation is common in attacks due to its scripting capabilities and legitimate appearance.\n3. Registry modifications and process access can be signs of malicious behavior aimed at maintaining persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThe confidence level is high because the combination of these activities strongly suggests potential malicious intent, especially given the persistence mechanisms and use of administrative privileges.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe at logon, combined with registry modifications and process access, indicate possible malicious activity aiming for persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where PowerShell is loading different DLL files. The paths look legitimate, like parts of the .NET framework and Windows Defender components. These aren't immediately suspicious on their own because PowerShell often loads these modules when running scripts or commands. But I should keep an eye on how many such events there are.\n\nThen, I notice two events where a file is created and then deleted by PowerShell in the same location: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\. The creation of temporary files isn't unusual, but the fact that it's deleted shortly after might be a red flag. Malware sometimes creates files to write data or as part of persistence mechanisms and deletes them afterward to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where PowerShell runs a command-line script that sets up a scheduled task using `New-ScheduledTaskAction` and `Register-ScheduledTask`. The action is set to execute calc.exe on logon. While legitimate scripts can create tasks, this specific one stands out because it uses administrative privileges (`BUILTIN\\Administrators`) with the highest run level. This could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or elevate privileges, which are common in malicious activities.\n\nThen there are multiple entries from chrome.exe modifying registry values. Chrome often interacts with the registry for updates and extensions, so these might not be suspicious on their own. However, several events in a row could be worth looking into if they deviate from normal behavior, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe last set of events show \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks with no process or file info. This is concerning because executing remote commands can be a sign of remote administration or command-line attacks. Without knowing the source or reason for these commands, they could indicate unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell activities (DLL loading, temp file creation\/deletion, scheduled task setup), combined with remote command execution and repeated registry changes from Chrome, create a concerning pattern. The scheduled task setup to run calc.exe on logon as an admin is particularly suspicious. These signs could indicate potential malicious behavior or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activities including temp file creation\/deletion, DLL loading, and setting up a scheduled task with calc.exe as an action, potentially indicating malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user is asking me to act as a cybersecurity expert and analyze a batch of system log events in JSONL format. They want me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not, providing a single result with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what makes an event batch interesting. Typically, it's about anomalies, repeated suspicious activities, or indicators of malicious behavior across multiple events. So, looking through each event:\n\n1. Most events are \"Execute a Remote Command\" without much detail, which might be normal if the system runs such tasks frequently.\n2. There's a PowerShell script that creates a scheduled task using 'New-ScheduledTaskAction' and registers it under a unique name 'unidade_comum'. This is concerning because creating persistent tasks can be a tactic for persistence in attacks.\n3. The creation of a file named 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum' by svchost.exe could indicate an attempt to create a malicious task or modify system files, which is a red flag.\n4. Another event shows the use of powershell.exe creating a profile data file, but more importantly, it's associated with setting registry values and creating files, which can be part of establishing persistence or lateral movement.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple instances of remote command execution, manipulation of scheduled tasks, and changes to system files and registries. These are all hallmarks of potential malicious activity, especially when they're done by processes like svchost.exe and powershell.exe, which are commonly used in attacks. The repeated nature of these events suggests a possible attack campaign or post-attack activities.\n\nI should classify this as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination points to possible compromise indicators. My confidence is high, maybe around 0.9, since it's based on several concerning signs.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious activities including remote command execution, registry modifications, and file creations that could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to analyze them all together to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first seven events are all from the same process: chrome.exe, with the task being 'Registry value set' under the rule RegistryEvent. So, Chrome is making changes to the Windows registry. That's a bit unusual because I know that legitimate software sometimes writes to the registry during operation or updates, but multiple instances in quick succession might be suspicious.\n\nThen there's an event where chrome.exe made a DNS query. That seems normal if it's part of navigation or loading resources. But again, considering it's after several registry changes, maybe it's worth looking into.\n\nNext up is winlogbeat.exe creating a file at a specific path. Winlogbeat is likely the service itself writing logs, so this event might not be out of place unless there's something odd about the file path or naming.\n\nFinally, powershell.exe is involved in creating another file called objeto_auxiliar.txt. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for command-line scripting and can execute code. The filename seems generic, but combined with the process name, it raises some flags because malicious actors commonly use PowerShell to drop files as part of their activities.\n\nLooking at all these events together: multiple registry writes from Chrome, a DNS query, and file creation via both winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. While individually they might not be alarming, the combination could indicate something more concerning. The repeated registry changes by Chrome are a red flag because legitimate processes usually don't modify the registry that frequently unless there's an update or specific user actions.\n\nAlso, considering the use of PowerShell for file creation is often linked to malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities and common use in attacks. The fact that these events come from different processes but are all within the same log window might suggest a coordinated activity, possibly an attack chain where multiple tools are used.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch shows behaviors that could be part of a cyberattack. There's potential for data exfiltration or installation of malicious software using these tools and actions. Therefore, this batch should be classified as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe, DNS query, and file creations via winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
