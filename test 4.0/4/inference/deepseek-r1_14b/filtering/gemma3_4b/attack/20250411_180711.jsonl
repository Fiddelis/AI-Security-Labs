{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where 'chrome.exe' is making DNS queries and establishing network connections. That seems normal because Chrome does need to access websites, so I don't think that's suspicious on its own. But maybe the number of connections or repeated queries could be a sign, but nothing here stands out as obviously malicious.\n\nNext, there are events involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities and can execute commands. Let me look closer at these entries:\n\n1. The first PowerShell event shows a process access rule. That might just mean another program interacted with PowerShell, but not necessarily bad.\n2. Then there's a process create event for 'whoami.exe', which is a legitimate system tool used to display user information. It being executed by PowerShell could be part of a script trying to gather info, which might indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement.\n3. The next few events are again process accesses and registry modifications. Registry changes can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malware to survive reboots. That's concerning because it shows possible tampering with system settings.\n4. One PowerShell event has a complex command line. Let me parse that. It looks like the script is encoding some plaintext using XOR encryption with a key and then sending it via POST to example.com. Obfuscating data before sending it over the network is a common tactic in malware to hide information. This makes me think the script is trying to send sensitive data, possibly stolen credentials or other malicious payloads.\n5. There are multiple image load events from PowerShell, which is normal when scripts execute and load necessary libraries. But if these libraries are from unusual locations or have been modified, it could be a red flag. In this case, they seem like standard .NET framework files, so maybe not suspicious on their own.\n6. File creation and deletion of '__PSScriptPolicyTest_j0wb0i2i.xpe.ps1' in the Temp directory caught my eye. Creating temporary script files is common for testing policies or scripts, but the naming suggests it's related to PowerShell execution policy tests. Malware might test if certain policies are enforced before executing more malicious code.\n7. Deleting the same file shortly after creation could be part of a cleanup routine to avoid detection. But again, this isn't conclusive without knowing the broader context.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple instances of PowerShell activity, including script execution, registry modifications, data encoding and transmission, and temporary file handling. These behaviors are often seen in attack chains—like lateral movement, data exfiltration, or establishing persistence. The combination makes me think this could be part of an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) or a sophisticated cyberattack where attackers are using legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nI'm not 100% certain, but the pattern seems concerning enough to warrant investigation. So I'd classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" with high confidence because it combines several red flags related to potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell execution, including script parsing, registry modifications, and network activities indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events. The first event is a PowerShell process starting with the name powershell.exe and mentions a pipe being created. That's normal because PowerShell often uses pipes for inter-process communication.\n\nThen, the next several events all have similar command lines. They're executing a script that encrypts some plaintext by XORing it with a simple key. The plaintext includes paths like \"C:\\Users\\victim\". This encryption isn't very sophisticated since it's using a predictable key and method, which is a red flag because attackers often use more robust encryption.\n\nThe script then sends the ciphertext to example.com via an HTTP POST request. Repeated attempts to send data to the same external domain might indicate data exfiltration, especially if it's part of a malicious payload.\n\nLooking at the events together, I notice there are multiple identical command lines. This repetition suggests that the same script is being executed multiple times, possibly as part of a loop or automated process. Such behavior could be indicative of an attacker trying to send data in chunks or retrying after failures, which is common in exfiltration activities.\n\nThe use of Invoke-WebRequest without a valid SSL certificate (as 'example.com' isn't a real site) and the lack of legitimate business justification for such network activity adds to the suspicion. Legitimate scripts usually don't use hard-coded domains like this or send sensitive data over unencrypted channels.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell usage, XOR encryption with a simple key, repeated POST requests to an external domain, and the inclusion of user-specific paths makes this batch of events highly suspicious. It's likely related to malicious activity such as data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing XOR-based encryption and sending data to an external domain, indicating potential data exfiltration or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis to determine if the batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple events involving `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has built-in encryption and can execute scripts. The command lines show Base64 decoding and XOR operations, which are common techniques in obfuscation to hide malicious code. This suggests an attempt to encode data, possibly stolen information or commands.\n\nLooking deeper into the `powershell.exe` events: there's a process access event, which means another process is interacting with it—maybe trying to inject code or elevate privileges. There are also registry value sets, which could indicate persistence mechanisms, allowing the malware to survive reboots.\n\nAnother red flag is the communication attempt via an HTTP POST request in the command line. This is typical for sending data exfiltration or receiving commands from a C2 server. The URL is hardcoded as \"example.com,\" but in real scenarios, it would be a domain associated with malicious activities.\n\nI also see multiple entries where `powershell.exe` loads different DLLs like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. These might not be suspicious on their own, but combined with the other actions, they could be part of lateral movement or trying to hide malicious activity.\n\nThere's an event from `winlogbeat.exe`, which is likely a legitimate tool for log management. However, it's creating files in specific paths, and I should check if these are expected behaviors based on how winlogbeat is configured. Unusual file creations could indicate tampering with logs or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe DNS query event doesn't provide much context without knowing the queried domain, but combined with other network activities, it might be part of C2 communication attempts.\n\nIn summary, while some events like notepad.exe and calc.exe accessing urlmon.dll are normal, the extensive use of powershell.exe with obfuscation techniques, registry modifications, process interactions, and HTTP communication points to potential malicious activity. The consistent pattern across multiple events increases my confidence that this batch is indeed suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes show XOR operations on plaintext data and attempt to communicate with a remote server, indicating possible exfiltration or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where different processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe are setting registry values. Registry modifications can be normal for legitimate software but can also be a sign of malicious activity because attackers often need persistence or modify settings to hide their tracks. \n\nThen there's chrome.exe making several RegistryEvent tasks. Chrome is a common application, so some registry writes might be standard updates or configuration changes. However, multiple instances might raise an eyebrow if they seem excessive.\n\nLooking at the winlog events, I notice that powershell.exe has both RegistryEvent and ProcessAccess tasks. Powershell is often used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute commands. The presence of ProcessAccess indicates that another process is accessing powershell.exe, which could be a sign of lateral movement or malicious behavior.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe was executed with a command line pointing to its system32 location. Whoami is typically used to get user information, but in some contexts, it can be part of reconnaissance or credential dumping techniques. \n\nAnother event stands out: powershell.exe being called with a command that deletes a specific file. The command uses Remove-Item against a .bat script path. This could indicate an attempt to remove traces of previous activity or delete malicious scripts used during an attack.\n\nAdditionally, the winlogbeat.exe process creating a new configuration file isn't suspicious on its own since it's likely part of log collection tools setting up their data files.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows multiple signs that might be concerning. The repeated registry modifications by different processes could be attempts to establish persistence or alter system configurations. The powershell.exe activities, especially the deletion command, are red flags because they can be used in attacks for hiding evidence or executing malicious scripts. The use of whoami.exe adds to the suspicion as it's often part of initial access or lateral movement phases.\n\nWhile some events might seem benign on their own, the combination and frequency of these actions—especially involving powershell.exe and registry changes—suggest potential malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes, including powershell.exe, show suspicious activities such as registry modifications, file deletions, and process access.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries where each line represents an event from system logs.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events are related to PowerShell.exe activities. Specifically, there are multiple instances where PowerShell loads images and creates files. For example, the first few entries show 'powershell.exe' loading various DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. That's normal for PowerShell as it uses .NET components, but I should keep an eye out if these are part of malicious activities.\n\nThen there's a file creation event where a temporary script is created in the user's AppData folder: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_hngxvv3x.rso.ps1'. After that, the same PowerShell process deletes this file. This behavior could be suspicious because creating and immediately deleting a script might indicate an attempt to avoid detection or execute malicious code without leaving evidence.\n\nLooking further down, there are several events where PowerShell is used with specific command lines to remove files. The commands target various paths ending with .bat scripts, each under different directories like \"modulo_principal\" and \"estrutura_logico\". Removing multiple script files in a row might be part of cleaning up after executing something malicious or removing traces.\n\nAdditionally, there are events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. While this isn't directly suspicious on its own, the combination with PowerShell activities could raise flags if these changes are unexpected or unauthorized.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple file deletions using PowerShell targeting specific script files, combined with loading of .NET components which can be used for obfuscation or malicious purposes, and the creation\/deletion of a temporary PowerShell script—all these points suggest potential malicious activity. The fact that several scripts are being removed in sequence might indicate an attempt to erase evidence after executing some harmful task.\n\nI'm 85% confident that this batch is interesting because it shows signs of possible unauthorized access or malicious behavior, particularly the repeated deletions and the temporary script handling.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities including loading .NET components, creation of a temporary script file which is then deleted, and subsequent removal of several batch files.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell executions. Each one has a command line that removes specific .bat files with the \"-Force\" flag and ignores errors. That seems suspicious because deleting files without error checking might be part of a script to clean up traces after some malicious activity.\n\nThen there are multiple events where different executables like cmd.exe, sc.exe, and whoami.exe are being run. The commands include stopping and deleting services (like \"sc.exe stop\" and \"delete\"). This could indicate an attempt to disable security features or remove traces of malware from the system.\n\nLooking at the process names, there's a pattern: PowerShell runs several times with different command lines, followed by cmd.exe and sc.exe executions. This sequence might be part of a script that first deletes files using PowerShell and then uses command-line tools to manipulate services. The repeated use of these commands suggests automated behavior, possibly from a script.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry-related events. Processes like conhost.exe, services.exe, and cmd.exe are setting or modifying registry values. Malware often uses the registry to maintain persistence or configure system settings covertly.\n\nThe combination of file deletions, service modifications, and registry changes is red flags for potential malicious activity. The repeated use of these commands across different processes makes it look like a coordinated attack rather than normal user behavior. There's also the fact that some events don't have associated files, which could mean they're part of an initial access or lateral movement phase.\n\nSo putting it all together, this batch shows signs of unauthorized system changes and potential malicious scripting. The consistency in command usage and the nature of the commands themselves make me confident that this activity is worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing Remove-Item commands to delete files, along with other process creations and registry modifications, suggest potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

For instance, creating and then deleting a file in the Temp directory could be part of an attack to remove traces after executing something. Also, accessing registry values and loading various DLLs is common for processes trying to hide their actions.\n\nLooking at all these together, it seems like there's a pattern suggesting potential malicious behavior.

I'm looking at each event one by one and seeing what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe with tasks like Pipe Created and Provider Lifecycle. Powershell is a common tool for both admins and attackers, so repeated activity might be normal but could also indicate something suspicious. The command lines show \"& {}\" which doesn't look immediately malicious, but it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nNext, there are events where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate because Defender uses PowerShell for some tasks. However, sometimes attackers might abuse legitimate processes, so it's something to note.\n\nThen I see a FileCreate event in the user's directory for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is an Elasticsearch tool, so that activity makes sense if someone is managing logs with it. No red flags there.\n\nMoving on, cmd.exe appears multiple times. One instance deletes modulo_base.exe from the Temp folder using del \/f \/q \/s. Deleting files in Temp could be part of a cleanup routine after malicious activity, which raises suspicion. Also, the command line \"\/c del ...\" is executed without much context, which might be a sign of automated or script-based deletion.\n\nThere are several RegistryEvent tasks across powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate operations but also often used by malware to persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nWhoami.exe is run a couple of times. This tool is commonly used to check user permissions, which might indicate someone probing the environment's security setup.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, multiple processes (powershell.exe and cmd.exe) are performing various tasks that could be part of legitimate admin work but also could signify malicious activities like script execution, file deletion, or persistence mechanisms. The combination of these events across different processes and tasks increases the suspicion level.\n\nHowever, without additional context like timestamps showing rapid succession, unusual file paths, or anomalies in user accounts, it's hard to say definitively.

Then I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is executing a command to remove a log file from the TEMP directory, with error action set to ignore. This repeated attempt might indicate an attempt to delete logs to cover tracks.\n\nLooking at other events, there are several Image Load tasks for various DLLs and one File Creation followed by immediate deletion of a script in the Temp folder. The repeated use of powershell.exe with specific command lines raises suspicion because attackers often use PowerShell for scripting malicious activities.\n\nThe justification is that these actions suggest potential malicious behavior like log tampering and script execution, which are common in attacks to evade detection.

Let's start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there are several events where the process is powershell.exe with command lines that seem suspicious. The command line is 'powershell.exe & {}', which looks like it might be trying to execute some script or command. Powershell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities, so repeated executions could indicate something's up.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, most of these powershell.exe events have tasks related to Provider Lifecycle or Engine Lifecycle. Those seem more like normal operations, but I'm not entirely sure. Then there are some FileCreate and RegistryEvent tasks which might be writing to files or modifying the registry—this could be part of malicious activity.\n\nI notice that there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessing processes (ProcessAccess) and creating new processes (Process Create). This chaining of process creations, especially with whoami.exe being called a few times, stands out. Whoami.exe is typically used to check user permissions, which attackers might use to escalate privileges or gather information.\n\nAnother point is the file paths mentioned. For example, MpClient.dll is related to Windows Defender, so that's legitimate. But there are also entries like .winlogbeat.yml.new and a path under AppData for PowerShell StartupProfileData. These could be areas where malicious scripts might store data or configuration, especially if they're using non-standard locations.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe with varying command lines but all within the same context (like user fiddelis) makes me think it's part of a script or automated process. Maybe someone is trying to execute commands in a way that avoids detection, or perhaps it's part of a larger attack chain like lateral movement.\n\nPutting this together, there are multiple indicators pointing towards potential malicious activity: repeated powershell.exe executions with suspicious command lines, file and registry modifications, process access events, and the use of whoami.exe.
