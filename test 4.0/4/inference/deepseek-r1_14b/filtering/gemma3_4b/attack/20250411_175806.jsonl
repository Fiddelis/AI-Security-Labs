{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and creating files. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously. The use of Registry modifications with cmd.exe and reg.exe also stands out because attackers often use the registry to maintain persistence.\n\nI see commands like REG ADD targeting the Run key in the HKCU hive, which is a typical way for malware to ensure it runs on startup. This indicates possible persistence mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation by powershell.exe at 'modulo_padrao.txt', and winlogbeat creating files related to its configuration. While winlogbeat might be legitimate, the combination with other suspicious activities raises concern.\n\nThe events span various timestamps, showing multiple attempts to modify the system through processes like cmd.exe, reg.exe, and conhost.exe. This pattern suggests a potential attack chain, possibly involving persistence, file creation for malicious purposes, and registry modifications to hide traces.\n\nOverall, the repeated use of powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and reg.exe with suspicious commands indicates possible malicious activity, making this batch relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and files, along with registry modifications using cmd.exe and reg.exe, suggest potential malicious activities such as persistence or file creation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
