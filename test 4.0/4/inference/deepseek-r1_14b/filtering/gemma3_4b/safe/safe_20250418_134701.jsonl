They all have similar structures with \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" sections. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\". The winlog task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", meaning a file was created. The file paths are in the same directory but different files, all under \"node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\fp\\\\\".\n\nSo each event is about git creating a file in that specific node_modules folder.

Since git.exe is typically used for version control, especially in a development environment, this activity seems normal when someone is working on code that involves Cypress and Lodash types.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. There's no indication of unusual file paths, execution of scripts, or access to sensitive areas outside the project directory. All activities are contained within a standard node_modules folder, which is common in JavaScript\/TypeScript projects.\n\nConsidering the context, if this log was captured during normal development work, especially where someone is setting up or modifying their project's type definitions, it wouldn't raise any red flags.

The task in each event is \"File created\", which indicates that a file was made. This alone might not raise flags because legitimate processes like Git do create files regularly.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to a user's Downloads folder within a specific course directory for \"Qualidade de Software\". The files are TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) located in the node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\/ directory. This suggests these are part of the Cypress testing framework's type definitions for Lodash functions.\n\nSince the process is Git and the files are standard in a development environment, especially if someone is working with Node.js and Cypress, this activity seems normal.

This repetition suggests it's part of a normal operation rather than something malicious or out of the ordinary.\n\nConsidering the file paths, they all end with `.d.ts`, which indicates they're TypeScript declaration files. These are standard in many JavaScript\/TypeScript projects, especially when using tools like Cypress. The files listed, such as `isError.d.ts` and `isNumber.d.ts`, are typical utility type definitions often used in software development.\n\nThe fact that all these events are occurring within the context of a git process further supports the idea that this is part of a legitimate build or setup activity. It's common for developers to clone repositories, install dependencies (which might involve node modules), and set up their environment using git.\n\nI don't see any unusual file names or locations here. The paths are deep within a project structure, which aligns with how development tools typically organize files. There's no indication of system-wide changes, access to sensitive areas, or multiple processes being involved beyond the expected `git.exe`.\n\nGiven all this, it seems like these events are just part of a developer setting up their environment or running some scripts as part of their workflow.

Each event is a JSON object representing something that happened on the system. The first thing I notice is that all these events are from the same process: git.exe. That's interesting because Git is commonly used for version control and software development.\n\nLooking deeper into each event, they're all categorized under \"winlog\" with the task being \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means that a file was created on the system. The paths mentioned are all located in the \"node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\\" directory, followed by different filenames ending with .d.ts.\n\nI know that .d.ts files are TypeScript declaration files used for type definitions. They don't contain executable code but rather metadata about types and modules. Since these files are part of a Cypress setup within a node_modules folder, it suggests that this is related to a development environment where someone might be working on a project using Cypress for testing.\n\nThe fact that multiple .d.ts files are being created in quick succession by git.exe makes me think that perhaps this is during the installation or update process of a package. Node.js modules often require building and installing, which can involve creating new files as part of their setup.\n\nNow, considering whether these events are interesting from a cybersecurity perspective: typically, file creation events related to development tools like Git and npm (Node Package Manager) are common in environments where software is being developed or maintained. Unless there's an unusual pattern, such as files being created outside expected directories or during unexpected times, this might not raise red flags.\n\nI also consider the possibility of these events being part of a malicious activity. Could an attacker be using git.exe to create files? It's possible but less likely in this context because the paths are within a standard node_modules structure. If these were in system directories or outside the project's scope, that would be more concerning.\n\nMoreover, all the file paths follow a predictable naming convention, which aligns with legitimate development practices. There’s no indication of file names that might hint at malicious activities, like scripts with suspicious extensions or names related to known malware.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to monitor file creation events, especially from processes like Git, in this case, the batch seems to be part of normal software development activity.

These events look like they're related to installing dependencies because node_modules is where npm packages go. Lodash is a popular library, so its types are probably being installed here.\n\nIs there anything suspicious? Well, each event is just a file creation by git.exe in a typical development environment.

These tools can create a lot of file events as part of their normal operation, especially during installations or updates. So seeing multiple file creation events from git.exe might just be part of the setup process for someone's development environment.\n\nThe paths are all under node_modules, which is standard for JavaScript packages. Each event creates a .d.ts file, which I think is a TypeScript declaration file. These files are common in Node.js modules to provide type information without needing the actual TypeScript code.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual activity here, like access to sensitive files, attempts to execute scripts, or changes outside the expected development directory. All events are consistent with normal build or setup processes.

The fact that git.exe is creating multiple such files sequentially suggests that this is part of a normal build or installation process where the system is setting up type definitions for the project.\n\nSince all these events occur in the same directory and involve standard tools and processes used in software development, there doesn't seem to be any indication of malicious activity.

The task under winlog is consistently about creating files, specifically mentioning that a file was created with a rule called FileCreate.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all located in a directory structure related to Node.js modules for Cypress. Specifically, it's the types folder within lodash, and each file has a .d.ts extension, which I know is used for TypeScript definition files.\n\nSo, what's happening here? It looks like git.exe is creating multiple files in this specific module path. Since all these events are about file creation by git.exe, it seems like part of a standard Git process—perhaps during cloning or syncing repositories where the tool creates necessary files.\n\nWhy might someone be concerned? Malware often tries to hide its activities by using legitimate tools' processes. However, in this case, the files being created are all standard TypeScript definitions for a testing framework (Cypress). There's no indication of any unusual file names or paths that stand out as suspicious. The repetition is normal when setting up project dependencies.\n\nI should also consider if these events could indicate something like a build process or an automated setup script running, which would not be malicious but routine. Since all the files are part of known modules and their creation isn't unexpected during development setups, there's no red flag here.\n\nAnother angle is checking for any missing information—like user permissions or whether git.exe was run with elevated privileges—but the logs provided don't include that.

The creation of these files by git.exe might be part of a script or automated process during a checkout or update.\n\nIs there anything unusual here? Well, the fact that all events are similar and from the same source doesn't raise any red flags immediately.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, each event is a JSON object, and there are multiple lines. Each line has the same structure: process name is git.exe, task is File created, and file paths are under node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp with various .d.ts files.\n\nHmm, git.exe creating files in the node_modules directory... That seems pretty normal because when you're working with Node.js projects, especially using tools like npm or yarn, git can be part of the process. The node_modules folder is where third-party packages are stored, and these .d.ts files are TypeScript declaration files which are standard in TypeScript projects.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here. All the file paths look like they belong to a typical project setup. No executables being created, no access to sensitive areas, just creating type definitions which are expected when setting up or updating dependencies.\n\nSo putting it all together, this looks like routine activity during development, likely related to installing or updating packages with npm\/yarn. There's nothing malicious or out of the ordinary here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating multiple TypeScript declaration files in a node_modules directory, which is normal during development for projects using Node.js and TypeScript.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. My task is to determine whether the entire batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING.\" I also need to provide a concise justification and a confidence score between 0 and 1.\n\nLooking at the events, they all have similar structures. Each event includes information about a process named \"git.exe,\" a Windows log task indicating that a file was created (rule: FileCreate), and details about the file path. The files being created are TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) located in the node_modules directory under cypress\/types\/lodash.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these events represent. Git is a version control system, so when it's involved, it could be part of a software development workflow. Node modules are packages used in Node.js projects, and cypress refers to the Cypress testing framework. Lodash is a popular utility library for JavaScript. So, this looks like a standard setup for a developer working on a project that uses these tools.\n\nEach event shows git.exe creating a file, but all the files are part of the node_modules directory. This suggests that perhaps the system is building or installing dependencies as part of a package manager operation. In Node.js projects, when you run commands like npm install or yarn add, it's common for files to be created or updated in the node_modules folder.\n\nI notice that all events have similar file paths, just different filenames. For example, there are multiple .d.ts files under cypress\/types\/lodash\/ such as zipWith.d.ts, fromPairs.d.ts, functions.d.ts, etc. These seem like type definitions for Lodash utility functions in TypeScript projects.\n\nNow, considering the possibility of malicious behavior: Is it unusual for git.exe to create files in node_modules? Well, during development, especially when setting up a project or updating dependencies, it's quite normal for the file system to be written to by package managers. Git itself might not directly write to node_modules; instead, scripts or tools that use git could do so.\n\nAnother point is the event task: \"File created.\" On its own, creating files isn't inherently malicious. It could indicate legitimate activity like building a project or installing packages. However, if these events were part of an unusual pattern, such as multiple writes to sensitive directories outside node_modules or from unexpected processes, it might raise flags.\n\nLooking at the process name, git.exe, and considering its typical usage, I don't see any red flags here. The file paths are within a standard project structure, which aligns with development activities rather than malicious ones.\n\nI should also consider the volume of events. There are 14 entries in this batch, all similar. If these were happening over a short period and at an unusual time (like outside business hours), it might warrant closer investigation. However, without context on timing or frequency compared to baseline activity, it's hard to say.\n\nIn terms of potential indicators of compromise (IOC), I don't see any file paths that are commonly associated with malware. The node_modules directory is a standard place for third-party libraries and isn't typically where malicious actors would hide their files unless they're trying to blend in, which is rare but possible. However, given the filenames relate to TypeScript type definitions for Lodash utilities, it's more likely part of a development environment.\n\nThe justification for NOT INTERESTING would be that these events are part of normal software development and dependency management processes. The process name (git.exe) and file paths align with typical activities in such environments. There's no evidence of unusual behavior or signs of malicious activity across the batch.\n\nFor confidence, I'd rate it high because the activities described fit standard development workflows without any indicators pointing to malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating files in a node_modules directory as part of normal software development and dependency management processes, indicating no signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's relevant for investigation. They specified that I should return only one result with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, let me parse through each event. Each event has three main components: process information, Windows log data, and file details. \n\nThe process name is consistently \"git.exe\" across all events. The task in the Windows log is labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates that a file was created. The file paths are all within the same directory structure: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\" followed by different filenames like initial.d.ts, intersection.d.ts, etc.\n\nSo, each event shows that git.exe is creating a file in the node_modules directory under cypress\/types\/lodash. These files are TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) for various lodash functions or utilities. The repeated process name and consistent task suggest that this is part of a larger operation, likely during a software build or installation.\n\nNow, considering what I know about cybersecurity, git.exe is commonly used for version control and isn't inherently malicious. It's a standard tool in development environments. The act of creating multiple files in the node_modules directory also seems normal because node_modules is where npm packages are stored, including Cypress in this case.\n\nThe paths don't seem suspicious either. They're all within user directories and project-specific folders, which aligns with typical developer workflows. There's no indication of file creation outside expected locations or attempts to modify system files, which would be red flags.\n\nI should also consider the context provided by the event types. Since each event is a file creation triggered by git.exe during development activities, it doesn't raise any immediate security concerns. Unless there's evidence that git.exe was compromised or used maliciously, these events appear benign.\n\nMoreover, if this were part of a larger attack, I would expect to see more varied processes and possibly some signs of unauthorized access or privilege escalation. But here, all the indicators point towards legitimate development activities.\n\nTherefore, my analysis leads me to classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no evidence of malicious behavior; it's likely just a developer using git to work on their project.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creations by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development activities and does not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each one is a JSON object, and they all seem to be similar in structure. Let me try to understand what each part means.\n\nFirst, the process name is \"git.exe\" every time. That tells me that Git is being used here, which makes sense because it's a common tool for version control. The next part is \"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)}\", so this indicates that a file was created on Windows. The specific rule they're referencing is for when a file is created.\n\nNow looking at the file paths, all of them are under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\" followed by different filenames ending with .d.ts. These look like TypeScript definition files for Lodash functions. For example, isElement.d.ts, isEmpty.d.ts, and so on.\n\nI notice that each event corresponds to a file being created in the node_modules folder of a Cypress project. Since Git is involved, this might be part of a development workflow where someone is setting up or updating their project dependencies. The creation of multiple files suggests that perhaps something like npm install was run, which would download and extract package files.\n\nI'm thinking about whether these events are unusual. Creating files in node_modules during normal operations is expected when installing packages, especially for tools like Git if they're part of a CI\/CD pipeline or development setup. Since all the file paths are within the project's structure and related to Cypress and Lodash, which are legitimate libraries, there doesn't seem to be any malicious activity here.\n\nCould there be anything suspicious? Maybe if these files were being created outside of normal operations or in unexpected locations, but in this case, everything looks standard. The fact that they're all created by git.exe might raise a question—why would Git create files in node_modules? But I know that sometimes scripts run as part of the build process could involve Git for checking out submodules or specific versions, which is a normal practice.\n\nSo putting it all together, these logs are showing a series of file creations related to a development environment setup. There's no indication of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors. They fit within typical user activity when working with Git and Node.js packages.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities related to a development environment setup using Git and node_modules.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's start by looking at each event individually and then see if there's a pattern when considering them all together.\n\nEach JSON object represents an event where the process name is \"git.exe\". The task in the winlog is \"File created\", which suggests that a file was created. All these events seem to be related to files being created by the git process, but let me check the paths to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\" followed by different filenames like isNumber.d.ts, isObject.d.ts, etc. These look like TypeScript definition files (d.ts) for the Lodash library within a Cypress setup.\n\nCypress is a tool used for testing web applications, and when you set up a project with Cypress, it often installs various dependencies, including Lodash types. The node_modules folder is standard in Node.js projects where all the packages are stored. So each event represents git creating these type definition files as part of the build or setup process.\n\nNow, considering that all events are from the same process (git.exe) and involve the creation of multiple .d.ts files in a typical project structure, this seems like normal activity during development. These files being created by git could be part of cloning a repository, running npm install, or building the project. There's no indication of anything malicious here—no signs of unauthorized access, strange file names, or activities outside of standard operations.\n\nI don't see any red flags such as execution of scripts, changes to system configurations, or attempts to access restricted areas. All the files are within a user's Downloads folder and under a course named \"Qualidade de Software\", which sounds like it's related to software quality—maybe part of an academic project or coursework.\n\nMoreover, since each event is just a file creation by git.exe, there's no evidence of multiple processes involved, unusual timestamps, or geographic locations that might indicate something suspicious. It all fits within the expected behavior when setting up or working on a development project that uses Cypress and Lodash.\n\nSo, putting it all together: same process creating several related files in a standard project structure during typical development activities. No signs of malicious intent or anomalies.

The files being created are various .d.ts files like keyBy.d.ts, keys.d.ts, etc.\n\nFirst, I recognize that git.exe is commonly used for version control, particularly in development environments dealing with JavaScript or TypeScript projects. Since all events show file creation under a node_modules folder, this suggests normal development activity—perhaps during an install or update of dependencies using npm or yarn. The cypress and lodash packages are standard in the npm ecosystem for testing and utility purposes, respectively.\n\nI check if there's any unusual behavior here. Each event is isolated to git.exe creating files within expected locations. There’s no indication of file deletions, access anomalies, or activities outside the scope of typical development workflows. The repetition of similar events might seem repetitive, but in this context, it's normal when multiple files are being handled during a package installation or update.\n\nI also consider if these actions could be part of malicious activity. However, git.exe is a legitimate tool and doesn't typically execute malicious code on its own. Unless there's evidence of unusual command-line arguments or deviations from standard operations, which isn't present here, I don’t see red flags.\n\nThe paths are all within the user's Downloads directory, under a course folder (S206 - Qualidade de Software), indicating this is likely related to educational or project work.

These are used for type definitions in TypeScript projects. So, these files are part of the project's dependencies or configurations.\n\nNow, considering all events together, they all originate from the same process (git.exe), involve the creation of several files in a typical development environment, and are related to TypeScript setup.

Git is commonly used for version control, so it's not unusual to see it in system logs.\n\nThe tasks are all \"File created\" under the same rule. This indicates that files are being created, which is a standard operation, especially during development or when installing software.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're located in a user's Downloads directory within a course folder for \"Qualidade de Software\". The specific files are .d.ts files in the node_modules of Cypress and Lodash. These are typical files found in a Node.js project setup, part of type definitions used by tools like TypeScript.\n\nThe repetition of similar events suggests that multiple files were created during a script execution, perhaps when running npm install or a build process. There's no indication of unusual file names, access patterns, or times that would raise red flags for malicious activity.\n\nConsidering the user context and common development activities, these events don't show signs of suspicious behavior like unexpected file creation in sensitive areas, attempts to modify system files, or multiple failed operations that could indicate a breach.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't present any unusual or concerning patterns. It's likely related to normal software development processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation by git.exe during development activities, which is a common and expected process.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
