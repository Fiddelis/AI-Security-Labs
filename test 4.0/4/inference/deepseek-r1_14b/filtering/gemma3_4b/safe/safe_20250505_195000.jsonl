{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries from \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading different DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll multiple times. That's a bit repetitive but not necessarily suspicious on its own—could be normal process activity.\n\nThen there are events from taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll twice. TaskHostW is related to the Task Scheduler, so this seems legitimate.\n\nThe services.exe process with a logon event catches my eye. Services.exe is part of Windows services, but an unusual logon without context might be worth looking into—could it be a service account or some unauthorized access?\n\nNext, there are multiple Dns query events from SDXHelper.exe. DNS queries themselves aren't bad, but frequent ones could indicate something like domain generation algorithm (DGA) used in malware for command and control. This repetition stands out.\n\nLooking further down, I see powershell.exe being monitored here. It's loading several .NET DLLs which is normal when running scripts, but there's a file created in the Temp folder: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1. PowerShell creating files can be benign or malicious depending on content and context.\n\nAlso, svchost.exe and Explorer.EXE making registry changes—this is common for many processes, but any unexpected registry modifications might indicate tampering.\n\nConsidering all together: multiple DnsQuery events from the same process, file creation by PowerShell in a temporary folder, and an unusual logon event from services.exe. These points suggest possible malicious activity or at least something out of the ordinary that needs closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DNS query events from SDXHelper.exe, file creation by PowerShell in a temporary folder, and unusual logon event from services.exe suggest potential malicious activity or investigation-worthy behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a batch of system logs in JSONL format and wants me to classify the entire batch as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". They also want a concise justification and a confidence score between 0 and 1.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening. \n\nLooking at the first event, there's a PowerShell process deleting a file: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1`. That caught my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Deleting files, especially script-related ones, could be part of an attempt to cover tracks or remove malicious scripts.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from `powershell.exe` related to provider lifecycle and engine lifecycle. These seem like normal operations when PowerShell starts up, so I'm not too concerned about those on their own. But combined with the file deletion, it's something to note.\n\nThen, there's an event where a process named `HxTsr.exe` sets a registry value. Registry modifications can be malicious, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, in combination with other suspicious activities, this might indicate something is off.\n\nI also notice several events involving Python-related processes: `py.exe`, `python.exe`, and various DLLs being loaded. While Python is commonly used for scripting, the presence of multiple instances and specific DLLs could be part of normal operations or potentially malicious activity, like dropping files from a script.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a series of actions that include deleting a PowerShell script, modifying registry entries, and running Python processes. These activities don't definitively prove malicious intent on their own, but they do raise some red flags when considered as a whole. The file deletion could be an attempt to remove evidence, the registry change might be persistence or configuration changes, and the Python scripts could be part of payload execution.\n\nI'm assigning a confidence level because while each event individually isn't conclusive, the combination suggests possible malicious behavior. However, without additional context like timestamps or more detailed process information, it's not certain. So I'll mark this as INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events related to PowerShell activities and file deletions that may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what they might indicate.\n\nThe first two lines are both from python.exe loading images. One loads _ctypes.pyd and the other libffi-8.dll. These seem like standard Python DLLs, so nothing too suspicious there. Maybe someone is running a script that uses these modules.\n\nNext, we have winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. The path seems legitimate, especially since it's an .yml.new file, which could be part of the configuration setup for winlogbeat. I know winlogbeat is used for log shipping, so this might just be setting up its configuration.\n\nThen there are three events from SDXHelper.exe making DNS queries. That's a bit concerning because multiple DNS queries in a short time can sometimes indicate malicious activity, like domain generation algorithm (DGA) checks or command and control communication. But I'm not sure if that's the case here since it's only three instances.\n\nThe last event is RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows' User Account Control (UAC), so this seems normal as it manages user sessions and permissions.\n\nLooking at all these together, most events are routine except for the multiple DNS queries from SDXHelper.exe. However, without more context on what SDXHelper.exe does, it's hard to say if those are malicious or part of legitimate operations. Maybe it's a known process that periodically checks domains as part of its function.\n\nI'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity across the batch, but I'm not 100% certain due to the DNS queries.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include routine system activities such as loading Python DLLs, creating configuration files for winlogbeat, and normal registry operations. The repeated DNS queries by SDXHelper.exe could be suspicious but may also be part of legitimate behavior without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
