{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"Okay, let's break down this log data and analyze what's happening.\n\n**Overall Summary**\n\nThis log sequence shows the creation and startup of a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" using PowerShell.  A script appears to be running that first defines a service, then starts it. The service's executable is located at `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`.  This is followed by several PowerShell tasks that look related to managing\/creating\/starting the service. The service creation commands are repeated multiple times, which is unusual and warrants further investigation.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown of Events**\n\n1. **Initial HTML\/XML Blob (First Entry):** This appears to be an encoded representation of an HTML\/XML document. Its significance isn't immediately clear but could contain configuration information or be related to a scheduled task being executed. The `winlog` section indicates \"Process Create\" – potentially the initial creation of the PowerShell process that is performing the subsequent actions.\n2. **`services.exe` Registry Value Set:** This is a standard Windows service management process, showing an associated Registry modification. This is normal during service operations.\n3. **`sppsvc.exe` Image Loaded:** This involves the Software Protection Platform service. It's potentially loading a DLL (`taskschd.dll`) suggesting potential scheduled task integration.\n4. **`svchost.exe` Registry Value Set:** Another standard Windows service management process.\n5. **Windows Update Agent:** A standard process, seemingly unrelated to the core service creation.\n6. **PowerShell Service Creation (Repeated):** This is the critical section:\n    *   `powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}`\n    *   This PowerShell command does two things:\n        *   **`New-Service`**:  Creates a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\".  The `-BinaryPathName` specifies the executable that runs when the service starts (`C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`).\n        *   **`Start-Service`**:  Starts the service that was just created.\n    *   This command is repeated several times consecutively, which suggests a potential issue: either a loop in the script, a problem with the initial creation, or something retrying the creation due to an error.\n\n7. **\"Engine Lifecycle\" PowerShell Task**: The last entry indicates that the \"Engine Lifecycle\" PowerShell task has been triggered. This usually relates to PowerShell's execution engine.\n\n**Key Points & Potential Concerns**\n\n*   **Service Name:** The name \"objeto_ativo\" (\"active object\" in Portuguese) is somewhat generic, making it harder to identify its purpose.\n*   **Executable Path:** The service executable path `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` is non-standard. You should investigate the purpose of this executable and its origin.  It’s important to understand what it *actually* does.\n*   **Repeated Creation:** The repeated execution of the PowerShell command is highly suspicious. It suggests a potential loop or failure in the process.\n*   **Origin and Trust:**  You need to determine *how* this PowerShell script is being executed.  Who wrote it?  Where did it come from? Is it a legitimate script? It's critical to assess the trustworthiness of the script and its origin.\n*   **\"Engine Lifecycle\"**:  The last PowerShell task, \"Engine Lifecycle,\" could signify an error or unexpected state related to the PowerShell environment.\n\n**Recommendations for Investigation**\n\n1.  **Examine `tarefa_logico.exe`:**\n    *   Determine its origin. Was it placed there intentionally?\n    *   Analyze the executable using a static analysis tool (like VirusTotal or a disassembler) to understand its functionality.\n2.  **Locate the PowerShell Script:** Find the script that contains the PowerShell command and examine its content to understand why it's being executed repeatedly. Look for loops or error-handling mechanisms.\n3.  **Identify the Trigger:**  Determine what initiated the PowerShell script's execution. Is it a scheduled task, a startup script, or something else?\n4.  **Review Scheduled Tasks:** Check your scheduled tasks to see if anything is related to the service creation.\n5.  **Check Startup Scripts:** Review startup scripts (e.g., in the Startup folder or registry keys that run on startup).\n6.  **Monitor Service Status:** Keep a close eye on the \"objeto_ativo\" service to see if it behaves as expected and doesn’s cause any issues.\n7.  **Scan for Malware:** Run a full system scan with a reputable anti-malware solution to rule out the possibility of malware.\n\n**In summary, this log sequence points to potentially unauthorized or suspicious activity. Investigate the PowerShell script, the service executable, and the trigger mechanism immediately.**  A thorough investigation is essential to ensure the integrity and security of your system."}
