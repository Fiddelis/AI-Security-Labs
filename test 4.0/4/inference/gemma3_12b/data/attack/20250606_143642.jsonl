{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This sequence of events suggests a malicious PowerShell script execution followed by cleanup attempts. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Initial Execution & Download\/Decompression:**\n\n1.  **`taskschd.dll`:** The initial task scheduler DLL is loaded, suggesting the malicious activity was initially scheduled.\n2.  **`services.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `svchost.exe`:** Loading of standard Windows services and processes. These are often used as \"blame\" processes during exploitation to obscure the true source.\n3.  **`powershell.exe`:** This marks the start of the malicious script execution.\n4.  **`whoami.exe`:** The `whoami` command is executed within PowerShell. This is often done to verify user privileges and potentially gather information about the system.\n5.  **`powershell.exe` (with download\/unzip):** This is the key malicious command.  It's downloading and then likely unzipping a file (`entrada_principal.zip`). The contents of this zip file are the core of the attack.\n6.  **DLL Loading:** The PowerShell process then loads several .NET framework DLLs (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, etc.). This indicates the script likely uses .NET functionalities for its malicious actions.\n7.  **Defender DLL loading:**  `MpOAV.dll` is loaded. This may indicate the malware tries to interact with or evade Windows Defender.\n\n**Cleanup & Attempted Evasion**\n\n8. **Temporary File Creation:** Creates a temporary PowerShell script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`). This is a common tactic to test PowerShell execution policies or, as seems to be the case here, mask the actual commands within an ostensibly benign script.\n9.  **Temporary File Deletion:** Immediately after creation, the temporary file is deleted (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`). This is a standard cleanup technique to remove traces of the script.\n\n**Key Indicators of Malicious Activity:**\n\n*   **PowerShell Execution:** The frequent use of `powershell.exe` and the complex commands being executed are significant red flags.\n*   **Download and Unzip:** Downloading and extracting a zip file without user consent is highly suspicious. The contents of `entrada_principal.zip` would need to be investigated.\n*   **Cleanup\/Evasion Tactics:** The deletion of the temporary PowerShell script file is a clear attempt to cover up the attacker's tracks.\n*   **.NET Framework Loading:** Use of .NET framework libraries implies more complex, and likely malicious, script functionalities.\n*   **Windows Defender Interaction**: The loading of a Defender DLL can be a sign of the script trying to evade detection.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Investigate `entrada_principal.zip`:** This is the most critical step.  Analyze the contents of this zip file to understand the script's full purpose and payload.  **Do not execute it.**\n2.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) or Antivirus:** Review logs and scan the system with a robust antivirus\/EDR solution.  Look for any remaining artifacts.\n3.  **Review Scheduled Tasks:** Examine the task scheduler for any suspicious or unauthorized scheduled tasks that might have been created to execute this script.  Look for unusual names or triggers.\n4.  **PowerShell Execution Policies:** Review and tighten PowerShell execution policies to restrict the ability of unsigned scripts to run.\n5.  **Monitor PowerShell Activity:**  Implement PowerShell auditing and logging to detect unusual PowerShell activity in the future.\n6.  **User Education:** Educate users about the dangers of opening unexpected files or running scripts from untrusted sources.\n\n**To provide more specific analysis, I would need the contents of `entrada_principal.zip`.**  However, based on the events described, this sequence strongly suggests a malware infection."}
