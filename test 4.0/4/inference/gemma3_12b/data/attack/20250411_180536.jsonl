Coupled with registry modifications by numerous processes (including cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe) and the presence of winlogbeat activity (creation of configuration files), this suggests possible malicious activity or at least warrants closer inspection.
