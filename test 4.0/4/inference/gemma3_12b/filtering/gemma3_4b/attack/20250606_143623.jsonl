{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"This log snippet indicates a potential malicious activity involving the creation and starting of a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" using PowerShell. Here's a breakdown and analysis:\n\n**Key Observations & Concerns:**\n\n* **PowerShell Service Creation:** The core activity is the use of `New-Service` and `Start-Service` commands within a PowerShell script. This is a red flag. Legitimate software typically doesn't create services this way without a clear purpose and user consent.\n* **Service Name - \"objeto_ativo\":**  The service name itself, \"objeto_ativo\" (which translates to \"active object\" in Portuguese), is suspicious.  It's a generic name that could be used to disguise malicious intent.\n* **Binary Path - `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`:** This is *extremely* concerning.\n    * **Non-Standard Location:** The path is unusual and unlikely to be a standard Windows system file or a well-known application.  Malware often places executables in obscure locations to evade detection.\n    * **Portuguese Path Elements:**  The path elements (`unidade_logico`, `registro_comum`, `entrada_base`) are in Portuguese. This suggests the attacker might be targeting a system where Portuguese is a primary language or has been specifically configured to use Portuguese file names.\n    * **`tarefa_logico.exe`:**  The name \"tarefa_logico.exe\" (meaning \"logical task.exe\") is also suspicious, designed to sound innocuous.\n* **`-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`:**  The PowerShell command includes `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`. While it *sounds* restrictive, it means the script is *deliberately* attempting to execute despite the system's default execution policy.  This is often a sign of a malicious attempt to bypass security measures.  A legitimate application would rarely need to run with such an override.\n* **Repetitive Execution:** The `New-Service` and `Start-Service` commands are executed multiple times in a short period.  This could be due to:\n    * **Retry Mechanism:** A malicious script might retry creating and starting the service if the initial attempt fails.\n    * **Script Replication:** The script might be being executed multiple times by different triggers.\n* **`Write-Host 'Final result: 1'`:** This command executes in PowerShell. It doesn't directly indicate malicious behavior on its own but can be used to check if the code completed successfully.\n\n**Likely Malicious Activity:**\n\nBased on these observations, this is almost certainly a malicious script attempting to:\n\n1. **Install a Backdoor\/Persistence Mechanism:** The created service, `objeto_ativo`, is likely a backdoor or some other form of persistent malware.  The executable `tarefa_logico.exe` is almost certainly malicious.  Services persist across reboots, providing a way for the attacker to maintain access to the system.\n2. **Bypass Security Measures:** The use of `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` suggests a deliberate attempt to bypass security.\n3. **Maintain Persistence:** The created service ensures the malicious executable will run automatically each time the system starts, giving the attacker continued access.\n\n**Recommendations (Urgent Actions Required):**\n\n1. **Isolate the System:** Immediately disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further communication with the attacker's command-and-control server.\n2. **Scan with Updated Antivirus\/EDR:** Run a full system scan with up-to-date antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) software.\n3. **Examine `tarefa_logico.exe`:**  If possible, obtain a copy of the `tarefa_logico.exe` file and submit it to a malware analysis service (e.g., VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis) to determine its exact purpose.\n4. **Delete the Service:**  Delete the \"objeto_ativo\" service using the Services app (`services.msc`) or PowerShell ( `Remove-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"`).  **Important:**  Make sure you understand the potential consequences of removing a service.\n5. **Investigate the Root Cause:**  Determine how the PowerShell script was executed.  Was it downloaded from a malicious website? Was it delivered via email?  Was it installed by a compromised user? This is critical to prevent future infections.\n6. **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Assess the system's PowerShell execution policies and ensure they are set to a secure level (e.g., `Restricted` or `AllSigned`).\n7. **Monitor for Similar Activity:**  Continuously monitor the system for other suspicious PowerShell activity.\n8. **Consider Forensic Analysis:**  If the data on the system is critical, consider engaging a digital forensics expert to perform a thorough analysis.\n9. **Incident Response Plan:** This incident should trigger your organization’s incident response plan.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide definitive malware analysis.
