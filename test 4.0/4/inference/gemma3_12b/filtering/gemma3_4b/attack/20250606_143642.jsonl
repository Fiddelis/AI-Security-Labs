{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Okay, let's break down this sequence of events and analyze the likely malicious activity.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\nThis sequence describes a PowerShell-driven attack.  It starts with the execution of a `taskschd.dll` script, then downloads and executes a zip file, and finally attempts to remove traces of its activity. The attacker seems to be trying to bypass PowerShell execution policy and is likely attempting to execute malicious code.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown & Analysis:**\n\n1.  **`services.exe` - Registry Value Set:** This is a normal system process. The Registry event is likely a benign side effect of other processes.\n2.  **`sppsvc.exe` - Image Loaded - `taskschd.dll`:**  `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Service) loading `taskschd.dll` (Task Scheduler DLL) is unusual and a red flag.  It suggests a task scheduler component is being manipulated or misused. This is a common method for attackers to set up persistence. The downloaded zip file contains a malicious task.\n3.  **`svchost.exe` - Registry Value Set:** Similar to the first Registry event, this is likely a normal side effect of other processes.\n4.  **`powershell.exe` - Process Accessed:** This is where the attack truly begins.  PowerShell is now being directly used.\n5.  **`whoami.exe` - Process Create:** This is likely to identify the user's context.\n6.  **`powershell.exe` - Process Accessed and Registry Value Set:** More PowerShell activity and another Registry modification.\n7.  **`powershell.exe` - Process Create â€“ `Remove-Item`:** The attacker is now actively attempting to delete the downloaded file (`entrada_principal.zip`) from the Temp folder. This is an obvious attempt to cover their tracks and prevent forensic analysis. This command suggests the downloaded zip contained a script named `entrada_principal.zip`.\n8.  **Multiple `powershell.exe` - Image Loads (various DLLs):**  PowerShell is now loading a *lot* of .NET framework DLLs (`mscoreei.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.dll`, etc.). This indicates the malicious PowerShell script is heavily reliant on .NET functionality, and likely performing complex operations (cryptography, network communication, etc.).\n9.   **`powershell.exe` - File Created\/Deleted:** `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` script created and immediately deleted. This is an evasion technique. The PowerShell execution policy bypasses security measures.\n\n**Key Indicators of Malicious Activity:**\n\n*   **Unusual DLL Loading from `sppsvc.exe`:**  `sppsvc.exe` loading `taskschd.dll` is a deviation from its normal behavior and indicates compromise.\n*   **Direct PowerShell Execution:**  Direct use of `powershell.exe` is frequently associated with malicious activity.\n*   **File Deletion:** The `Remove-Item` command attempting to delete `entrada_principal.zip` is a strong sign of a cover-up attempt.\n*   **PowerShell Execution Policy Bypass:** It's very likely the attacker bypassed PowerShell's execution policy to run their script.\n*   **.NET Framework Dependency:** The large number of .NET framework DLLs loaded suggests a complex, potentially obfuscated script.\n*   **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion:**  Creating and quickly deleting files in temporary directories (like the `__PSScriptPolicyTest...ps1` file) is a common way to hide evidence.\n\n**Likely Attack Scenario:**\n\n1.  An attacker gained access to the system.\n2.  They downloaded a zip file containing a malicious PowerShell script.\n3.  The task scheduler (manipulated by `sppsvc.exe`) automatically executed the PowerShell script.\n4.  The PowerShell script downloaded and ran another script potentially obfuscated\n5.  The PowerShell script immediately attempted to remove itself (`entrada_principal.zip`).\n6.  The PowerShell script might have established persistence (e.g., creating a scheduled task, modifying the registry) or executed a more dangerous payload.\n\n**Recommendations (Response and Remediation):**\n\n*   **Isolate the System:**  Disconnect the infected machine from the network immediately to prevent further spread.\n*   **Forensic Analysis:**  Perform a thorough forensic analysis of the system to determine the full extent of the compromise.  Look for scheduled tasks, suspicious registry entries, and other signs of persistence.\n*   **Malware Scan:** Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/antimalware tools.\n*   **Review Task Scheduler:** Carefully review all scheduled tasks for any suspicious entries.\n*   **Review PowerShell Execution Policy:** Enforce a restrictive PowerShell execution policy to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.\n*   **Investigate Network Traffic:** Examine network traffic to identify the source of the malicious download and any communication with command-and-control servers.\n*   **Patch System:** Ensure the system is fully patched with the latest security updates.\n*   **User Education:**  Educate users about the dangers of opening suspicious attachments and clicking on links from unknown sources.\n\n\n\n**To help me provide a more targeted analysis, could you tell me:**\n\n*   Is there more data available (e.g., network traffic logs, full process tree information)?\n*   What is the context of the system this occurred on (e.g., home computer, corporate server)?\n*   What endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution, if any, is in place?"}
