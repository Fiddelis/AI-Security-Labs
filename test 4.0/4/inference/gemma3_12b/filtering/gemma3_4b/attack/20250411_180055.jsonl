This pattern, along with multiple DLL loads (mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, clrjit.dll) strongly suggests a potential scripting or malware activity involving PowerShell execution and potentially .NET-based components. The file paths involve unusual names like 'elemento_padrao', 'objeto_secundario', and 'unidade_comum', which could be indicative of obfuscation or custom scripts.
