Winlogbeat Installation and Configuration**\n\n*   **File Creation:**  Multiple events show the creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new`. This clearly indicates Winlogbeat is being installed or reconfigured. The `.new` extension suggests a new configuration file is being generated.\n\n**2. System Services and Processes**\n\n*   **Sppsvc.exe (Software Protection Service):**  Image loaded. This is a core Windows service related to software licensing. Its presence is normal.\n*   **Svchost.exe:** Multiple Registry events.  `Svchost.exe` hosts several Windows services. The registry events are likely related to those services initializing or updating their configurations.\n*   **Chrome.exe:**  Numerous Registry Value Set events.  This indicates Chrome is making changes to its configuration.  This is normal Chrome behavior, but monitoring *what* registry values are being changed could be useful for security investigations.\n\n**3. Potential Security\/Malware Indicators (Needs further investigation)**\n\n*   **SDXHelper.exe:**  Image loaded, using `combase.dll` and `urlmon.dll`.  `SDXHelper.exe` isn't a standard Windows process. The fact that it's using `urlmon.dll` (related to URL handling and potentially downloading content) is suspicious. It warrants **further investigation** to determine its origin and purpose.  This could be a malicious program.\n\n**4.  Normal Windows Operations**\n\n*   **Image Loaded:** `winlogbeat.exe`, `smartscreen.exe`. Windows doing what it does.\n\n**Summary & Recommendations**\n\n*   **Prioritize Investigation:** The `SDXHelper.exe` events are the most concerning.  You should:\n    *   Determine the origin of `SDXHelper.exe`. Where did it come from?  What is its purpose?\n    *   Examine the commands and arguments associated with this process.\n    *   Scan the system with a reputable antivirus and anti-malware tool.\n*   **Monitor Chrome Registry Changes:** Track what registry keys Chrome is modifying.  If you see unexpected or suspicious changes, it could be an indicator of a browser extension issue or malicious activity.\n*   **Check Winlogbeat Configuration:**  Confirm that the Winlogbeat configuration is correct and secure. The `.new` file being created is expected during initial setup or configuration changes.\n\n\n\n**To help me provide a more targeted assessment, please tell me:**\n\n*   **What is the context of these logs?**  Are you troubleshooting a specific issue, conducting a security audit, or something else?\n*   **Do you recognize the `SDXHelper.exe` process?**  Is it a legitimate application you installed, or is it new?\n*   **What security tools are currently in place?** (Antivirus, EDR, etc.)"}
