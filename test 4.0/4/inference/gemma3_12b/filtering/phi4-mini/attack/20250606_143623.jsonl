{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The logs indicate a series of PowerShell commands being executed, which are creating and starting a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\".  Here's a breakdown of what's happening and potential concerns:\n\n**What's Happening:**\n\n1. **PowerShell Execution:**  The logs repeatedly show `powershell.exe` being invoked.  The `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` argument is used, which generally restricts PowerShell script execution, but it's being bypassed.  This is a *red flag* (see \"Important Considerations\" below).\n2. **Service Creation:** The core of the PowerShell command is:\n   * `New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"`: This creates a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\".  Crucially, it specifies the executable path as `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`.  This is the file that the service will run.\n   * `Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"`: This starts the newly created service.\n3. **Final Result Test:** After the service is created and started, there are `Write-Host 'Final result: 1'` commands. This is likely a rudimentary test to ensure the PowerShell script completed successfully.\n4. **Lifecycle events:** The PowerShell commands are triggering lifecycle events like \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\". These indicate the start and operation of the service.\n\n**Important Considerations (Potential Risks & Concerns):**\n\n* **Circumventing Execution Policy:** The `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` argument, combined with the script still running, is concerning.  It means someone is deliberately bypassing a security restriction. This is a significant risk.\n* **Unusual Path:** The path `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` is highly suspicious.  It's not a standard Windows directory.  This suggests a custom application or a malicious payload being installed.  You *must* investigate the file `tarefa_logico.exe`.\n* **Custom Service:**  The creation of a custom Windows service (\"objeto_ativo\") without proper authorization is a major red flag.  Services run with elevated privileges and can have a wide-ranging impact on the system.\n* **Malware Potential:** This sequence of events is *highly indicative* of malware installation or a potentially malicious process.  The creation of a service is a common tactic for persistence, allowing the malware to automatically run after reboots.\n* **Investigation Required:**  **Immediate and thorough investigation is essential.**  You need to determine the source of the PowerShell commands, the purpose of `tarefa_logico.exe`, and whether this activity is authorized.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Isolate the System:** Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread of any potential malware.\n2. **Analyze `tarefa_logico.exe`:**\n   * **VirusTotal Scan:** Upload the file to VirusTotal (www.virustotal.com) to see if it’s identified as malicious.\n   * **Static Analysis:** Use tools like PEiD, Detect It Easy (DIE), or a disassembler (like Ghidra or IDA Pro) to examine the file's structure and contents.  Look for unusual behavior, embedded strings, or signs of packing\/obfuscation.\n   * **Dynamic Analysis (Sandbox):** If you're skilled, run the file in a controlled sandbox environment to observe its actions without risking your primary system.\n3. **Review PowerShell Execution Logs:**  Examine the system's PowerShell execution logs (if available) to identify the command source.\n4. **Check Scheduled Tasks:**  See if the PowerShell script is being run as a scheduled task.\n5. **Audit User Accounts:** Review user accounts with the ability to create services.\n6. **Malware Scan:** Run a full system scan with an up-to-date anti-malware solution.\n7. **Review System Configuration:** Analyze system configuration files and registry entries for any signs of tampering.\n8. **Reimage\/Clean System:** As a precautionary measure, consider reimaging the system to ensure complete removal of any potential malware.\n\n\n\n**To help me give you more specific advice, can you tell me:**\n\n*   What type of system is this? (Windows Server? Desktop?)\n*   Do you have any information about why this service might have been created?\n*   Do you have access to the original PowerShell script?"}
