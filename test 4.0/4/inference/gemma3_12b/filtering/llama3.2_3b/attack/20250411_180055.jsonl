While the compressed archives themselves aren't inherently malicious, the repeated use of Compress-Archive, combined with the obfuscated paths ('modulo_temporario', 'unidade_secundario', etc.) is a strong indicator of potential data exfiltration or malicious activity. The file deletion event and registry modifications also contribute to the suspicion.
