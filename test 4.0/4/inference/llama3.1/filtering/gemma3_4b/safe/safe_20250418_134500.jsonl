Here's a breakdown of some key events:\n\n**Process Creation**\n\n- **notepad.exe**: Notepad was launched.\n- **Explorer.EXE**: The Explorer process (usually the File Explorer) is involved in setting a registry value.\n\n**File Operations**\n\n- **C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\Cache\\0119e1000c0b37d7bf0cbfcf99429ea7a6b906fb**: This file was created by `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows service process. However, the specific path indicates it's related to Microsoft's Delivery Optimization feature.\n- **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Download\\{56EB18F8-B008-4CBD-B6D2-8C97FE7E9062}\\135.0.3179.73\\MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe**: A file was created by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in the Edge browser's download directory.\n- **C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\{4BB03C95-29DA-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe**: This file was deleted by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in the temporary directory.\n\n**Registry Changes**\n\n- **Explorer.EXE**: The Explorer process made a registry change, which is a normal action for many Windows processes as they initialize or configure their environment.\n\n**Dns Query**\n\n- **CompatTelRunner.exe**: Made a DNS query, which could be related to updating or checking the system's compatibility settings.\n\n**Security**\n\n- **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe**: Performed a file deletion that was logged as detected by the system. This might indicate an issue with the update process, but without more context, it's hard to say for sure if this is malicious activity or just a glitch in the system.\n\nThese logs do not appear to contain any signs of severe security breaches or malware infections based on the information provided. However, specific actions like file deletions can be indicative of potential issues that should be investigated further, especially if they occur frequently or are accompanied by other suspicious behavior."}
