{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"This is a log of system calls and events that appear to be related to a potential malware or intrusion attempt on a Windows system. Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**Initial events**\n\n* The log shows multiple instances of `powershell.exe` processes being launched, often with unusual command lines.\n* Some of these commands involve downloading scripts from a GitHub repository (raw.githubusercontent.com).\n* One notable script is \"WinPwn.ps1\" which is downloaded and executed by the `iex` (Invoke-Expression) cmdlet.\n\n**Downloaded scripts**\n\n* The WinPwn.ps1 script appears to be the primary payload, and it's being used to execute additional commands.\n* The script is downloading and executing a tool called \"sensitivefiles\" with options `-noninteractive -consoleoutput`.\n\n**Tool behavior**\n\n* The sensitivefiles tool seems to be designed to gather sensitive information from the system, possibly including:\n\t+ User account details\n\t+ System configuration data\n\t+ Network connections and settings\n\n**WinPwn.ps1 script**\n\n* The WinPwn.ps1 script appears to be a sophisticated tool with various modules and functions.\n* It's using the `net.webclient` class to download additional scripts and resources from the internet.\n\n**Possible intentions**\n\n* Based on the behavior observed, it's likely that this is an attempted malware or intrusion scenario, where the attackers are attempting to gather sensitive information and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.\n\nTo mitigate these types of attacks, it's essential to:\n\n1. **Keep your Windows and PowerShell versions up-to-date**.\n2. **Use a reputable antivirus solution** to detect and block malicious scripts and executables.\n3. **Monitor your network traffic** for suspicious connections and downloads.\n4. **Implement strict access controls** on sensitive files and directories.\n\nIf you suspect that your system has been compromised, it's crucial to:\n\n1. **Disconnect from the internet** immediately.\n2. **Run a full scan with your antivirus solution**.\n3. **Reboot in safe mode** (if possible) and attempt to isolate the affected components.\n4. **Consult with an IT professional or security expert** for further guidance on remediation and prevention.\n\nKeep in mind that this analysis is based solely on the log data provided, and it's essential to investigate further to determine the actual intentions of the actors involved."}
