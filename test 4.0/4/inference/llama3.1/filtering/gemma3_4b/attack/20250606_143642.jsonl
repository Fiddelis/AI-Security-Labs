{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The provided data appears to be a series of JSON objects, each containing information about a process, Windows log event, and file activity. The structure of each object includes:\n\n- `process`: An object with details about the process that triggered the event, including its name.\n- `winlog`: An object with details about the Windows log event that was recorded, including the task (e.g., \"Process Create,\" \"Registry value set\").\n- `file`: An object containing information about files related to the event, such as their paths.\n\nHere's a breakdown of some key findings and observations:\n\n1. **PowerShell Usage**: The majority of events are related to PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`), suggesting that this system is under attack or compromised, with attackers leveraging PowerShell for malicious activities.\n   \n2. **File Operations**: There are several instances where files are being created (`File created (rule: FileCreate)`), deleted, and accessed. This could indicate an attempt to establish persistence on the system by creating scripts or other files that can run in the future.\n\n3. **Image Loading**: Many events mention image loading (`Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)`), which is a legitimate process but can also be used for malicious purposes. The presence of this action in multiple PowerShell executions suggests that attackers might be dynamically loading modules to execute specific tasks without leaving behind any artifacts.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**: There are records of registry value modifications (`Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)`), which could indicate attempts by the attacker to install malware, modify system settings for persistence, or evade detection mechanisms.\n\n5. **Malicious Commands**: Some events mention command-line arguments that are indicative of malicious intentions. For example, one event contains a PowerShell command line that includes `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`, which suggests an attempt to delete files in the temporary directory related to \"entrada_principal.zip\".\n\n6. **Process Access**: Several events mention process access (`Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)`), indicating interactions with other processes on the system, potentially for privilege escalation or creating backdoors.\n\nGiven this analysis, it appears that the system under observation is experiencing a series of targeted attacks aimed at establishing persistence and executing malicious scripts through PowerShell. It's crucial to analyze these events in more detail and correlate them with other security information to understand the full scope of the attack and take appropriate mitigation measures."}
