{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This is a JSON output that contains information about Windows events, processes, and files. Each object in the array represents a single event or occurrence on the system.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the structure:\n\n* `process`: Contains information about a process running on the system, including its name and command line.\n* `winlog`: Contains information about a Windows event, including the task type (e.g., \"Process Create\", \"Image loaded\") and any relevant details.\n* `file`: Contains information about a file that was accessed or modified by a process.\n\nThe events in this output appear to be related to a malware infection. Some of the suspicious activities include:\n\n* The creation of new processes with names like \"sppsvc.exe\" and \"powershell.exe\", which may be used for malicious purposes.\n* Registry value set events, which could indicate changes to system settings or configuration.\n* Image loaded events, which suggest that malware is being loaded into memory.\n* Process accessed events, which may indicate attempts by the malware to access sensitive files or data.\n\nThe file information suggests that the malware is attempting to load certain DLLs (dynamic link libraries) from the Windows System32 and Microsoft.NET directories. These DLLs are likely used for malicious purposes, such as injecting code into legitimate processes or communicating with a command-and-control server.\n\nOverall, this output appears to indicate a significant security threat on the system, and further investigation is recommended to determine the full extent of the malware infection."}
