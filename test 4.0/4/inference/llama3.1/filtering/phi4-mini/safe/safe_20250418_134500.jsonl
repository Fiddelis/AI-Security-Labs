{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"It appears that you have a JSON log file containing Windows event logs in the Winlogbeat format. Here's an analysis of the data:\n\n**Processes:**\n\n* `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is running multiple times, with different execution contexts (e.g., image loaded, process created, terminated).\n* `winlogbeat.exe` is also running multiple times, creating files in the download directory.\n* Other processes like `svchost.exe`, `Explorer.EXE`, and `notepad.exe` are also present.\n\n**File Events:**\n\n* Multiple files are being created in various directories (e.g., Windows Logs, User Downloads).\n* Some files have their creation time changed (e.g., `setup.exe` in the EdgeUpdate install directory).\n\n**Registry Events:**\n\n* The `RuntimeBroker.exe` process sets registry values.\n* The `Explorer.EXE` process also sets registry values.\n\n**Security-Related Events:**\n\n* A file deletion is logged for a temporary file created by MicrosoftEdgeUpdate ( `{4BB03C95-29DA-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`).\n* DNS queries are recorded, potentially indicating network activity.\n\n**Other Events:**\n\n* Multiple process accesses (e.g., `ProcessAccess`) and image loads (e.g., `ImageLoad`) are logged for MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.\n* A file create event is logged for a Winlogbeat configuration file (`winlogbeat.yml.new`).\n\nThis analysis highlights various system activities, including process execution, file creation\/deletion, registry changes, and network activity. If you're investigating security-related issues or monitoring system behavior, this data may provide valuable insights.\n\nTo further analyze the data, consider using a log analytics tool like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to parse and visualize the events. You can also filter the data based on specific event types or processes to focus on areas of interest."}
