The repetitive network connections by `chrome.exe` could indicate data exfiltration or communication with a command-and-control server. Multiple registry modifications by `chrome.exe`, which is unusual for this process, suggest potential malware behavior. Additionally, the actions of `powershell.exe`, including file creation in user downloads and frequent registry modifications, align with typical attack patterns. The presence of an uncommon executable like `SDXHelper.exe` loading a system DLL (`urlmon.dll`) may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
