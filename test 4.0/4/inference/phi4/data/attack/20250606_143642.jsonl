{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The log entries you provided seem to detail a sequence of events on a Windows system, specifically related to processes and file operations. Here's an analysis based on these logs:\n\n### Process Activity\n\n1. **Processes Created:**\n   - `services.exe`: Indicates the creation of a system process that manages system services.\n   - `sppsvc.exe`: This is associated with Microsoft Software Protection Platform service, which handles activation and protection against software piracy.\n   - `svchost.exe`: A generic host process for services. It can run multiple Windows services in its own process space.\n   - `whoami.exe`: Used to display the user account name associated with the currently effective user token.\n   - **Powershell.exe**: Multiple entries show this script being executed, which indicates it might be used for administrative tasks or potentially malicious activities.\n\n2. **Commands Executed:**\n   - The PowerShell command shown is designed to remove files from a specific directory (`C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe`).\n   - Another command using PowerShell deletes all files in `C:\\Windows\\System32` directory related to \"entrada_principal.zip\".\n\n3. **Image Load Events:**\n   - Various DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) are loaded by PowerShell, including those associated with the .NET Framework (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) and Windows Defender components.\n\n4. **Registry Operations:**\n   - There are multiple entries for registry value sets, typically indicating configuration changes or checks being made by processes like `svchost.exe` or PowerShell scripts.\n\n### File Activity\n\n1. **File Creation and Deletion:**\n   - A temporary file is created under `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp` with the name `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`, which suggests that a PowerShell script might be tested or executed.\n   - This same file is then deleted, as noted by \"File Delete logged.\"\n\n### Analysis and Potential Concerns\n\n- **Potential Malicious Activity:**\n  - The use of `powershell.exe` for deleting files (`entrada_principal.zip`) could indicate malicious intent if the deletion was unauthorized. However, it might also be part of a cleanup operation.\n  - Creation and immediate deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts can sometimes relate to attempts at obfuscation or testing script execution policies.\n\n- **System Administration:**\n  - The presence of `services.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are normal and expected as part of regular system operations. \n\n- **Security Monitoring:**\n  - Windows Defender is actively involved, suggesting that security mechanisms are operational.\n  \nOverall, while some activities might be benign or administrative in nature, the manipulation of files through PowerShell warrants scrutiny, especially if these actions were not authorized by the user or IT administrators. If there's concern about potential unauthorized access or malware, further investigation and possibly consulting with cybersecurity professionals would be advisable."}
