{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The provided logs detail a series of system events primarily involving processes and file actions on a Windows machine. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key activities:\n\n1. **Process Creation:**\n   - Several instances where new processes are created, specifically `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `svchost.exe`.\n   - Commands executed include running PowerShell to remove files from the temporary directory.\n\n2. **Image Loading:**\n   - The logs show that certain DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) were loaded into memory by various processes:\n     - `taskschd.dll` was loaded by `sppsvc.exe`, indicating interaction with Task Scheduler.\n     - `mscoree.dll` and `clr.dll` were loaded by `powershell.exe`, suggesting the use of .NET Framework functionalities within PowerShell sessions.\n\n3. **Registry Interactions:**\n   - There are entries showing that registry values were set, possibly for configuration or persistence purposes, though specific keys or values aren't detailed in the logs.\n\n4. **File Actions:**\n   - A notable file action is the deletion of files from `C:\\Windows\\Temp`, specifically targeting `entrada_principal.zip`.\n\n5. **Access Monitoring:**\n   - The logs also include access monitoring for processes like `powershell.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which could be part of security or auditing measures.\n\nOverall, these logs suggest a scenario where PowerShell is being used to manage files (deletion in this case) and possibly configure system settings via the registry. It might indicate routine maintenance, scripting activities, or potentially malicious behavior depending on context and permissions involved."}
