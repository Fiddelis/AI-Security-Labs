These events include registry modifications (RegistryEvent), process access operations (ProcessAccess), and command-line queries of sensitive areas like the disk enumeration key in the registry. The frequent use of svchost.exe to create files and set registry values is suspicious because svchost can be abused by malware to hide its presence.
