Typically, legitimate use of Discord would not involve numerous and repeated network connections or extensive pipe creations unless in the context of specific features or integrations. Furthermore, the occurrence of a registry modification and process access events may indicate potential tampering or exploitation attempts. The combination of these activities suggests that further investigation is warranted to determine if malicious behavior is involved. While Discord.exe can perform legitimate networking tasks, such as connecting with servers for communication purposes, this behavior pattern in itself raises red flags that necessitate attention. Hence, the batch is classified as \"INTERESTING\" due to its potential implications of a security incident. The confidence level reflects the unusual nature of these activities but acknowledges that they could still be part of normal operations under specific conditions."}
