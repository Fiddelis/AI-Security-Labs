This activity in conjunction with SDXHelper.exe behavior might suggest an attempt to modify system configurations or evade detection.\n\n4. **User Profile Directory**:\n   - The fact that these activities are occurring within the user's profile directory increases the likelihood of unauthorized actions, as legitimate processes generally do not duplicate files or alter configurations silently within a userâ€™s download or application directories.\n\nThe combination of suspicious file duplication by SDXHelper.exe and unexpected configuration changes by winlogbeat.exe in non-standard locations makes this scenario noteworthy for further investigation. The confidence level is set at 0.85 due to the strong indicators of potential malicious behavior but recognizing that additional context (like benign software using these processes) could alter the interpretation."}
