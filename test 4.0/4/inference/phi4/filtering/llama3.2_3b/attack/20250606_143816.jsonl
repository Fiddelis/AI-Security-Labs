Multiple entries show the execution of commands via `powershell.exe` with a web client downloading and executing code from an external URL, which is a common tactic in script-based attacks. Additionally, sensitive file enumeration (sensitivefiles) suggests information gathering for further exploitation. The deletion of a temporary script file right after its creation may indicate an attempt to clean traces.
