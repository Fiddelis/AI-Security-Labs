The registry modifications by different processes (powershell.exe, cmd.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe) may indicate attempts to change system configurations or hide activities, raising suspicion. Additionally, the creation of files in user directories using winlogbeat.exe could suggest data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
