Here's an analysis of the provided logs:\n\n1. **PowerShell Process Creation**:\n   - The `process` field contains PowerShell commands used for creating and starting a Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\".\n   - The command in question uses `New-Service` to create a new service with a binary path pointing to `tarefa_logico.exe`.\n   - Immediately after, the service is started using `Start-Service`.\n\n2. **Winlog Entries**:\n   - The `winlog` field indicates two distinct tasks: \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\".\n   - \"Process Create\" suggests that this log entry is part of a rule set designed to track when new processes are initiated on the system.\n   - \"Provider Lifecycle\" may refer to lifecycle events related to event providers in Windows Event Logging, possibly indicating when certain logging functionalities or rules were initialized.\n\n3. **File Field**:\n   - The `file` field consistently shows \"None,\" implying no additional file-related data is logged with these entries.\n\n### Security Implications\n\n- **Potential Malicious Activity**: \n  - Creating and starting a service via PowerShell can be legitimate but may also indicate an attempt to establish persistence on the system. This could be part of an attacker's efforts to maintain access after initial compromise.\n  \n- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:\n  - The repeated use of the same PowerShell command in multiple logs might suggest automated behavior, such as a script running across different systems or at different times.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Investigate Origin**:\n   - Determine who initiated these PowerShell commands and whether they have legitimate authorization.\n   \n2. **Service Examination**:\n   - Check the properties and permissions of the \"objeto_ativo\" service and `tarefa_logico.exe` to ensure it is a trusted application.\n\n3. **Audit Logs**:\n   - Review other security logs around the same timeframe for additional signs of unauthorized activity or further indicators that might suggest malicious intent.\n\n4. **Security Tools**:\n   - Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools or SIEM solutions to correlate these events with other suspicious activities across your network.\n\n5. **Policy Review**:\n   - Reassess user permissions, especially regarding PowerShell execution policies and service creation, to ensure they align with organizational security policies.\n\n6. **Incident Response Plan**:\n   - If malicious activity is confirmed, follow the organization's incident response procedures to contain, eradicate, and recover from any potential threat.\n\nThese steps will help in understanding whether these activities are benign or part of a broader security issue."}
