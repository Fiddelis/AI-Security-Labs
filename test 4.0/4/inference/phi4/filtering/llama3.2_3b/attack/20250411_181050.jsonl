The use of 'certutil.exe' for encoding and decoding files, along with the execution of a decoded file as an executable ('File Executable Detected'), suggests data exfiltration or malware deployment attempts. Additionally, the repeated loading of images by 'SDXHelper.exe' into critical system DLLs such as 'combase.dll' and 'urlmon.dll' indicates potential DLL injection. The network connections initiated by 'chrome.exe', combined with multiple registry modifications, could signify an attempt to persist malicious changes or communicate with a command-and-control server.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
