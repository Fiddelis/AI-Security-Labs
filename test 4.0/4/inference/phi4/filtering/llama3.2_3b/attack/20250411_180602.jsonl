Notably, there are multiple instances of 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' being used in ways that modify file attributes (e.g., making files hidden) and create new files. The repeated creation of the same '.winlogbeat.yml.new' file by 'winlogbeat.exe' suggests potential tampering or misconfiguration. Additionally, 'chrome.exe' is involved in multiple registry modifications and loading system DLLs like 'amsi.dll', which could be indicative of bypassing anti-malware measures.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
