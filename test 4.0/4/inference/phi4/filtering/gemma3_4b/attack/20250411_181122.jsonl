{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing suspicious commands to search for files with sensitive keywords, combined with various other process and registry events indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```\n\n### Analysis Explanation:\n\n1. **Repeated Suspicious Commands:**\n   - Several entries show `powershell.exe` executing a command that searches for the keyword 'pass' in multiple file types (`*.xml`, `*.doc`, `*.txt`, `*.xls`). This is indicative of an attempt to locate sensitive information such as passwords.\n\n2. **Processes and Event Patterns:**\n   - The command uses tools like `findstr` within PowerShell, suggesting an effort to extract specific data from the system.\n   - Other processes (`svchost.exe`, `chrome.exe`) are involved in setting registry values, which can be a sign of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes aimed at maintaining unauthorized access.\n\n3. **File and Registry Activity:**\n   - The creation of files such as `.winlogbeat.yml.new` and modifications to PowerShell startup profiles could indicate attempts to modify logging settings or establish persistent backdoors.\n   - Frequent registry value changes by various processes (`notepad.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `chrome.exe`) are often associated with malware trying to hide its presence or alter system behavior.\n\n4. **Overall Suspicion:**\n   - The combination of searching for sensitive data, modifying startup and logging configurations, and multiple suspicious registry modifications across different processes suggests a coordinated effort potentially aimed at reconnaissance or data exfiltration.\n\nGiven these points, the batch is classified as \"INTERESTING\" due to the high likelihood of malicious intent. The confidence level of 0.9 reflects strong indicators of potential security incidents within the log entries."}
