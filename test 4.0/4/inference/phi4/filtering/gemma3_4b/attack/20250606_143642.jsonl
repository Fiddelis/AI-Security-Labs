{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the logs you've shared, several key activities related to PowerShell and various processes can be identified:\n\n1. **Process Creation:**\n   - Various processes such as `whoami.exe`, `services.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and instances of `svchost.exe` and `powershell.exe` were initiated.\n   - For example, `whoami.exe` was executed with the command line indicating its execution path.\n\n2. **Registry Activity:**\n   - There are entries where registry values have been set by processes like `services.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. These actions typically indicate configuration changes or updates within the system's registry.\n\n3. **File Operations:**\n   - A file was created in the temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`) by PowerShell, specifically a script named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`.\n   - Shortly after its creation, this file was deleted as logged under \"File Delete detected.\"\n\n4. **Image Loading:**\n   - Multiple assemblies and system files were loaded into memory when executing `powershell.exe`. These include:\n     - `taskschd.dll`\n     - Various .NET framework files like `mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, `clr.dll`\n     - Native images such as `mscorlib.ni.dll` and `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`\n     - Defender-related DLLs, indicating potential interaction with the system's antivirus solution.\n\n5. **Access and Execution:**\n   - PowerShell was accessed by itself several times, indicating internal operations or scripts running within its context.\n   - A command line execution of PowerShell involved removing items in a specific directory (`C:\\Windows\\temp`), suggesting cleanup activities might have been conducted, possibly as part of an attempt to remove traces or files related to an operation.\n\nOverall, these logs suggest typical system administrative tasks, but the presence of scripts and file manipulations by `powershell.exe` can also imply potential automated actions, which could be benign (e.g., maintenance) or malicious (e.g., cleanup following unauthorized activities). The context and intent behind these operations would require further investigation to determine if they pose any security concerns."}
