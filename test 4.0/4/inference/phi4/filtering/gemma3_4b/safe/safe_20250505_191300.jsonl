Frequent network connections might be indicative of unauthorized data transmission if they are not normal for the user's typical activity.\n  \n- **File Creation Time Changes**: There are several events indicating changes in file creation times under a 'Network' directory within Discord's roaming profile. This could suggest attempts at hiding or manipulating files, potentially related to command-and-control (C2) activities or data exfiltration.\n\n- **DLL Loading**: The loading of specific DLLs such as `vulkan-1.dll` and various other module-related nodes (`discord_desktop_overlay.node`, etc.) could be benign but are worth investigating for any unusual behavior or if they coincide with known malicious patterns or vulnerabilities in those libraries.\n  \n- **Registry Access**: One event indicates a registry value set by `Discord.exe`. Depending on what was changed, this might affect the system's configuration or stability and can be a vector for persistence mechanisms.\n\nGiven these activities combined, there is an elevated interest to investigate further. While many of these events could be typical behavior for Discord during normal operations (e.g., loading modules, establishing connections), their combination raises flags that warrant deeper scrutiny due to potential security implications. The confidence level reflects the balance between recognizing potentially benign activity and acknowledging patterns often associated with malicious actions."}
