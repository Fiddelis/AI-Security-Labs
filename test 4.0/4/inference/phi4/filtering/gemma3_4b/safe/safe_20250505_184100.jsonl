They include creating processes with specific command-line arguments, accessing the process, and loading images (DLLs). These are common operations required for Discord's functionality.\n\n- **Image Loading**: Various DLL files such as `ffmpeg.dll`, `d3dcompiler_47.dll`, `libGLESv2.dll`, `libEGL.dll`, `vulkan-1.dll`, and `vk_swiftshader.dll` are loaded. These are standard components associated with media processing and graphics rendering, which Discord uses for its features.\n\n- **Command-Line Arguments**: The arguments provided during process creation, such as `--type=gpu-process`, `--disable-features=AllowAggressiveThrottlingWithWebSocket`, etc., are typical for configuring the application's behavior and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n- **Consistency**: All events relate to a single user account (`fiddelis`) and follow a predictable pattern of legitimate application activity.\n\nGiven these observations, there is no evidence in the logs suggesting any abnormal or suspicious activity. The batch appears to be part of regular Discord operations."}
