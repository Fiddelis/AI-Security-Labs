PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it can also be leveraged by attackers to execute scripts or perform malicious actions. The series of events shows multiple image loads related to .NET and security components (e.g., mscoree.dll, clrjit.dll), which could suggest an attempt to exploit these libraries. Furthermore, the creation of a file via PowerShell in a temporary directory and the use of pipes are often techniques used in advanced persistent threats or malware execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
