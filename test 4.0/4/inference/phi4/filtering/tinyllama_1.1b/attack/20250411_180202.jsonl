The repeated use of 'powershell.exe' for both process access and file creation, along with registry modifications by 'RuntimeBroker.exe' and 'powershell.exe', raises suspicion. Additionally, the loading of system files like 'urlmon.dll', 'amsi.dll', and 'MpClient.dll' by 'WMIC.exe' is unusual, as these are typically not directly manipulated via WMIC.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
