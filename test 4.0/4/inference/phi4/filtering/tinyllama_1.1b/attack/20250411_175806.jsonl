Additionally, the presence of whoami.exe executed directly is unusual in normal operations and may indicate an attempt to gather user information illicitly. The registry event with cmd.exe suggests possible modification of system settings or persistence mechanisms. The repeated creation of a specific file by winlogbeat.exe could suggest tampering or unauthorized installation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
