Key indicators include the use of a process named 'whoami.exe' with an explicit command line invocation (often used by attackers to verify permissions), unauthorized user creation via 'net.exe', and multiple accesses of sensitive processes like 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe'. These activities, combined with changes in registry values and file creations that could be part of persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration attempts, warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
