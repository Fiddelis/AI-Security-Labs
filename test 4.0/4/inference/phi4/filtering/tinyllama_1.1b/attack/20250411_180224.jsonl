The use of schtasks.exe to query a task named 'win32times' is unusual and potentially malicious. PowerShell's involvement in file creation and process access events, especially when accessing sensitive files like 'whoami.exe', raises red flags. These activities collectively suggest potential unauthorized modifications or reconnaissance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
