The first thing I notice is that there's a 'whoami.exe' process running, which is normal as it's a built-in Windows tool. But then there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' being executed. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the PowerShell processes: it's using 'findstr' and 'select-string' to search for the word 'password' in various file types. That seems suspicious because it might be part of a password-gathering attempt. The command is searching through files like .xml, .doc, .txt, and .xls, which could be trying to find credentials stored in plain text.\n\nThen, there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET framework DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell, but the presence of multiple such entries might indicate that the process is loading more components than usual, possibly to execute scripts or payloads.\n\nAnother thing is the creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. This is a common tactic used by malware to execute scripts and then clean up traces. The file name '__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1' might be part of a script that was run, and then deleted to avoid detection.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events might be related to the PowerShell execution policy or other security features being bypassed. However, without more context, it's a bit hard to tell, but combined with the other events, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nThere's also a 'Pipe Created' event, which could be used for inter-process communication. While not inherently malicious, in this context, it might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of searching for passwords in files, loading multiple DLLs, creating and deleting temporary files, and multiple PowerShell events could indicate an attempt to gather sensitive information or execute a script. However, it's not definitive proof of malicious intent. But given the patterns observed, it's worth investigating further to rule out any potential security threats.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to search for passwords in files, combined with temporary script file creation\/deletion and loading of .NET DLLs, suggests potential credential harvesting or malicious script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: there's a PowerShell command using findstr and select-string to search for 'password' in various file types. That seems like a potential information disclosure or data exfiltration attempt. The command is looking for passwords in files, which could be part of a malicious activity.\n\nNext, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal, but I should check if there's anything unusual about the path or the file name. The path seems standard, so maybe not a red flag here.\n\nThen, notepad.exe setting a registry value. Notepad is a common tool, but changing registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The same goes for svchost.exe and other processes modifying registry values. These are common system processes, so maybe legitimate.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events again. Multiple instances of PowerShell executing the same command to find passwords in files. That's concerning because it's repeated, and searching for passwords in sensitive files could indicate an attacker trying to gather credentials. Also, the use of -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue might be to avoid logging errors, which is a tactic used by malware to remain stealthy.\n\nAnother event shows findstr.exe being executed with the same command line. Findstr is a standard Windows utility, but when used in combination with PowerShell in this way, it might be part of a script that's scanning the system for sensitive information.\n\nThere are also events related to image loaded, like urlmon.dll and MpClient.dll. These are legitimate system files, so loading them isn't necessarily bad. However, if an attacker is injecting code into these processes, it could be a problem. But the events here just mention the image being loaded, not any unusual behavior.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell processes accessing files and the registry, along with the repeated command lines, suggests that someone is actively searching through the system for sensitive data. This is a classic sign of a data exfiltration attempt or reconnaissance phase of an attack.\n\nI should also check for any anomalies in the file paths. The winlogbeat file is in the Downloads directory, which is normal for installing software. The other files mentioned are system paths, which are expected.\n\nConsidering all these points, the repeated PowerShell commands searching for passwords, combined with the use of techniques to suppress errors, indicate a potential security threat. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination here is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to search for 'password' in files (e.g., *.xml, *.doc) across the system, which is a common technique used in data exfiltration or reconnaissance.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look at all the events together, not individually.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to chrome.exe. There are a bunch of registry value set events and DNS queries. But then there's one event where winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a bit unusual because winlogbeat is typically used for log collection, so creating a file there might be normal, but maybe not if it's unexpected. However, the path seems like a standard installation path, so maybe that's okay.\n\nThen, there are some image loaded events. Chrome loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. So, chrome.exe loading these files might be normal if it's being scanned. But why is that logged here? Maybe it's part of a security feature, but I need to check if this is typical. However, if these are being loaded from unexpected paths, that could be a red flag. But the paths here are standard system directories, so maybe that's normal.\n\nThen there's a network connection detected event from chrome.exe. That's common for a browser, so probably not suspicious. Also, the DNS queries from chrome.exe are normal for browsing. But the fact that there are multiple DNS queries might not be an issue unless they're going to malicious domains. However, the logs don't show the domains, so I can't tell that here.\n\nAnother thing is the powershell.exe event where it created a file called objeto_logico.txt. That's a user-created file in the Downloads folder. Unless there's something suspicious about the file's content or the command used to create it, just creating a text file doesn't seem malicious. But since the user is asking about the batch, maybe the combination of events is suspicious. However, the majority of events are from chrome.exe doing normal activities, and the others are either normal or not clearly malicious.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if the batch is interesting for investigation. The only potentially suspicious thing here is the winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. But that's part of its normal operation when setting up. Unless there's an unusual number of such events or other signs, but in this case, there's only one. The rest are chrome-related activities which are common. So, maybe the classification is not interesting because there's no clear malicious activity. But wait, the justification needs to be concise. Maybe the presence of multiple registry changes and network connections from chrome could be a red flag, but without more context, like the specific registry keys or network destinations, it's hard to say. In the absence of such details, the events might not be enough to classify as interesting. So, the confidence would be low, but the classification is not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events primarily involve normal chrome.exe operations (registry changes, DNS queries, network connections) and benign file creation by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a common tool, maybe part of a log setup. Not immediately suspicious, but maybe if it's creating config files, but the path seems standard.\n\nNext, powershell.exe created a file called estrutura_ativo.txt. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but creating a text file isn't necessarily bad. However, the name is a bit generic, but not a red flag yet.\n\nThen there's an entry with process None and task None. That might be a placeholder or an error in logging, but not sure yet. Maybe not significant.\n\nThe same winlogbeat.exe entry repeats. Maybe a duplicate log entry, but not sure if that's an issue. Could be a normal event.\n\nThen, powershell.exe accessing processes and registry changes. Multiple entries of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. PowerShell is often used in attacks, so that's a point to note. But need to see if there's a pattern.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe entries: there's a command line that uses schtasks to delete scheduled tasks. The command line is a bit long. Deleting scheduled tasks could be part of cleanup after an attack, or maybe legitimate if the user is managing tasks. But combined with other events, maybe suspicious.\n\nAnother entry with schtasks.exe deleting tasks. That's part of the same command line as before. The use of schtasks to delete tasks might indicate someone trying to remove traces of their activities.\n\nThen, svchost.exe and conhost.exe interacting with the registry. svchost is a normal system process, but registry changes could be part of configuration or malware. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nMultiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and changing registry values. This repetition might indicate ongoing activity, which could be benign (like a script running) or malicious (like persistence mechanisms).\n\nThe user mentioned \"winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\" which is a legitimate tool for log shipping, but creating a .yml.new file might be part of its normal operation. However, if that's the only activity, it's not suspicious. But combined with other events, it's more complex.\n\nThe key points here are the multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe activities, especially the deletion of scheduled tasks. Scheduled tasks are often used by attackers to maintain persistence. Deleting them could be an attempt to remove evidence. Also, the registry changes might be related to setting up persistence or modifying system behavior.\n\nHowever, without seeing the actual content of the files created or the details of the registry changes, it's a bit hard to be certain. But the combination of these events—multiple process accesses, registry modifications, and task deletions—raises a red flag. It's possible that this is a legitimate activity, but the frequency and types of events make it more likely to be something worth investigating.\n\nSo, the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7. The justification is the combination of PowerShell activities, registry changes, and scheduled task deletions which are common in malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe activities, including registry modifications and scheduled task deletions, which are commonly associated with malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or cleanup efforts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}

The first thing I notice is that there are multiple instances of processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe being created or accessed. The command lines for some of these processes are interesting. For example, there's a cmd.exe command that uses wmic to delete processes named notepad.exe. That seems suspicious because using wmic to delete processes isn't typical behavior.\n\nThen there's a WMIC.exe process that's loading DLLs from system directories, like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. While those are legitimate system files, the fact that they're being loaded by WMIC could indicate something's wrong. Also, there's a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which might be a red flag if it's being accessed in an unusual way.\n\nLooking further, there are several commands to delete users using net user \/del. Deleting user accounts is a significant action, and if it's done by a process that's not supposed to be doing that, it could be a sign of a malicious actor trying to remove traces or take control.\n\nAlso, the repeated use of Registry value set events with processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe might indicate attempts to modify system settings or disable security features. The presence of both ProcessCreate and ProcessAccess events could suggest that the attacker is trying to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.\n\nHowever, I need to check if all these events are part of normal operations. For example, whoami.exe is a legitimate tool, but if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, that adds to the concern. The combination of deleting processes, modifying the registry, and deleting user accounts seems like a pattern that's often seen in malicious activities, such as lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nOn the other hand, some of these events could be part of a legitimate script or system maintenance, but the frequency and the specific commands used (like deleting notepad.exe processes and user accounts) are more indicative of a potential security incident.

But then there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' being accessed and creating processes. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's a 'cmd.exe' process with a command line that deletes temporary files. The command line includes deleting files from the Temp directory. That might be part of cleaning up after some activity, which is suspicious. Also, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events, which could indicate changes to the system's configuration, maybe to persist access or modify settings.\n\nThen, there's a 'File Delete logged' event where a specific executable is deleted from the Temp folder. Deleting files, especially after running some processes, might be an attempt to remove evidence. \n\nAnother thing is the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with PowerShell.

That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the specific events. \n\nThere are several \"Image loaded\" events for system files like mscorlib.ni.dll and clrjit.dll. Those are part of the .NET framework, so maybe legitimate. But then there's a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a security-related file, so loading that might be normal too. However, if there's unexpected behavior here, it could be a red flag.\n\nNext, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. The creation and deletion could be part of a script testing, but sometimes attackers create and delete files to avoid leaving traces. The name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be part of a legitimate test, but combined with other events, it's worth noting.\n\nThere's also a pipe created event, which might be normal, but if it's part of a communication channel, that could be suspicious. The \"Process accessed\" events are common, but multiple accesses might indicate something. \n\nThen there are multiple instances of whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user info, but if done excessively, it might be part of reconnaissance. However, the logs show it's being run normally, so maybe not malicious.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory is related to log collection, so that's likely legitimate. \n\nPutting this all together: The majority of events seem legitimate, like normal PowerShell operations and system processes. However, the combination of file creation and deletion in Temp, along with multiple process accesses and image loads, might indicate some testing or script execution. But without more context, like unusual commands or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say if it's malicious. The justification is that while some events are normal, the pattern of actions could be part of a benign test or a potential attack.

So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'whoami.exe' being created. The 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate Windows tool that displays the current user's identity, so that's normal. But 'powershell.exe' is used a lot for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. However, just seeing PowerShell being accessed might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen I notice some events related to 'Image loaded' with 'urlmon.dll'. The path is 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll', which is a legitimate system file. But I should check if there's any unusual activity here. The 'ImageLoad' events could indicate that a process is loading a DLL, which is normal, but if it's from an unexpected location or by an unexpected process, that's a red flag. However, in this case, the path is correct, so maybe that's not an issue.\n\nThere's also a 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and forwarding logs, so that's probably just part of normal operations. However, the filename has a '.new' extension, which might be part of the normal process of writing configuration files. Not sure if that's significant yet.\n\nLooking at the registry events, several processes like 'svchost.exe', 'RuntimeBroker.exe', and others are setting registry values. Registry changes can be part of normal operations, but if there are multiple changes from different processes, it might indicate some configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nThe 'chrome.exe' entries show DNS queries and network connections. Multiple DNS queries and network connections from Chrome are normal if the user is browsing the web. Unless there are connections to suspicious domains, which aren't mentioned here, this might just be regular browsing activity.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The main points are:\n\n1. Repeated 'powershell.exe' access events. While PowerShell is common, if there's a lot of activity, it might be worth checking for malicious scripts. However, without seeing the actual commands or unusual parameters, it's hard to say.\n\n2. The 'whoami.exe' commands are normal and not suspicious.\n\n3. The 'ImageLoad' events for 'urlmon.dll' are legitimate.\n\n4. The 'winlogbeat.exe' activity seems normal.\n\n5. Registry changes are part of normal operations.\n\nBut wait, looking again, there's a mix of normal system processes and some that might be benign. However, the repetition of 'Process accessed' for PowerShell could be a sign of something. Maybe someone is running multiple PowerShell sessions, but that's not necessarily malicious. Also, the presence of 'calc.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll'—calc.exe is a legitimate calculator, so that's normal.\n\nHmm, I don't see any obvious signs of a security incident here. The events seem to be part of regular system operations. Unless there's something I'm missing, like unusual command-line arguments in PowerShell or unexpected network destinations, but the logs don't show that. The 'whoami' commands are just checking the user, which is normal.\n\nSo, considering all this, the batch doesn't show any malicious activity. The events are typical for a system in use. Therefore, the classification should be 'NOT INTERESTING' with moderate confidence, since while there's a lot of activity, nothing stands out as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show routine system activity with no clear indicators of compromise.
