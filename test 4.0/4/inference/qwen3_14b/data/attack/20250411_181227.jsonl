{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are multiple entries with powershell.exe executing commands. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to run calc.exe, which is a bit suspicious. The triggers are set to AtLogon, and the principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest. That means the task is running with admin privileges, which is a red flag. Also, the tasks are named things like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. These names don't seem to be standard, which could indicate they're created by an attacker.\n\nThere are several entries of the same command being executed multiple times, which might be an attempt to create multiple scheduled tasks. The use of PowerShell to create scheduled tasks with admin rights is a common technique in attacks to maintain persistence. Also, the fact that the same command is repeated multiple times could be an indicator of automated script execution, which is often used in malware.\n\nOther events include registry value sets and process accesses, but the key part here is the scheduled task creation. The presence of multiple scheduled tasks being registered with admin privileges and using calc.exe (which is a known test program but can be a payload in attacks) suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence here is high because creating multiple scheduled tasks with elevated privileges is a strong indicator of compromise. However, I should check if there's any benign explanation, but in most cases, this would be flagged as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges to execute calc.exe at user logon, which is a common technique for persistence in malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I see several entries related to PowerShell.exe. The first few events mention Image loaded for .NET Framework DLLs like clr.dll and clrjit.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so maybe normal operations. But then there's an entry where PowerShell creates a file in the Temp directory, then deletes it. That could be suspicious because creating and deleting a temporary file might be part of an attack, like executing a script and then cleaning up.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command line that's pretty complex. It's using ScheduledTask to run calc.exe with high privileges, targeting Administrators. That seems like a clear indicator of malicious activity. The command is using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask, which are PowerShell cmdlets that can be abused for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThen, there are multiple events from Chrome.exe with Registry value set. But Chrome modifying the registry isn't necessarily bad, though repeated changes might be a red flag. However, the majority of the suspicious stuff is from PowerShell.\n\nAlso, there are several events with \"Execute a Remote Command\" but the process is None. That might be a log error or an incomplete entry, but it's not clear. However, the PowerShell events are more concrete.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell events, especially the command to create a scheduled task with elevated privileges, are significant. Even though some files are legitimate, the combination of creating a temp file, deleting it, and the scheduled task command suggests an attempt to exploit the system. The Chrome events might be benign, but the PowerShell activities are concerning. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events show suspicious behavior: creating and deleting a temporary script file, loading legitimate .NET DLLs (which could be part of a malicious payload), and attempting to register a scheduled task with high privileges to execute calc.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' with process and file as None. That's a bit odd because usually, if a remote command is executed, there should be some process information. But maybe those are just placeholders or errors in the log.\n\nThen there's an entry with a PowerShell command that's creating a scheduled task. The command_line shows something like New-ScheduledTaskAction with calc.exe, which is a common trick used in attacks to execute malicious code. The user is set to Administrators with high privileges, which is a red flag. That's definitely suspicious because creating a scheduled task with admin rights could be part of a privilege escalation or persistence mechanism.\n\nNext, there's a WmiPrvSE.exe process loading taskschd.dll. WmiPrvSE is the Windows Management Instrumentation Provider Service, and taskschd.dll is related to Task Scheduler. While that's normal, if it's loading from an unusual path or in an unexpected context, it could be malicious. However, the path here is the standard System32 location, so maybe that's okay. But combined with other events, it might be part of something larger.\n\nThen there are multiple svchost.exe processes setting registry values. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and changing registry values could be part of configuration changes, but if done in a way that's not typical, it might indicate tampering. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The same goes for the file creation events under Tasks\\\\unidade_comum. The name 'unidade_comum' might be a red herring, but creating a scheduled task in that directory could be part of an attack.\n\nThe PowerShell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory is somewhat normal, as that's a common place for temporary files. However, the presence of other suspicious events might make this more concerning. Also, the registry events related to Chrome and other processes might be benign, but if they're modifying critical keys, that's a problem.\n\nAnother thing to note is the winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation, but if it's in a user's Downloads directory, it could be a sign that someone is trying to install or configure it improperly.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious event is the PowerShell command creating a scheduled task with admin privileges. That's a clear indicator of potential malicious activity. The other events might be part of the same attack or just noise. However, since there's a concrete action that's highly suspicious, this batch should be flagged as interesting. The confidence is high because the scheduled task creation with elevated privileges is a strong indicator of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events combined with a PowerShell process creating a scheduled task with Administrator privileges and a suspicious file path ('C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\Tasks\\\\unidade_comum') suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at each entry.\n\nFirst, there are eight entries where the process is chrome.exe and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much, but maybe it's normal for some settings. However, repeated registry changes could be suspicious, especially if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen there's one entry with winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. The path is in the Downloads folder, which isn't too unusual, but I should note that.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe entry creating a file called \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\". PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but creating files can sometimes be part of malicious activity. The filename is in Spanish, which might be a red flag if it's related to something suspicious, but not necessarily. However, combined with other events, it might indicate something.\n\nNow, looking at the combination. Chrome modifying the registry multiple times could be part of a persistence mechanism. If an attacker is using Chrome to set registry values that help maintain access, that's a concern. The presence of PowerShell creating a file might be part of initial access or data exfiltration. The winlogbeat file creation is probably legitimate, but the other events might be more concerning.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful. Are these events part of normal user activity? For example, Chrome might update settings, and PowerShell might be used for scripting. But if there's a pattern of multiple registry changes and file creations, especially in unusual locations or with unusual names, that's more suspicious.\n\nThe justification should mention the repeated registry modifications by Chrome and the PowerShell file creation. The confidence might be around 0.6 because while there are some suspicious elements, they could be legitimate. But the combination might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe registry modification events combined with PowerShell file creation in user downloads directory suggest potential malicious activity or anomalous behavior warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
