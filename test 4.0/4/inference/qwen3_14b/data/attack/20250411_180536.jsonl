{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple DNS queries and network connections from chrome.exe. Chrome usually does a lot of network activity, so that might be normal. But then there's a line where the process is None and the task is None. That's odd. Maybe some incomplete logs, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user info, but if it's part of a larger attack, it could be a red flag. But alone, it's not suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a long command line. The command uses sc.exe to create a service and start it. The paths mentioned are C:\\elemento_geral\\componente_comum\\modulo_geral\\bin\\unidade_base.exe. That looks like a custom or non-standard path. sc.exe is used to manage services, so creating a new service might be normal, but if it's done by an unexpected process, it could be malicious. Also, the command line is a bit complex with multiple sc.exe commands, which might indicate someone is trying to set up persistence.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is common, but if it's being used for process access or registry changes, that could be part of an attack. The registry value set events might be an attempt to modify system settings or inject code.\n\nThe services.exe entries show registry value sets. Services.exe is a system process, but if it's modifying its own registry keys, that could be normal. However, if there's unexpected activity, it might be a sign of compromise.\n\nThe sc.exe process creating a service named 'tarefa_principal' with a path to another non-standard executable. That's a red flag. Also, the 'elemento_auxiliar' service start command might be part of establishing persistence.\n\nThen there are image load events for mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, and clr.dll. These are .NET runtime components. If they're being loaded from unexpected locations or in unusual contexts, that could be a problem. However, the paths here are standard Windows directories, so maybe that's okay. But the presence of these image loads in conjunction with other suspicious activities might be significant.\n\nPutting it all together: there's a mix of normal activities (chrome, whoami, powershell) but also some suspicious actions like creating new services with non-standard paths, multiple registry modifications, and image loads that might be part of a larger attack. The use of sc.exe and the creation of services could be an attempt to maintain persistence on the system. The combination of these events, especially the service creation and registry changes, makes this batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence is medium because while some activities are normal, the combination of service creation, registry events, and non-standard paths suggests potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of non-standard services (e.g., 'elemento_principal', 'tarefa_principal'), registry modifications by services.exe, and execution of sc.exe\/cmd.exe with complex commands to install and start services. These patterns suggest potential persistence mechanisms or unauthorized system modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's tarefa_logico.exe, estrutura_principal.exe, modulo_secundario.exe, and elemento_ativo.exe. These names don't ring any bells as standard Windows processes. They sound more like custom or possibly malicious names. Then there's cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and svchost.exe, which are common, but when combined with other activities, they might be part of something suspicious.\n\nNow, the events: most of them are \"Registry value set\" and \"Image loaded\". The registry events are common in normal operations, but when multiple processes are changing registry values, it could indicate configuration changes by malware. The ImageLoad events are about loading DLLs. The paths mentioned like mscorlib.ni.dll and clrjit.dll are part of the .NET framework, which is normal. However, the other processes like tarefa_logico.exe loading from a non-standard path might be a red flag.\n\nWait, looking at the file paths for the ImageLoad events: the first one is in C:\\Windows\\assembly... which is part of the .NET framework, so that's okay. The calc.exe and Calculator.exe are loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL for Internet Explorer, so that's normal. But the other processes with those weird namesâ€”maybe they're part of a larger attack. \n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file is normal during setup. But why is it happening twice? Maybe a normal installation, but not necessarily suspicious.\n\nHowever, the combination of multiple custom processes, registry changes, and the presence of processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe could indicate someone is trying to execute scripts or make changes. But without more context, like unusual commands or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say. \n\nThe key here is that all events seem to be part of normal operations except for the non-standard process names. But since there's no clear malicious activity like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or known malicious payloads, it might not be interesting. However, the presence of multiple custom processes and registry changes might warrant further investigation. \n\nHmm, but the confidence here is a bit low. The justification would be that while some events are normal, the combination of custom processes and registry changes could be indicative of something. But without more evidence, it's not conclusive. So maybe classify as INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple non-standard processes (e.g., 'tarefa_logico.exe', 'modulo_secundario.exe') are observed with registry modification and image load events.
