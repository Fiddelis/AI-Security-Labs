The user is asking if the batch is relevant for investigation. Let me go through each line.\n\nFirst, there are several entries about powershell.exe with different tasks. The first one is Process accessed, then a Process Create with whoami.exe. Then more Process accessed and Registry value set. Then a Process Create with a long command line that includes importing a module from a path that looks suspicious. The path has '..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1' which might be a directory traversal or something. The command line also has Invoke-entrada_principal which might be a custom command. Then there are multiple Image Load events for various DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender. Then a File created and deleted in the Temp directory, which could be normal, but the creation and deletion quickly might be suspicious. Then a Pipe Created event. Then more Image Loads. Finally, svchost.exe creating a file in SoftwareDistribution, which is normal for updates, and a Registry event.\n\nSo, the key points here are the PowerShell activities. The command line in one of the Process Create events has a suspicious path and a custom command. The repeated access to PowerShell, loading of various DLLs, and the file creation\/deletion in Temp might indicate some malicious activity. However, some of these could be normal, like the .NET DLLs and Windows Defender components. But the presence of a custom script being loaded and executed, especially with a path that seems to be navigating directories, could be a sign of something malicious. The fact that the script is being run and then deleted might be an attempt to hide it. Also, the use of PowerShell for executing scripts is common in attacks. However, without more context, like the actual content of the script or other indicators, it's a bit tricky.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, and svchost.exe are all setting registry values. That's a common activity, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's sppsvc.exe creating a file in the Windows System32\\spp\\store\\2.0\\cache directory. The file is cache.dat, which might be normal for software protection service. But then there's a powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData folder. That's a bit more suspicious because PowerShell is often used for scripting, and creating files in startup profiles could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further, multiple svchost.exe entries are creating files in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory. The Metadata folder here is part of Windows Update, so those files like UpdateAgent.dll, dpx.dll, etc., might be part of a legitimate update process. But svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, and if it's creating a lot of files here, maybe it's related to a legitimate update. However, I should check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nThen there are entries where svchost.exe and backgroundTaskHost.exe load urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll. These are legitimate DLLs used for web browsing and background transfers, so that's normal. But the repetition of svchost.exe creating multiple files in the same directory might be a red flag if it's part of an attack. However, considering the paths and the files, they seem to be related to Windows Update components.\n\nNow, the HxTsr.exe is a process that I'm not immediately familiar with. Maybe it's a legitimate process, but I should check. A quick search in my mindâ€”HxTsr.exe isn't a standard Windows process. It might be associated with some third-party software or malware. If that's the case, then that's a point in favor of being interesting.\n\nThe presence of PowerShell creating a file in the StartupProfileData could indicate someone trying to set up persistence. Also, the combination of registry changes and file creations by svchost.exe, which is a trusted process, might be normal, but if there's an unusual number of files or unexpected paths, that's a concern. However, in this case, the paths are standard for Windows updates.\n\nPutting it all together: HxTsr.exe is a suspicious process name. The PowerShell activity could be benign, but combined with the unknown process, it raises flags. The svchost.exe activities seem to be part of normal system operations, but the presence of HxTsr.exe and the PowerShell file creation might indicate something worth investigating. So, the classification here is probably \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.65. The justification is the presence of HxTsr.exe and the PowerShell file creation in the startup directory, which could be signs of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** INTERESTING  \n**Confidence:** 0.65  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n1. **Suspicious Process Name (HxTsr.exe):** This is not a standard Windows process. While it could be a legitimate third-party application, its presence in the event log raises initial concerns.  \n2. **PowerShell Activity:** The creation of a file in the user's AppData directory (`StartupProfileData`) by `powershell.exe` is notable. Such activity could indicate attempts to establish persistence or execute scripts, though further analysis is needed to confirm malicious intent.  \n3. **svchost.exe File Creations:** Multiple `svchost.exe` entries creating files in the `SoftwareDistribution\\Download` directory (e.g., `UpdateAgent.dll`, `TurboStack.dll`) appear to align with Windows Update operations. However, the volume and repetition of these events could warrant scrutiny if unrelated to a known update.  \n4. **Legitimate DLL Loads:** The loading of `urlmon.dll` and `BitsProxy.dll` by trusted processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `backgroundTaskHost.exe`) is consistent with normal system behavior.  \n\n**Conclusion:** While some activities (e.g., svchost.exe file creation) align with legitimate system operations, the presence of an uncommon process (`HxTsr.exe`) and PowerShell-related file creation in a user-specific directory merit further investigation to rule out potential malicious activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are from svchost.exe, which is a common Windows process that hosts various system services. The main tasks mentioned are \"Registry value set\" and \"File created\". There are a few instances where files are created in specific directories like C:\\Windows\\Logs\\waasmedic, C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\DataStore\\Logs, and others. \n\nNow, svchost.exe is normal, but when it's creating files in certain locations, especially those related to Windows Update or system logs, that might be suspicious. For example, the file paths like \"waasmedic.20250606_143612_048.etl\" and \"edbtmp.log\" are associated with Windows Update and the Software Distribution service. However, the presence of multiple file creations and registry modifications could indicate something unusual. \n\nWait, but some of these files are part of normal system operations. For instance, the SoftwareDistribution folder is used by Windows Update, and the logs there are typical. However, the repeated \"Registry value set\" events might be a red flag. If there are a lot of registry changes from svchost.exe, that could be indicative of malicious activity, like a worm or a backdoor modifying registry keys to persist or change system behavior.\n\nBut I also need to check if there's any anomalous behavior. The fact that most events are from svchost.exe, which is a legitimate process, but combined with multiple file creations in system directories and registry changes, it might be worth investigating. However, since there's no mention of any unusual processes, unexpected network activity, or other signs of compromise, it's possible that these are just normal system updates or maintenance tasks.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the events are in JSONL format, and I need to consider the entire batch. Let me count the events. There are multiple entries, but most are either Registry value sets or File created events. The files created are in system directories, which is normal for some processes. However, the high frequency of Registry value set events might be abnormal. Typically, svchost.exe might modify the registry as part of its services, but if it's doing it excessively, that could be a problem.\n\nAnother point is that one of the events has the process as \"None\", which might indicate a lack of process information. That could be a sign of something trying to hide its origin, but I need to check if that's a common occurrence. However, in some cases, the event might not have process information due to logging limitations, so maybe not a big red flag here.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of multiple registry changes and file creations by svchost.exe could be normal if it's part of a system update or service operation. However, the lack of other suspicious activities (like network connections, unexpected processes, etc.) makes me think that this might not be a security incident. But the high number of Registry value set events might still be worth looking into, even if it's not a high-confidence alert. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is that it's not particularly suspicious, but the high frequency of registry events could be a point for further investigation. However, since the user wants to know if it's interesting for investigation, I should consider if there are enough indicators to warrant looking deeper. Without more context, like the time frame or other logs, it's a bit tricky. But based solely on these events, I think it's more on the side of normal system activity rather than a clear security threat. So, maybe the classification is \"not interesting\" but with some caution.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** Not Interesting (Likely Normal System Activity)  \n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe events primarily involve **svchost.exe**, a legitimate Windows system process responsible for hosting various services. The majority of logs are:  \n- **Registry value set** (normal for system services managing configurations).  \n- **File creation** in system directories (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\Logs\\waasmedic`, `C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\DataStore\\Logs`), which are typical for Windows Update and system maintenance tasks.  \n\n**Key Observations:**  \n1. **svchost.exe Activity**: While svchost.exe can be exploited in attacks, its presence here aligns with standard operations (e.g., Windows Update logging, registry updates for system services).  \n2. **File Paths**: The created files (e.g., `.etl` logs, `edbtmp.log`) are associated with legitimate system processes, not malicious behavior.  \n3. **No Red Flags**: No evidence of suspicious network activity, unexpected processes, or anomalies in user behavior. The single event with `process: None` is likely a logging limitation, not a security concern.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe logs reflect **normal system activity** (e.g., Windows Update operations, registry updates for system services). While the high frequency of registry modifications might warrant further scrutiny in isolation, **no clear indicators of compromise** are present in this dataset. No immediate investigation is required.  \n\n**Confidence Level:** Medium (Activity is normal, but isolated registry changes could be benign or require context)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: svchost.exe, MpSigStub.exe, setup.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and powershell.exe. Svchost is a common system process, so that's normal. MpSigStub is related to Windows Defender, which is also legitimate. Setup.exe could be part of an installer, maybe for EdgeCore. RuntimeBroker and PowerShell are also normal, but sometimes PowerShell can be used maliciously.\n\nNow, the events: several file creations. The first few are under SoftwareDistribution, which is part of Windows Update. The files like AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe might be part of an update. Then there are files in the Temp directory with names like mpasdlta.vdm and mpavdlta.vdm. Those look like they could be part of Defender's definition updates. The setup.exe is creating files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory, which might be part of a legitimate Edge installation or update.\n\nBut wait, the presence of multiple file creations in Temp and under SoftwareDistribution might be normal during updates. However, the combination of MpSigStub.exe creating those VDM files and setup.exe creating Edge-related executables could indicate an update process. However, I need to check if there's anything suspicious. The file paths seem legitimate. There's no mention of unexpected processes or unusual activity. The PowerShell event is just a process access, which isn't necessarily bad. The Registry value sets are from svchost and RuntimeBroker, which are normal for system operations.\n\nHmm, but maybe the high number of file creations and the specific names of the files could be part of a legitimate update. However, sometimes attackers use similar names for malicious files. But without more context, like the files being signed, or other indicators of compromise, it's hard to say. The presence of MpSigStub and MsMpEng, which are part of Windows Defender, suggests that these events are related to security software updating, which is normal.\n\nSo, considering all that, the events seem to be part of regular system and software updates. Unless there's additional context indicating otherwise, like the files not being signed or unexpected network activity, this might not be suspicious. However, the user might want to check if these updates are expected. But based solely on the given events, they appear legitimate. Therefore, maybe this isn't interesting for investigation unless there's a known issue with those specific files or processes.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event log entries appear to represent **normal system and software update activities**, primarily related to **Windows Defender definition updates** and **Microsoft Edge installation\/update processes**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Processes and Activities:**\n   - **`svchost.exe`** and **`MpSigStub.exe`** are standard Windows processes associated with **Windows Defender** and **definition updates**. The creation of `.vdm` files (e.g., `mpasdlta.vdm`, `mpavdlta.vdm`) in the `Temp` directory aligns with **Windows Defender's update mechanism**.\n   - **`setup.exe`** creating files in the **Microsoft EdgeCore** directory (e.g., `ie_to_edge_stub.exe`, `cookie_exporter.exe`) suggests a **legitimate Edge installation\/update**.\n   - **`MsMpEng.exe`** (Windows Defender's main process) loading `mpengine.dll` is a standard operation during updates.\n\n2. **No Clear Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - File paths and process names are consistent with **expected system behavior** (e.g., `SoftwareDistribution` for Windows Update, `Temp` for temporary files).\n   - No suspicious network activity, unusual registry modifications, or anomalous process behavior (e.g., lateral movement, credential access) is indicated.\n\n3. **Potential Edge Cases:**\n   - While **`powershell.exe`** and **`RuntimeBroker.exe`** are legitimate, their presence alone is not suspicious. However, **PowerShell** could be exploited in attacks if used for malicious scripting (not indicated here).\n   - The high number of file creations might be **normal during an update** but could warrant further scrutiny if **unrelated to known scheduled tasks** or **unexpected by the user**.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis log does **not show clear signs of malicious activity**. The events align with **standard system updates** and **legitimate software installations**. However, if these activities are **unexpected** or **occur outside of known update windows**, further investigation (e.g., checking file hashes, verifying digital signatures, reviewing network traffic) is recommended to rule out **sophisticated attacks masquerading as updates**.\n\n**Final Verdict:** **Not Interesting for Investigation** (based on provided data)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. That's common, but when combined with certain actions, it can be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the fourth event, there's a command line that uses New-Service to create a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". That's suspicious because creating a new service with a custom executable isn't typical for normal operations. The path mentioned is in a directory that seems to be a temporary or user-specific location, which might indicate an attempted installation of a backdoor or malicious service.\n\nThen, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell, which is normal, but the presence of .NET framework DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll is expected. However, the loading of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender's directory is odd. Those are legitimate files, but their loading in this context might be part of a bypass technique, like trying to impersonate a trusted process. \n\nThere's also a File Create and subsequent File Delete event for a temporary script file. This could be an attempt to execute a script and then clean up traces, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection. \n\nThe repeated Registry value set events for services.exe might indicate attempts to modify service configurations, possibly to persist the malicious activity. \n\nPutting this all together, the combination of creating a new service with a suspicious executable, loading unusual DLLs, and manipulating files and registry entries points towards potential malicious behavior. The use of PowerShell for these actions, along with the cleanup of temporary files, suggests an attack that's trying to remain stealthy. \n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these events could be benign. For example, PowerShell is widely used, and Windows Defender components are legitimate. But the specific combination here, especially the service creation and the file operations, raises enough suspicion to warrant further investigation. \n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say around 0.8 because while there are some legitimate elements, the overall pattern is indicative of a potential security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include creating a new service with a suspicious executable path (tarefa_logico.exe), loading unusual DLLs (MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll), and temporary file creation\/deletion, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first few entries show the process 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading various DLLs from the Windows System32 and .NET Framework directories. Those are legitimate paths, so maybe that's normal.

That seems odd because executing remote commands can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if the script is being run from a non-standard location. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of the same PowerShell command line that imports a module from that same script path. The command includes 'Invoke-entrada_principal' which might be a custom function, and it's outputting to the Temp directory. The repeated calls to Start-Sleep and error handling could be part of a script that's trying to be stealthy. \n\nAlso, the 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks might indicate that some PowerShell provider or engine is being manipulated, which could be part of an attack. The fact that the same command is repeated multiple times might suggest that the script is being executed in a loop or multiple times, which isn't typical in normal operations.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of loading legitimate DLLs, followed by PowerShell executing a remote command from a non-standard path, and the repeated execution of a script that's importing modules and handling errors, points towards potential malicious activity.

The fact that this is done repeatedly, and the service is started immediately, could be suspicious. Creating a service is a common technique used by malware to persist on a system.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a log event. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. Most of them have the same structure. The process is often \"None\", and the winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". The file path is consistently \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". There are a few other tasks like \"Logon\", \"Special Logon\", and \"Security Group Management\", but those don't seem to be the main focus here.\n\nNow, the key thing here is the repetition. There are 24 entries, and almost all of them are the same: executing a remote command with the same PowerShell script. Even though the process is listed as \"None\" in some cases, the fact that the same file is being executed repeatedly multiple times is suspicious. \n\nIn cybersecurity, repeated execution of the same script, especially a .ps1 file (which is PowerShell), could indicate an attempt to run malicious code. The fact that it's happening so many times might be a sign of either a persistent attack or a failed attempt that's being retried. The other events with different tasks might be normal logon activities, but the repeated remote command executions stand out.\n\nHowever, I should consider if this could be a false positive. Maybe it's a legitimate script that's being run multiple times as part of a normal process. But given that the file path is in a directory named \"registro_secundario\" (which might translate to secondary record or something similar), it's possible that this is not a standard location for scripts. Also, the repetition is a red flag. \n\nThe confidence level here would be high because of the volume and repetition of the same event.

The winlog field has a task, and most of them are \"Execute a Remote Command\". The file path is consistently \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\" for each of those entries.\n\nWait, there are a few entries where the task is \"None\" and \"Windows Update Agent\", but the majority are still the same. Now, the file path is the same across multiple entries. That's a red flag. If the same PowerShell script is being executed multiple times, especially with the task \"Execute a Remote Command\", that could indicate something malicious. PowerShell scripts are often used in attacks for various purposes, like downloading payloads or executing commands remotely.\n\nBut I should check if there's any variation. All the entries with the same file path have the same task. However, the fact that it's repeated so many times (like 14 times) might be significant. Even if it's a legitimate script, executing it multiple times in a short period could be suspicious. Also, the process being \"None\" might mean that the event isn't tied to a specific process, which could be a system event or maybe an event that's not properly logged with process information.\n\nAnother thing is that the file path is in a directory named \"registro_secundario\" which translates to \"secondary record\" or \"secondary registration\" in Portuguese. That might be a red herring, but sometimes attackers use non-standard directory names to avoid detection. The script's name is \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\" which is \"auxiliary component\" in Portuguese. Again, maybe just a name, but could be part of a larger attack.\n\nHowever, there are a few entries where the task is \"Windows Update Agent\" and \"None\". Those might be normal system events. But the majority of the logs are about executing that same script repeatedly. If this is part of a normal system process, it might be logged multiple times, but I need to consider the context. Without more information, the repetition of the same command and the same script path is suspicious.\n\nAlso, the fact that the process is \"None\" for all these events might indicate that the logging system isn't capturing the process details, which could be a problem. Alternatively, it might be a system-level task that doesn't have an associated process. However, in cybersecurity, when you see the same event repeated multiple times with the same parameters, especially involving remote command execution, it's a potential indicator of compromise.\n\nSo, putting this all together: repeated execution of the same PowerShell script with the same path, the same task, and no associated process.
