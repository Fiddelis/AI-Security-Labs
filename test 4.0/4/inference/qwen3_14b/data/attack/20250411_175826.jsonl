{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. But then I see powershell.exe appearing several times. Now, PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. Let me check the details.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events, there's a command line that stands out: \"Get-ChildItem ... | %% { $_.LastWriteTime = ... }\". This seems like it's modifying the last write time of files, which could be an attempt to hide malicious activity by altering timestamps. That's suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET DLLs, which is normal. However, the presence of \"MpOAV.dll\" from Windows Defender might be a red herring, but it's still a legitimate file. The key point here is the modification of file timestamps, which is a common evasion technique.\n\nAlso, there's a FileCreate and then FileDelete event for a temporary script file. Creating and then deleting a script could be part of an attack where the script is executed and then cleaned up. The filename includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be a legitimate test, but combined with the other actions, it's worth looking into.\n\nOther events involve Registry value sets and process accesses, which aren't inherently malicious but could indicate some level of system manipulation. The presence of 'whoami.exe' is normal, but when combined with PowerShell activities, it might be part of a larger sequence.\n\nConsidering all these points, while some activities are normal, the combination of modifying file timestamps, creating and deleting scripts, and multiple PowerShell operations raises suspicion. It's not a clear-cut attack, but there's enough unusual behavior to warrant further investigation. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including file timestamp modification, temporary script creation\/deletion, and potential .NET assembly loading patterns that may indicate evasion techniques or malicious payload execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. There's a lot of PowerShell activity here. Multiple entries show command lines where PowerShell is modifying the LastWriteTime of files to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\", which is the Unix epoch. That's a common tactic used by attackers to hide files by changing their timestamps, making them harder to detect. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they seem to be in various directories, some with names like \"modulo_logico\", \"componente_padrao\", \"modulo_temporario\", etc. These might be part of a specific application or system, but the fact that multiple files are being altered in this way is suspicious. \n\nThen there are entries about 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll'. While that's a legitimate DLL, if it's being loaded in an unusual context, it could be a red flag. However, in this case, the entries don't show any obvious malicious activity beyond the PowerShell commands. \n\nThe 'svchost.exe' processes are setting registry values. That's normal for system services, but repeated entries might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' entry is creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file is normal, but the name '.winlogbeat.yml.new' might be part of a setup process. However, since it's in the user's Downloads folder, it's probably user-initiated.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated PowerShell commands altering file timestamps. This behavior is often associated with data exfiltration or hiding files. The fact that multiple files across different directories are being modified in this way suggests a possible attack. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any other context. Are there any failed login attempts, network connections to suspicious IPs, or other anomalies? From the given data, there's no mention of network activity or other system events. The rest of the entries are standard process activities.\n\nSo, the main concern is the PowerShell scripts modifying timestamps. This is a suspicious pattern, but without more evidence, it's a moderate indicator. The confidence isn't 100% because it's possible that these are legitimate scripts, but the repetition and the specific method of altering timestamps make it worth investigating. \n\nTherefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75. The justification is the multiple PowerShell commands changing file timestamps to a specific date, which is a known technique in attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are modifying file LastWriteTime attributes to '01\/01\/1970 00:00:00' (Unix epoch), a common tactic to hide files.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. Most of them are normal processes, but powershell.exe is often used in attacks. Let me check the events related to powershell.\n\nThe first entry for powershell.exe has a Registry value set. That's a common event, but not necessarily bad. Then there's another entry where powershell.exe is accessing a process. Maybe that's normal, but not sure yet.\n\nThen, chrome.exe has several Registry value set events. That's a lot, but maybe just normal operations. However, there's an Image loaded event for chrome.exe with amsi.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process loads it, that's normal. But if it's being loaded by something suspicious, that could be a problem. However, here it's chrome.exe, which is a legitimate process. So maybe that's okay.\n\nAnother Image loaded event for chrome.exe points to MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's real-time protection. Again, legitimate. So those might not be issues.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file could be normal. But the file path is .winlogbeat.yml.new. Maybe that's part of a setup or update. The user might have installed it, but it's not suspicious unless there's other activity.\n\nAnother file created by powershell.exe is unidade_logico.txt in the Downloads folder. Creating a text file isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of data exfiltration, that's a problem. However, with just this information, it's hard to tell. Maybe the user is just creating a file.\n\nNow, looking at the frequency. Chrome.exe has multiple Registry value set events. While registry changes can be normal, a high number might indicate something like a worm or malware modifying the registry. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, the presence of multiple events from chrome.exe might be worth investigating.\n\nAlso, the presence of both amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll being loaded by chrome.exe could be a red flag if those DLLs are not supposed to be loaded by chrome. But since they are part of Windows Defender, and chrome is a legitimate app, maybe it's okay. However, if the paths are different or if the DLLs are not signed, that would be a problem. The paths here look legitimate.\n\nAnother point: the winlogbeat file creation. If the user is using winlogbeat, that's normal. But if it's not expected, that could be a sign of a new tool being introduced.\n\nPutting it all together: there are a lot of registry changes, especially from chrome.exe, which is unusual. The ImageLoad events for Defender DLLs might be normal, but the high number of registry events could indicate something. However, without more context like unusual processes or network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. The presence of a few suspicious events might not be enough to classify as interesting, but the high frequency of registry changes from chrome could be a sign of something. I think the confidence is moderate here. Maybe 0.6. But I need to check if there's a clear malicious pattern. Since there's no clear indication of malware or attack, but the frequency is high, it's on the edge. Maybe \"INTERESTING\" because the high number of registry changes from chrome.exe could be a sign of an attack, but not certain. The justification would be the high number of registry modifications by chrome.exe, which may indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events by chrome.exe (13 instances) and powershell.exe, which may indicate unusual behavior. While some events are benign (e.g., loading legitimate DLLs like amsi.dll), the high frequency of registry changes could suggest potential malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
