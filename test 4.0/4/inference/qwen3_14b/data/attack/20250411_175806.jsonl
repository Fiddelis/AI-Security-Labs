{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. Hmm, so there's a bunch of process creation and registry events. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and created. That's common, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's whoami.exe, which is a normal command to get user info. But wait, there's also cmd.exe running commands to add entries to the registry under Run keys. Like, REG ADD commands adding \"registro_auxiliar\" and \"entrada_principal\" pointing to some executables. That seems suspicious because adding to the Run key can be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nAlso, there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\modulo_padrao.txt by powershell.exe. Not sure yet. Then winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's normal. But the same file is created twice, maybe a configuration file? \n\nLooking at the registry events, the cmd.exe and reg.exe are modifying the Run keys. That's a red flag because attackers often use these to ensure their malware runs at startup. The fact that multiple processes are involved in modifying the registry and creating files could indicate an attempt to install persistent backdoors.\n\nAlso, the use of both powershell.exe and cmd.exe for these actions might be part of a multi-stage attack. The combination of process creation, registry modification, and file creation in user directories could be signs of malicious activity. The presence of \"modulo_padrao.txt\" and the repeated file creation by winlogbeat might be benign, but the registry changes are more concerning.\n\nI should check if the files mentioned are known malicious. But since I don't have that info, relying on the actions. Modifying Run keys is a classic attack technique. So the batch shows suspicious behavior that's worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: registry modifications in Run keys (common in persistence mechanisms), repeated PowerShell and CMD process creations, and file creation in user directories. These patterns align with malware installation and persistence techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
