{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to analyze these log entries to see if there's any malicious activity. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries with powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a red flag. Then there's whoami.exe, which is a legitimate tool that shows user info, but if it's used in a suspicious context, it could be part of an attack.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe entries, one of them has a command line that's trying to create a service called win32times with a binPath pointing to a script that doesn't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1). That seems suspicious because creating a service with a non-existent script might be an attempt to hide malicious code or to set up a backdoor. The command line uses sc create, which is used to create services, and the path includes a .ps1 file, which is a PowerShell script. Even though the file isn't found, the attempt itself is concerning.\n\nAnother entry shows sc.exe creating the same service again, which might be part of trying to persist the malicious activity. The use of sc qc win32times checks the service configuration, which could be part of the attacker verifying their setup.\n\nThere are multiple Registry value set events. Changing registry values can be part of configuring persistence or modifying system settings to hide the attack. Processes like services.exe and svchost.exe are involved, which are normal system processes, but if they're being used to modify the registry in unusual ways, that's a problem.\n\nThe image loaded events for urlmon.dll are normal because that's a standard Windows DLL, so those might not be significant on their own. However, combined with other activities, they might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell accesses and the attempt to create a service with a non-existent script suggests someone is trying to execute scripts or set up persistence. The fact that the script isn't found could mean the attacker is trying to run it from a location that's not accessible, or it's a typo, but either way, it's suspicious.\n\nPutting this all together: the combination of creating a service with a non-existent PowerShell script, multiple registry modifications, and repeated PowerShell accesses points towards potential malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be benign, but the pattern here is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated PowerShell access, creation of a service with a non-existent PowerShell script (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1 and c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1), registry modifications by system processes, and attempts to execute commands via sc.exe. These patterns suggest potential malicious activity for persistence or execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipper and might be setting up configuration files. But wait, the file path is in the Downloads directory, which isn't typical for system processes. Maybe someone is trying to tamper with the configuration?\n\nThen there are multiple entries for chrome.exe and powershell.exe related to registry changes and process access. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, but maybe it's being manipulated. However, looking at the image loaded events, chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are legitimate Windows Defender files. That's normal.\n\nThe other processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe modifying the registry might be benign. But the repetition of chrome.exe's registry changes could be a red flag. However, without more context like unusual command-line arguments or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say. The main suspicious thing is the winlogbeat file in the Downloads folder. Maybe it's a sign of a compromised system where an attacker is trying to place malicious configurations. But I need to check if that's a common occurrence. Since the rest of the events don't show obvious signs of malware, maybe it's a false positive. But the presence of that file in a non-standard location is still concerning. I'll rate it as interesting but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a suspicious file creation event for '.winlogbeat.yml.new' in the user's Downloads directory, which is an unusual location for logbeat configuration files. While other events involve legitimate processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe) performing normal operations, the combination of non-standard file placement and multiple registry modification events warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
