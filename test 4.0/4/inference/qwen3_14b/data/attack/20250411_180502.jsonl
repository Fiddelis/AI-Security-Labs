{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple DNS queries and network connections from chrome.exe. That's normal, as Chrome often communicates over the network. But then there's a bunch of events related to powershell.exe. \n\nLooking at the powershell events, there's a command line that starts a process with a bat file. The paths here are a bit odd. For example, the command line includes \"C:\\\\pacote_comum\\\\objeto_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_secundario\\\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\". The use of \"..\\\\\" suggests that the path is trying to navigate up a directory and then back down. This could be a way to obfuscate the actual path, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are several image loads from .NET DLLs, which might be normal if PowerShell is running a script that uses .NET. However, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll being loaded could be a red flag. MpOAV is related to real-time protection, so if it's being loaded by PowerShell, maybe there's an attempt to bypass or interact with the antivirus.\n\nThere's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common technique used by malware to execute scripts temporarily without leaving traces. The file is named with a random string, which is another sign of obfuscation.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with different bat files being executed. The paths here again use relative paths with \"..\\\\\", which might be an attempt to hide the true location of the scripts. If these scripts are executing commands that are not user-initiated, that could be malicious.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these activities could be legitimate. For example, PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, and network connections from Chrome are normal. But the combination of these events—especially the obfuscated paths, temporary file creation and deletion, and multiple image loads from system DLLs—raises suspicion. \n\nThe confidence here isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of a breach, but the patterns are indicative of potential malicious activity. So, I'd classify this as \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75. The justification is the combination of obfuscated paths, temporary files, and multiple suspicious PowerShell activities that could indicate an attempted intrusion or script-based attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show obfuscated command-line paths with '..\\\\' directory traversal, temporary file creation\/deletion, and loading of system DLLs (e.g., clr.dll, mscoree.dll). These patterns suggest potential script-based attacks or lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are about processes like powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and cmd.exe. Some of them have registry value sets, image loads, or process accesses. But the key thing here is the command lines in the process entries. \n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are several instances where powershell.exe is used to start processes with paths that have \"..\\\" in them. For example, \"C:\\\\objeto_padrao\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\..\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\entrada_base_script.bat\". The use of \"..\\\\\" suggests that the path is navigating up a directory and then back down. This could be a way to obfuscate the actual path, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts to avoid detection.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the paths in these command lines don't seem to follow a standard structure. They have parts like \"tarefa_ativo\" and \"estrutura_base\" which might be random or obfuscated names. Also, the fact that multiple different paths are used in the command lines might indicate that the attacker is trying to execute scripts from various locations, possibly to avoid detection or to run different payloads.\n\nHowever, there are also normal processes like Calculator.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe, which are legitimate. Chrome.exe is mentioned multiple times, but those entries don't have suspicious command lines. The image load events for MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll are part of Windows Defender and URLMon, which are legitimate components. \n\nBut the repeated use of PowerShell with these obfuscated paths is a red flag. Even though some of the events are normal, the combination of multiple suspicious PowerShell commands with unusual paths increases the likelihood of malicious activity. The presence of \"File created\" event for a StartupProfileData-NonInteractive might also be a sign of something trying to persist or modify PowerShell configurations.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the batch does show some suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. However, there's not enough information to confirm it's definitely malicious, but the indicators are there. The confidence is around 0.75 because while there are suspicious elements, they could be part of normal operations if the paths are legitimate. But the obfuscation and multiple instances make it more likely to be interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute obfuscated command lines with suspicious path navigation (e.g., '..\\\\') and non-standard directory structures, which may indicate evasion techniques or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and chrome.exe are all setting registry values. That's a common activity, but maybe not suspicious on its own. However, I notice that chrome.exe is involved in multiple registry changes. Then, looking further, there are entries where chrome.exe loads images, specifically amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process like chrome.exe is loading this DLL, that might be normal. But then there's a file created by powershell.exe in the user's Downloads folder, which could be benign, like a text file. However, the presence of multiple registry changes by chrome.exe might be unusual. \n\nWait, but why is chrome.exe making so many registry changes? Typically, chrome doesn't modify the registry that much unless there's some malicious activity. Also, the other entries involve svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization directory, which is part of Windows Update. That's probably normal. However, the repeated registry events by chrome.exe could indicate something. Maybe a registry modification is part of a payload or configuration change. But I need to check if there's any suspicious file paths or other processes involved. \n\nAnother thing is that winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal if it's being set up. But the user's own processes creating files in Downloads might be okay. However, the combination of multiple registry changes by chrome.exe and the loading of specific DLLs might be worth looking into. \n\nBut wait, the Image loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are from chrome.exe. Is that normal? I think that's unusual. Those DLLs are part of Windows Defender, so if chrome.exe is loading them, maybe it's trying to bypass detection or interact with the antivirus. Alternatively, maybe it's a false positive. But combined with the numerous registry changes, this could be a sign of something malicious. \n\nHowever, the justification needs to be concise. The main points are the multiple registry changes by chrome.exe and the loading of security-related DLLs. Also, the creation of files by powershell.exe in the Downloads directory might be benign, but the combination of events could indicate a potential issue. \n\nI think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because of the unusual number of registry modifications by chrome.exe and the loading of specific DLLs, which might indicate malicious activity. The confidence is around 0.75 because while some events are normal, the combination raises suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe instances performing suspicious registry modifications and loading security-related DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), which may indicate evasion techniques or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
