That path doesn't look standard. Creating a new service could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender. While some of these are legitimate, the presence of multiple image loads might be normal for PowerShell, but combined with other events, it could be a red flag.\n\nThere's a FileCreate and then a FileDelete event for a temporary script file. That might be part of a script being executed and then cleaned up, which is common in attacks to avoid leaving evidence.\n\nThe services.exe entries have multiple Registry value set events.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user wants me to analyze all the events together and determine if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's 'services.exe', 'tarefa_logico.exe', 'powershell.exe', 'MsMpEng.exe', and 'svchost.exe'. Some of these are legitimate system processes, like services.exe and svchost.exe. But 'tarefa_logico.exe' doesn't ring a bell. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Like 'tarefa' in Portuguese might mean 'task', but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a malicious process? Or maybe a legitimate one that's not commonly known.\n\nNow, looking at the events. The first few entries are about 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading various DLLs, including mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others related to the .NET Framework. Loading .NET DLLs isn't necessarily bad, but if a process that's not typically associated with .NET is doing this, it could be suspicious. However, 'tarefa_logico.exe' might be a legitimate application that uses .NET, but I'm not certain. It's possible that this is just a normal application startup, but the name is unfamiliar.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' setting registry values. These processes are common and often interact with the registry as part of their normal operations, like managing services. However, multiple registry changes could be a sign of something, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The same goes for 'MsMpEng.exe', which is part of Windows Defender, so setting registry values there might be normal.\n\nThe 'powershell.exe' events include a file creation in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a legitimate place for PowerShell profiles, but creating a file there isn't inherently malicious. However, if there were other suspicious activities related to PowerShell, like executing scripts or downloading files, that would be a red flag. But in this case, it's just a file creation.\n\nAnother event is a file created by 'None' (unknown process) in the WindowsUpdate logs. That might be a normal system log file, so probably not suspicious.\n\nPutting this all together, the main suspicious point is 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading multiple .NET DLLs. If that process is not known to the system or isn't a standard application, it could be a sign of a malicious payload. However, without more information on what 'tarefa_logico.exe' is, it's hard to be certain. The other events don't seem to indicate obvious malicious activity, but the combination of an unknown process loading multiple DLLs might be worth investigating further. The confidence here would be moderate, maybe around 0.6, because it's not conclusive but there's enough to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The process 'tarefa_logico.exe' is loading multiple .NET Framework DLLs (e.g., clr.dll, mscoree.dll), which may indicate a legitimate application but could also suggest a malicious payload using .NET for execution.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first 12 entries, they're all about 'svchost.exe' performing 'Registry value set' tasks. Now, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, multiple registry changes could be a red flag, especially if they're all the same. But since they're all from svchost.exe and the same task, maybe it's just normal system activity. But I should check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nThen, starting from the 13th event, there's 'setup.exe' creating several files in the Program Files (x86) directory under Microsoft EdgeCore. The files include msedge.exe, msedgewebview2.exe, and others. Now, setup.exe is typically associated with installation processes. But creating multiple executable files in a directory that's part of Microsoft Edge's installation path might be normal during an installation. However, I need to check if these files are part of a legitimate installation or if they're suspicious.\n\nWait, the 20th event shows setup.exe creating another setup.exe in the Installer subdirectory. That's a bit odd. Usually, during installation, the setup executable might create other files, but creating another setup.exe could be a sign of something unusual. Also, the 21st event shows setup.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate Windows DLL related to Task Scheduler. But loading it might be normal.\n\nAnother thing to note is the presence of a batch file named 'show_third_party_software_licenses.bat' created by setup.exe. Batch files can be used for various purposes, but in this context, it's part of the installation process, so maybe it's okay.\n\nHowever, the combination of multiple registry changes by svchost.exe and the creation of numerous files by setup.exe might indicate an installation or update process. But since all the events are related to legitimate processes (svchost.exe and setup.exe) and files associated with Microsoft Edge, it might be a normal activity. However, the repetition of registry events could be a sign of something more if they're not part of a standard process.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the batch should be considered as a whole. If all these events are part of a legitimate software installation (like Microsoft Edge), then it's not interesting. However, if the setup.exe is not part of a known legitimate installation, or if the registry changes are unusual, that could be a problem. But the logs don't provide details like the user context, the specific registry keys modified, or any other indicators of compromise.\n\nIn this case, since the processes involved are legitimate and the files created are part of Microsoft Edge's directory, it might be a normal installation. However, the high number of registry events from svchost.exe might still be worth looking into. But without more context, it's hard to say. The confidence here would be moderate. The justification would be that the events involve legitimate processes but the volume of registry changes and file creations could be indicative of an installation or potential malicious activity. However, since the files are associated with Microsoft Edge, it's more likely a legitimate process. Therefore, the classification might be 'NOT INTERESTING' with a confidence around 0.6, but I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, if the setup.exe is creating files in a directory that's not part of a standard installation, that might be suspicious. But the path given is 'C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Microsoft\\\\EdgeCore\\\\...' which seems legitimate for Edge. The presence of 'setup.exe' creating another setup.exe in the Installer folder might be a red flag. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe the system is undergoing an update or reinstallation of Edge. So, the conclusion is that while some events are normal, the combination might not be suspicious enough to be considered interesting for investigation. Therefore, the answer is 'NOT INTERESTING' with a confidence of 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events involves legitimate processes (`svchost.exe`, `setup.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`) and file creations associated with Microsoft Edge installation directories. While the high volume of registry changes by `svchost.exe` and file creation by `setup.exe` could raise initial suspicion, the context (e.g., file paths, process names) aligns with typical software installation or update activities. No clear indicators of compromise (e.g., unexpected registry keys, malicious file hashes, or anomalous network activity) are present in the logs. The presence of a batch file (`show_third_party_software_licenses.bat`) is consistent with standard installer behavior. \n\n**Classification**: `NOT INTERESTING`  \n**Confidence**: 0.6 (moderate)  \n**Justification**: The events appear to align with legitimate system and software installation processes, despite the volume of activity. No overt signs of malicious behavior are evident in the provided logs."}

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nMost of the events here are about registry changes, specifically 'Registry value set' and 'Registry object added or deleted' tasks. The processes involved are svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe. Svchost and services are legitimate system processes, but setup.exe is typically associated with installation processes. However, the majority of the events are registry changes, which are common during system updates or installations, so maybe that's normal.\n\nBut wait, there are a few file creation events. The setup.exe process is creating files like msedge_proxy.exe and pwahelper.exe under the Program Files directory for Microsoft Edge. Also, there's a shortcut created in the Start Menu and Quick Launch. Now, Microsoft Edge is a legitimate application, so these files might be part of an installation. But creating shortcuts and executables under system directories could be suspicious if they're not part of a known installation.\n\nHowever, the presence of setup.exe creating these files might be part of a legitimate Edge installation. But I need to check if there are any signs of malicious activity. The logs don't show any unusual processes or unexpected network activity.

However, the confidence here is a bit low because without more context, like if this is part of a known installation or if there are other suspicious activities, it's hard to tell. The classification is interesting because there are multiple file creations that could be part of an installation, but it's not clearly malicious. So the justification would be that there are file creations related to Microsoft Edge, which could be legitimate, but the high number of registry changes and setup.exe activities warrant further investigation.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing some system event. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them are about 'setup.exe' performing registry operations. There are multiple entries where 'setup.exe' is setting registry values or modifying registry objects. Then there are a few entries where 'setup.exe' is creating pipes. Then, there's one entry where 'RuntimeBroker.exe' is setting a registry value. But the more concerning part is the 'svchost.exe' entries. \n\nLooking at the 'svchost.exe' events, they're all about files being created in the Windows Temp directory and in 'AppReadiness'. The file paths are like 'APPX.eupxogogonk2uz72tg0nuo3qd.tmp' and similar. The AppReadiness folder is part of Windows' system, and creating files there might be suspicious. Also, the fact that svchost.exe is creating so many temporary files in Temp could be a red flag. \n\nNow, svchost.exe is a legitimate process that hosts various system services, but it's also a common vector for malware to hide. The combination of multiple registry changes by setup.exe and the creation of numerous temporary files by svchost.exe might indicate some kind of installation or malicious activity. However, setup.exe could be part of a legitimate software installation. But the high number of registry modifications and file creations, especially in system directories, raises suspicion. \n\nThe presence of 'RuntimeBroker.exe' is normal as it's related to UAC, but it's only one entry. The key points here are the repeated registry changes and the numerous file creations in system directories. These could be signs of a malicious process trying to modify system settings and leave behind files. However, without more context like the actual content of the registry changes or the files, it's a bit tricky. But given the volume and the locations, this seems suspicious enough to warrant investigation. \n\nSo, I think this batch is interesting. The confidence is high because of the multiple registry modifications and the unusual file creation in protected directories.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all mention 'svchost.exe' creating files in the WindowsApps directory and AppReadiness folder. The EdgeGameAssist.exe file is in the WindowsApps folder, which is part of the Microsoft Edge Game Assist. But svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, often used to host various system services. However, creating files in AppReadiness might be suspicious. Wait, AppReadiness is a legitimate system component too, but creating multiple files with SIDs in the path—those look like security identifiers. Maybe that's normal? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events by svchost.exe. Changing registry values can be a red flag if done by a malicious process. But again, svchost.exe is a system process, so maybe it's just part of normal operations. However, multiple registry changes might indicate something more.\n\nThen there's RuntimeBroker.exe setting registry values. RuntimeBroker is associated with UAC prompts and app permissions, so that might be normal. But again, multiple changes could be suspicious.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that's just writing a host message. That seems benign. But then there are image loads of various DLLs, including mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. PowerShell loading these is normal for running scripts, but maybe if there's unexpected behavior here.\n\nWait, the first entry's file path is C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps\\Microsoft.Edge.GameAssist_1.0.3336.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\\EdgeGameAssist.exe. The WindowsApps folder is for apps installed via the Microsoft Store, so Edge Game Assist is a legitimate app. But svchost.exe creating that file? Wait, svchost.exe is part of the system, but creating an app's executable might be unusual. Maybe that's a sign of something wrong. Or perhaps it's a normal part of the app's installation?\n\nThen, looking at the repetition of the same file paths in AppReadiness with SIDs. The SIDs are part of user or computer accounts. Maybe the system is creating these files as part of some legitimate process, like user profile creation or system updates. But multiple entries for the same file could indicate a loop or an error.\n\nThe registry events are all from svchost.exe, which is a system process. However, if there are a lot of registry changes, that might be a sign of malware trying to modify system settings. But again, svchost.exe can be hosting services that make registry changes.\n\nThe PowerShell process seems to be running a simple command, but the image loads of .NET DLLs are normal for PowerShell. However, if there's a lot of image loading or unexpected DLLs, that could be a problem. The paths listed are standard system paths, so that's probably okay.\n\nPutting it all together: there are multiple file creations and registry changes by svchost.exe, which is a system process. While some of these might be normal, the repetition and the specific locations (like AppReadiness with SIDs) could be indicators of something unusual. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. The presence of PowerShell might be normal, but the combination of these events might warrant further investigation. Maybe the system is under attack, or maybe it's just normal activity. But given that svchost.exe is involved in creating files and changing the registry, and considering that svchost can be exploited, this might be a red flag. However, I need to check if these activities are typical for svchost.exe.\n\nWait, svchost.exe usually doesn't create files in the AppReadiness directory. That might be a sign of something wrong. Also, the SIDs in the file paths are part of the system's security model, but creating files with those names could be part of a malicious process trying to hide or mimic system files. Alternatively, it could be a legitimate process, but the repetition is concerning.\n\nIn conclusion, while some of these events might be normal, the combination of multiple file creations and registry changes by a system process, along with the specific paths involved, could indicate a potential security issue. Therefore, this log might be worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries contain a mix of normal system activities and potential indicators of suspicious behavior, warranting further investigation. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity:**\n1. **Unusual File Creations by `svchost.exe`:**\n   - **`EdgeGameAssist.exe` in `WindowsApps` folder:** While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate system process, it typically does not create executable files in the `WindowsApps` directory (used for Microsoft Store apps). This could indicate a misconfiguration or malicious activity attempting to mimic legitimate processes.\n   - **Repetitive File Creations in `AppReadiness` with SIDs:** The repeated creation of files with paths like `C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness\\{SID}` (e.g., `S-1-5-21-...`) is unusual. These SIDs are part of Windows security identifiers, and such activity might be related to user profile manipulation, privilege escalation, or malware attempting to persist by leveraging system directories.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications by `svchost.exe`:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events by `svchost.exe` could be normal (e.g., system updates or service configurations). However, the lack of context (e.g., specific keys or values modified) makes it difficult to determine legitimacy. Malware often modifies registry keys to alter system behavior or persistence.\n\n3. **`RuntimeBroker.exe` Registry Changes:**\n   - While `RuntimeBroker.exe` is associated with UAC prompts and app permissions, its involvement in registry modifications could be benign. However, combined with other suspicious events, it raises questions about potential elevation of privileges or tampering.\n\n---\n\n### **Benign Activity:**\n1. **PowerShell Execution:**\n   - The `powershell.exe` process running a simple `Write-Host` command is harmless. The subsequent image loads of `.NET` DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are standard for PowerShell operations and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n2. **Legitimate DLL Loads:**\n   - The loaded DLLs (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`) are part of the .NET Framework and are expected during PowerShell execution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some events (e.g., PowerShell operations) are benign, the **repetitive file creations in `AppReadiness`** and **registry modifications by `svchost.exe`** are **potential red flags**. These could indicate:\n- **Malware persistence** (e.g., creating files in system directories to evade detection).\n- **Privilege escalation** attempts (e.g., modifying registry keys to alter system behavior).\n- **Misconfigurations** or **third-party software interference**.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Correlate these logs with other system telemetry (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to determine intent.\n- Check for unexpected processes or services hosted by `svchost.exe` (use tools like `Process Explorer`).\n- Monitor the `AppReadiness` directory for unauthorized file creation.\n- Review registry changes for suspicious keys (e.g., `HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`).\n\n**Final Verdict:** **Investigate further** due to the unusual combination of events involving system-critical processes and directories."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first event: PowerShell.exe is loading an image called MpOAV.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That's a legitimate file, right? Windows Defender's own DLLs are usually signed and part of the system. But then I see another event where PowerShell creates a file in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_... That seems suspicious. Temp files can be used for malicious purposes, especially if they're created by PowerShell scripts.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event, but no file involved. Not sure about that yet. Then, multiple Image Loaded events for various .NET DLLs like clrjit.dll, mscoree.dll, etc. Those are standard .NET components, so they're probably normal. But then there's another MpOAV.dll loaded again. Maybe that's just part of the system processes, but I need to check if there's any unusual activity.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate tool to check user context. But the command line for PowerShell includes a script that's scanning INF files for defaultinstall sections. That might be part of a script checking for driver installations or something, but why would that be a concern? Maybe it's looking for signs of tampering or unauthorized installations.\n\nAnother File Created event in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's part of PowerShell's startup profiles, so maybe the user is configuring something. But the command line for another PowerShell process is running a script that checks INF files. This could be a red flag if the script is trying to detect or exploit vulnerabilities in the INF files.\n\nWait, the script's command line is using Get-Item to retrieve INF files and then checking for patterns like [defaultinstall.nt...]. That might be related to driver installation or configuration. If the script is trying to find specific sections in INF files, it could be part of a malicious attempt to modify system settings or install drivers without permission. But I need to see if there's any indication of malicious intent here.\n\nAlso, multiple ImageLoad events for Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. Since those are part of Windows Defender, they're legitimate. However, if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a problem. But the events don't show any signs of that.\n\nLooking at the FileCreate events in the Temp directory. Those files have names like __PSScriptPolicyTest... which might be part of PowerShell's script execution policy testing. But creating multiple files in Temp could be a sign of temporary malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe presence of multiple ImageLoad events for .NET components is normal, as PowerShell relies on the .NET framework. But the combination of creating files in Temp and running scripts that check INF files might be suspicious. However, the script itself doesn't have obviously malicious commands like downloading files or executing remote code. It's just checking the content of INF files.\n\nThe justification for classification would depend on whether these activities are out of the ordinary. If the system is running a legitimate script that's checking INF files for configuration purposes, then it's normal. But if there's no clear reason for these actions, it could be a sign of an attack. Since the events don't show clear malicious intent, but the activities are somewhat unusual, maybe it's worth investigating further. However, without more context, it's hard to determine. But since the user is asking for an analysis, I should point out the suspicious elements but note that they might not be malicious on their own.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events observed in the log show a mix of legitimate system activity and potentially suspicious behavior. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and analysis:\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n1. **Windows Defender DLLs (MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll):**  \n   These are signed, legitimate components of Windows Defender. Their loading is normal and expected in a healthy system.\n\n2. **.NET Framework DLLs (clrjit.dll, mscoree.dll, etc.):**  \n   These are standard components of the .NET runtime and are necessary for PowerShell execution. Their presence is benign.\n\n3. **`whoami.exe`:**  \n   A standard utility used to check user context. No malicious intent here.\n\n---\n\n### **Potentially Suspicious Activity**\n1. **File Creation in Temp Directory (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.psm1`):**  \n   - PowerShell scripts creating temporary files with names like `__PSScriptPolicyTest_...` may be part of **script execution policy testing** (e.g., checking if scripts are allowed to run). However, **multiple such files** in the Temp directory could indicate **unusual or automated script activity**.\n   - **Risk:** If these files are not part of a known legitimate process, they could be used for **staging malicious payloads** or **persisting access**.\n\n2. **INF File Scanning Script:**  \n   - The PowerShell command line includes a script that scans INF files for patterns like `[defaultinstall.nt...]`. This could be related to **driver installation** or **system configuration checks**, but the lack of context makes it ambiguous.\n   - **Risk:** If the script is probing for vulnerabilities in INF files (e.g., tampering with driver installation logic), it could be **part of a reconnaissance phase** for exploitation.\n\n3. **Pipe Creation Events:**  \n   - While not inherently malicious, **unnecessary pipe creation** could indicate **inter-process communication** for data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) activity. However, this requires further correlation with other logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Low to Medium Risk**\n- The activity does not show **clear signs of malware** (e.g., downloading payloads, encrypting files, or C2 traffic).  \n- However, the **combination of temporary file creation, script execution, and INF file scanning** raises **questions about intent**.  \n- **Recommendation:**  \n  - Investigate the **source of the PowerShell scripts** (e.g., user context, parent processes, and script content).  \n  - Check for **unusual modifications to INF files** or driver configurations.  \n  - Monitor **temp directory activity** for persistence or lateral movement.  \n\n**Final Classification:** **Interesting for further investigation** due to the unusual script behavior and temp file activity, but not definitively malicious without additional context."}

They might be malicious files being executed under the guise of legitimate ones.\n\nWait, but Dism.exe is a valid process. However, if it's generating these files in the Temp directory, that's unusual. The repeated detection of multiple .mui files could indicate an attempt to inject malicious code or a dropper that's unpacking payloads. The fact that all these files are being detected as executable might be a sign that they're not standard resources but actually executable files disguised as .mui files.\n\nAnother point is the GUID in the path. That's a common tactic for malware to create unique directories to avoid detection. The combination of Dism.exe creating multiple suspicious files in a temporary directory with a GUID name, all flagged as executable, suggests potential malicious activity. However, I should consider that there might be legitimate scenarios where Dism.exe operates in the Temp folder, but that's less common. \n\nI think the key here is the unusual location and the number of files being detected. Even though Dism.exe is legitimate, the context here points towards something suspicious. The classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.8 because there are multiple indicators pointing to potential malicious activity, but it's not definitive without further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"rationale\": \"Multiple .mui files (typically language resource files) are being created in a temporary directory by Dism.exe, which is unusual.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. All the events are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. Each entry has a winlog task indicating \"File Executable Detected\" under the rule FileExecutableDetected. The files mentioned are all .dll files located in the Temp directory under a specific GUID path.\n\nHmm, Dism.exe is known to be used in Windows Setup and imaging, so it's possible that these files are part of a legitimate installation or deployment process. However, the fact that so many executable files are being detected in the Temp folder might be suspicious. Typically, the Temp directory is a common place for malware to drop files, but since Dism is involved, it could be part of a system update or image deployment.\n\nWait, the filenames like SmiProvider.dll.mui, SysprepProvider.dll.mui, etc., some of these might be legitimate components related to Windows Setup. For example, Sysprep is used for preparing Windows installations. However, the presence of multiple .dll files in the Temp folder being executed by Dism.exe could indicate that someone is using Dism in an unusual way, perhaps to inject malicious code or modify system files.\n\nBut I need to check if these are normal operations. The GUID in the path suggests a temporary directory created by some process. If this is part of a legitimate system update or imaging process, then it's normal. However, if Dism.exe is being used to execute these files in a way that's not standard, that could be a red flag. Also, the fact that all these files are being detected as executables might be normal if they are indeed part of the imaging process, but I should consider the context.\n\nAnother angle: the rule FileExecutableDetected might be part of a security system's alerting. If the system is flagging these as suspicious, but Dism is a trusted process, maybe it's a false positive. However, if the files are not signed or are from an unknown source, that's a concern. But the logs don't mention anything about the files' origins or signatures.\n\nIn conclusion, while Dism.exe is legitimate, the high number of executable files in the Temp directory could be either part of a legitimate process or an indicator of malicious activity. Without more context, like the files' digital signatures or the specific commands being run by Dism, it's a bit ambiguous. However, given that the user is asking for analysis, it's safer to lean towards considering this as suspicious unless proven otherwise. Therefore, the logs might indicate a potential security issue that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that the **Dism.exe** process (a legitimate Windows tool for deployment and imaging) is detecting and interacting with multiple **.dll files** in a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B96820D89`). Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Legitimate Context**:\n   - **Dism.exe** is a trusted Windows utility used in system imaging, deployment, and setup processes. It often interacts with `.dll` files as part of its operations.\n   - The filenames (e.g., `SysprepProvider.dll`, `ImagingProvider.dll`) resemble components used in **Windows Setup** or **Sysprep** (a tool for preparing Windows installations). These could be part of a legitimate system deployment or update.\n\n2. **Suspicious Patterns**:\n   - **High Volume of Executable Files**: The detection of **16+ executable `.dll` files** in the Temp directory under a unique GUID path is unusual. While temporary directories are common for legitimate processes, the sheer number of `.dll` files being flagged as executable may warrant scrutiny.\n   - **Location in Temp Folder**: Malware often uses the Temp directory to stage files. However, this alone is not conclusive evidence of malicious activity, as Dism.exe may legitimately use this location during imaging.\n\n3. **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:\n   - **Unusual File Paths**: The GUID-based directory (`33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B96820D89`) is a common tactic for malware to obscure its presence. If this directory was not explicitly created by a trusted process, it could be a red flag.\n   - **Lack of Signing Information**: The logs do not mention whether the `.dll` files are digitally signed or originate from known Microsoft sources. Unsigned or unknown files could indicate tampering.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **Likely Legitimate**: If this activity occurs during a **system deployment, imaging, or Windows Setup** (e.g., during a fresh install or sysprep), the files may be part of the process.\n- **Potential Threat**: If this occurs in a **production environment** or **non-deployment context**, the activity could indicate **malware** using Dism.exe as a vector (e.g., through a compromised system or exploit).\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Verify Context**:\n   - Confirm whether the system is undergoing **legitimate deployment\/imaging** (e.g., via Windows Setup, SCCM, or similar tools).\n   - Check if the GUID directory was created by a trusted process (e.g., Dism.exe or Windows Setup).\n\n2. **Inspect Files**:\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **VirusTotal** to analyze the `.dll` files for malware signatures.\n   - Verify digital signatures (e.g., using `sigcheck` or `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` in PowerShell).\n\n3. **Monitor Behavior**:\n   - Use **EDR\/XDR tools** to monitor Dism.exe's behavior (e.g., network activity, registry changes) during this process.\n   - Check for unusual parent processes or command-line arguments (e.g., `dism \/image` commands).\n\n4. **Mitigation**:\n   - If this is **not part of a legitimate deployment**, isolate the system and investigate further.\n   - Ensure all system updates and imaging tools are from trusted sources.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the activity could be **legitimate** in a deployment context, the **high volume of executable files in a Temp directory** warrants further investigation. **Do not dismiss this as benign without verifying the files' origins and the system's context**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve Dism.exe detecting files like ProvProvider.dll, SetupPlatformProvider.dll, etc. The paths are all in the Temp directory under a specific GUID folder. The winlog task is \"File Executable Detected\" with the rule FileExecutableDetected. That seems a bit odd because Dism.exe is typically part of Windows Deployment, used for imaging and setup. But why would it be detecting so many DLLs in the Temp folder?\n\nThen there's an entry for DismHost.exe being created with a command line that includes a GUID. The next entries show DismHost.exe loading various DLLs from the same Temp directory. These DLLs include things like DismCorePS.dll, DismProv.dll, OSProvider.dll, etc. \n\nNow, the key point here is the location of these files. The Temp folder is a common place for legitimate temporary files, but when a process like Dism.exe or DismHost.exe is loading multiple DLLs from there, especially if they're not standard system files, it could be suspicious. However, Dism and DismHost are legitimate tools used in Windows setup and deployment. They might legitimately load various providers during operations like sysprep or image deployment.\n\nBut wait, the fact that all these files are in the Temp directory under a unique GUID folder might be a red flag. Typically, during legitimate operations, these files might be part of a known setup process, but if this is happening unexpectedly or in a context where it's not part of a known deployment, it could be malicious. However, without more context like the system's state or other logs, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the DismHost.exe process is loading multiple DLLs from the same directory. If these DLLs are not signed or are not known to be part of the Dism toolset, that would be a concern. But in the given logs, the filenames don't indicate any obvious malicious names. They are named like DismCorePS.dll, which might be a legitimate component.\n\nI should also consider the rules triggering the logs. The \"File Executable Detected\" and \"Image Load\" rules are part of security monitoring. If the system is configured to alert on these events, even legitimate activities might trigger alerts. However, the volume of events here (multiple DLLs loaded) might be more than usual for a normal operation.\n\nBut without knowing the baseline of what's normal for this system, it's hard to say. If this is part of a legitimate deployment or imaging process, then it's normal. If it's happening in an environment where such processes aren't expected, it might be suspicious. \n\nIn conclusion, while the logs show legitimate processes loading files from the Temp directory, the high number of DLLs and the specific paths might warrant further investigation. However, based solely on the provided information, it's not definitively malicious. But the presence of multiple image loads from a Temp folder could be a sign of something unusual, hence why the system is flagging it. So, I would lean towards classifying this as interesting for investigation but not necessarily malicious without more context.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show activity related to **Windows Deployment Services (WDS)** tools (`Dism.exe`, `DismHost.exe`) loading multiple DLLs from a temporary directory. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Tools Involved:**\n   - `Dism.exe` and `DismHost.exe` are standard Windows tools used for imaging, deployment, and sysprep operations. Their presence alone is **not suspicious**.\n\n2. **File Paths and Context:**\n   - All files are in the **`%TEMP%` directory** under a GUID-specific folder (e.g., `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\{GUID}\\...`). This is **common for temporary files** during deployment or imaging processes.\n\n3. **Image Load Events:**\n   - Multiple DLLs (e.g., `DismProv.dll`, `OSProvider.dll`, `CbsProvider.dll`) are loaded by `DismHost.exe`. These are **known components** of the Windows Imaging and Deployment infrastructure.\n\n4. **Potential Red Flags:**\n   - **High Volume of Image Loads:** While not inherently malicious, the **number of DLLs loaded** from the same temporary directory could indicate an **unusual or unmonitored deployment process**.\n   - **Absence of Context:** If this activity occurs **outside of a known deployment window** (e.g., during normal system operation), it may warrant further investigation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **Classification:** **Interesting for investigation**, but **not definitively malicious**.\n- **Reason:** The activity aligns with **legitimate deployment workflows**, but the lack of context (e.g., no clear indication of a sysprep or image deployment in progress) and the high volume of image loads could indicate an **unexpected or unmonitored process**.\n- **Recommendation:** \n  - Check if this activity occurs during a **known deployment or imaging event**.\n  - Verify the **signing status** of the loaded DLLs to ensure they are legitimate.\n  - Monitor for **additional anomalous behavior** (e.g., network connections, registry changes) around this time.\n\n**Final Verdict:** The logs are **not malicious**, but they **merit further scrutiny** to confirm they are part of an authorized process."}

The files have names like IntlProvider.dll, IBSProvider.dll, etc. All these DLLs are in the same Temp folder with a unique GUID. Then there's a Dism.exe process deleting some of these DLLs. \n\nNow, DismHost.exe is part of the Deployment Imaging Service and Management (DISM) tool, which is used for Windows image management. Typically, DISM is used by administrators for tasks like applying updates or configuring images. However, the fact that multiple DLLs are being loaded from a temporary directory might be suspicious. Legitimate uses of DISM usually don't involve loading so many custom DLLs from Temp, especially ones with names that don't seem standard.\n\nAlso, the deletion of the DLLs by Dism.exe could be part of a cleanup process, but the combination of loading many DLLs and then deleting them might indicate something unusual. Maybe the DLLs were used for some operation and then removed. But why so many different providers? That could be part of a normal operation, but it's also a red flag.\n\nAnother point is the path: the Temp folder is a common place for malicious software to store temporary files. The presence of multiple DLLs being loaded from there might suggest that the system is executing code from a temporary location, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nHowever, I should consider that DISM might have legitimate reasons to load various providers. But the number of DLLs here seems high. Also, the fact that Dism.exe is deleting the files after they're loaded could be part of a normal process, but combined with the loading of so many different DLLs, it's a bit suspicious.\n\nI should check if there are any known legitimate scenarios where DISM loads so many DLLs from Temp. If not, this might be a sign of something malicious. Alternatively, it could be a user running DISM with custom scripts or configurations that include these providers. But without more context, the logs show a pattern that's worth investigating further.\n\nSo, considering all that, the combination of multiple DLL loads from Temp by DismHost.exe and the subsequent deletions by Dism.exe does seem unusual and could indicate a potential security issue. Therefore, this batch of events is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events described exhibits patterns that warrant further investigation due to potential security implications. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Unusual Volume of DLL Loads by `DismHost.exe`:**\n   - **14 DLLs** (e.g., `IntlProvider.dll`, `SysprepProvider.dll`, `TransmogProvider.dll`) are loaded from a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\`). \n   - While `DismHost.exe` is a legitimate component of DISM (used for Windows image management), **loading 14 distinct DLLs from a temporary folder** is highly atypical. Legitimate DISM operations typically involve a smaller, more predictable set of modules.\n\n2. **Suspicious File Deletion by `Dism.exe`:**\n   - **`Dism.exe`** deletes several of the same DLLs (`AppxProvider.dll`, `AssocProvider.dll`, `CbsProvider.dll`) after they are loaded. \n   - While deletion of temporary files is common, the **correlation between `DismHost.exe` loading and `Dism.exe` deleting these files** raises questions about whether the DLLs were used for a transient, potentially malicious purpose (e.g., code injection or execution).\n\n3. **Temporary Directory Usage:**\n   - The use of a **GUID-named temporary folder** (`33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`) is a common tactic in malware to obscure activity. Legitimate tools typically use more predictable or system-specific paths.\n\n4. **Provider-Specific DLLs:**\n   - The DLL names (e.g., `TransmogProvider.dll`, `SetupPlatformProvider.dll`) suggest they may be **custom or third-party modules**. While DISM can use plugins, the lack of context about these providers (e.g., their origin, purpose, or signing) is concerning.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):\n- **Unusual DLL Loading Patterns:** The volume and diversity of DLLs loaded by `DismHost.exe` deviate from typical DISM behavior.\n- **Post-Execution Cleanup:** The deletion of DLLs by `Dism.exe` could be an attempt to erase evidence of transient malicious activity.\n- **Lack of Contextual Information:** No logs indicate why these DLLs were loaded, their source, or their purpose, which is inconsistent with legitimate administrative tasks.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Investigate the Source of DLLs:** Check if the DLLs are signed by trusted entities or if they match known malicious hashes.\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Look for additional events (e.g., network activity, registry changes) that might contextualize the DLL loading\/deletion.\n- **Monitor DISM Usage:** Ensure that `DismHost.exe` and `Dism.exe` are being used in expected ways (e.g., by administrators during image deployment).\n- **Check for Malware Signatures:** Use tools like VirusTotal or endpoint detection systems to analyze the DLLs for malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to the unusual combination of **uncharacteristic DLL loading, post-execution cleanup, and use of a temporary directory**. While not definitively malicious, these patterns align with tactics used by malware and warrant further analysis to rule out compromise. \n\n**Classification:** **High Priority - Suspicious Activity**  \n**Action Required:** Forensic analysis of the DLLs, correlation with other logs, and monitoring of DISM-related processes."}

All of them have the process 'Dism.exe' and a task 'File Delete logged' with different DLL files being deleted from the Temp directory.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is suspicious. Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. However, deleting multiple files from the Temp folder might not be inherently malicious. But wait, the files being deleted are all DLLs with names like FfuProvider.dll, FolderProvider.dll, etc. These names seem a bit generic, but they could be part of a legitimate installation or update process.\n\nHowever, the fact that so many files are being deleted by Dism.exe in a short period might be unusual. Typically, Dism is used for things like applying updates or mounting WIM images. If this is part of a normal system update, it might be okay. But if these files were downloaded from an untrusted source or if there's no corresponding installation activity, that could be a red flag.\n\nAlso, the Temp directory is a common place for malware to store temporary files.

It can delete temporary files during operations like applying updates or mounting WIM images.\n\n2. **Unusual Volume of Deletions**: The deletion of **16+ DLL files** in quick succession from the Temp directory is atypical for normal Dism operations. This could indicate:\n   - **Legitimate cleanup** during a large-scale system update\/imaging task.\n   - **Malicious activity** (e.g., deletion of evidence, if the files were temporarily placed by malware).\n\n3. **File Naming Pattern**: The DLLs (e.g., `FfuProvider.dll`, `TransmogProvider.dll`) have generic names that could align with legitimate Windows components or third-party tools. However, the lack of context (e.g., no corresponding file creation events, no user interaction) makes it harder to confirm legitimacy.\n\n4. **No Clear Triggering Event**: The logs only show deletions, not the preceding file creation or execution of the DLLs.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries that look like they're from a Windows event log, probably from something like Sysmon or another monitoring tool. The main thing I notice is that there are several entries where the process is \"powershell.exe\" and the command line includes creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\" in the \"unidade_logico\" directory. \n\nFirst, I should check if creating a new service via PowerShell is a normal or suspicious activity. Normally, services are created through the Services management console or using commands like sc.exe or New-Service. However, using PowerShell to create a service might be part of legitimate administrative tasks, but it can also be a sign of malicious activity, especially if the service points to an unusual location or executable.\n\nLooking at the path \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\", this doesn't look like a standard system directory. Windows typically has system files in \"C:\\Windows\\System32\" or other known directories. The presence of \"unidade_logico\" and \"registro_comum\" suggests it might be a custom or non-standard directory, which could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. Maybe it's part of an application that's installed in a custom location.\n\nThe fact that the service is being started immediately after creation with Start-Service could indicate that the attacker is trying to get the service running as soon as possible, which is common in malware to maintain persistence. The service name \"objeto_ativo\" translates to \"active object\" in Portuguese, which might be a hint towards the purpose, but I'm not sure. It could be a benign service, but the location and the method of creation make me cautious.\n\nI should also check if there are other entries in the logs that might indicate further malicious activity. For example, if there are other processes or file accesses related to \"tarefa_logico.exe\" or the \"unidade_logico\" directory, that would be a concern. However, looking at the provided data, the only other entries are about standard system processes like services.exe, sppsvc.exe, and svchost.exe, which are normal. But there are also some entries with \"None\" for process and file, which might be incomplete logs or non-process-related events.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the use of PowerShell for creating services. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, using it in this way can be a sign of someone trying to avoid detection, especially if they're using obfuscation or other techniques. However, the command line here is relatively straightforward, just using New-Service and Start-Service. It's not highly obfuscated, which might mean it's a legitimate script, but again, the location of the executable is suspicious.\n\nI should also think about the \"winlog\" field. The task is listed as \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" in some entries. I'm not exactly sure what those mean, but they might be specific to the logging tool being used. If these are from a security tool, then the \"Provider Lifecycle\" might indicate that the tool is tracking the lifecycle of the service or some other provider, which could be normal.\n\nIn summary, the main concerns here are:\n1. The creation of a new service using PowerShell with a non-standard path.\n2. The immediate starting of the service after creation, which could be for persistence.\n3. The location of the executable not being a standard system directory.\n\nHowever, without more context or additional log entries, it's hard to definitively say if this is malicious or not. It could be a legitimate process, especially if the user is managing services on their own system. But given the information provided, it's worth investigating further to ensure that the service isn't part of a malicious payload.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided JSON entries represent a series of Windows event logs, likely generated by a monitoring tool like Sysmon. Here's an analysis of the key points and potential implications:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Service Creation via PowerShell**:\n   - A PowerShell script is used to create a new service named **`objeto_ativo`** (translated to \"active object\" in Portuguese) with the executable **`tarefa_logico.exe`** located in a non-standard directory:  \n     ```\n     C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\n     ```\n   - The script then immediately starts the service using `Start-Service`.\n\n2. **Suspicious Indicators**:\n   - **Non-Standard Path**: The executable is in a directory named `unidade_logico` (possibly \"logical unit\"), which is not a typical Windows system or application directory. This could indicate a custom or non-legitimate installation.\n   - **Immediate Execution**: The service is started right after creation, which is common in malware to ensure persistence.\n   - **Use of PowerShell**: While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use for creating and starting services can be a red flag, especially if obfuscation or unusual behavior is involved (though the script here is relatively straightforward).\n\n3. **Other Log Entries**:\n   - Entries for standard system processes (`services.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `svchost.exe`) are normal.\n   - Some logs have `None` for process\/file, which may indicate incomplete data or non-process-related events.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks**\n- **Malware Persistence**: The creation of a service with a non-standard executable could be a method for malware to persist on the system.\n- **Untrusted Executable**: The `tarefa_logico.exe` file in a non-standard location may be malicious, especially if it is not signed or if its behavior is uncharacteristic.\n- **Lack of Context**: Without additional logs (e.g., file access, network activity, or process behavior), it is difficult to confirm whether this is benign or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Executable**:\n   - Analyze the `tarefa_logico.exe` file using tools like **VirusTotal**, **PE Viewer**, or **sandboxing** to check for malicious behavior.\n   - Verify if the file is signed by a trusted publisher.\n\n2. **Check for Additional Logs**:\n   - Look for other events related to the service (e.g., file access, network connections, or registry changes).\n   - Monitor the behavior of `tarefa_logico.exe` in real time using process monitoring tools.\n\n3. **Review System Integrity**:\n   - Use tools like **Malwarebytes**, **Windows Defender**, or **Sysmon** to scan for threats.\n   - Check the system's integrity using **Windows System File Checker** (`sfc \/scannow`).\n\n4. **Verify Legitimacy**:\n   - If the service is part of a legitimate application, ensure it is properly documented and installed in a trusted location.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the activity could be legitimate (e.g., a custom application managing a service), the **non-standard path** and **immediate execution** raise concerns. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a benign process or a potential security threat. If the executable is untrusted or behaves suspiciously, it should be removed and the system scanned for malware."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look at these logs. The first event stands out because it's using PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to an executable in a directory that seems suspicious: \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\". Creating a service with a custom executable isn't normal unless it's part of a legitimate setup. The other events are all running PowerShell commands with \"Write-Host\" that output simple results like 'Final result: 1' or checking INF files. Those seem benign, maybe part of a script testing or validation process. However, the first event is a red flag because creating a service with a non-standard path could be an indicator of malicious activity, like hiding malware. Even though the other events don't show obvious threats, the presence of that first event makes the batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence is around 0.7 because while the first event is suspicious, more context would be needed to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The first event shows PowerShell creating a new service with a suspicious binary path in a non-standard directory, which could indicate potential malware installation. Other events are benign but do not counteract the initial suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are five events here. The first two events are about a PowerShell command being executed. The command line looks a bit suspicious. Let me parse it.\n\nThe PowerShell script is checking for INF files in the Windows directory's inf folder. It's looking for sections that match [defaultinstall.nt followed by architecture types like amd64, arm, etc. The script sets a result variable to 1 if it finds any of those sections. The purpose here might be to detect if there are any installation INF files that are set up for different architectures. But why would that be suspicious?\n\nWell, INF files are typically used for installing drivers or software. If an attacker is trying to install malicious drivers, they might use INF files. The script is scanning for these files, which could be part of a larger attack chain where the attacker is checking for existing drivers or trying to inject their own. However, just scanning for INF files isn't necessarily malicious. But the fact that this is done via PowerShell with Restricted ExecutionPolicy might be a red flag. Wait, the ExecutionPolicy is set to Restricted, which usually prevents scripts from running. But the command is still executed, so maybe the user is bypassing that somehow.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a Security Group Management task, a Logon task with services.exe, and a Special Logon. These seem normal. Services.exe is a legitimate process related to Windows services. The Security Group Management could be part of normal system operations, like managing user groups during logon.\n\nBut the first two events are the same. The PowerShell command is being run twice. Maybe it's a repeated check. However, the script itself is just searching for INF files. Unless it's part of a larger attack, like checking for existing drivers to replace them or to find a way to install malicious ones. But without more context, like the script actually modifying files or executing other malicious commands, it's hard to say.\n\nThe justification here is that the PowerShell script is scanning for INF files with specific sections, which could indicate an attempt to detect or exploit driver installation processes. However, without additional malicious actions (like modifying files, connecting to external IPs, etc.), it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6. It's not a clear-cut attack, but it's suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The same PowerShell command is executed twice, scanning INF files for architecture-specific sections. This may indicate an attempt to detect or exploit driver installation mechanisms, which could be part of a larger malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
