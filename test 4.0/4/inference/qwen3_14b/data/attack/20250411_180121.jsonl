{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for any suspicious activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's chrome.exe with several network connections and DNS queries. Chrome doing a lot of network activity isn't necessarily bad, but if it's excessive or to unusual domains, that could be a red flag. However, the logs don't mention any specific domains or IP addresses, just the task names. So maybe not immediately suspicious, but worth noting.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, but it's also a common vector for attacks. Let me check the events related to PowerShell. There's a process create event where the command line shows a WebClient downloading a file from a GitHub raw URL. The URLs mentioned are from repositories like \"objeto_base\/objeto_comum\" and others. Downloading files from GitHub isn't inherently malicious, but the fact that it's done via PowerShell might be. However, the files downloaded are LICENSE.txt, which are typically benign. Still, the use of PowerShell to download files could be part of a larger attack, especially if combined with other suspicious activities.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple image load events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET DLLs, which is normal. However, the presence of \"MpOAV.dll\" from Windows Defender might be a red flag. Wait, MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender's real-time protection. If that's being loaded, it's probably legitimate. But maybe the context here is different. However, the other DLLs like mscorее.dll and clr.dll are part of the .NET framework, which is standard for PowerShell.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script, which is common for temporary operations. But the fact that it's created and deleted quickly might be part of a script that's executing and then cleaning up. However, without seeing the content of the script, it's hard to tell. The names of the files are generic, like \"modulo_padrao.txt\" or \"tarefa_auxiliar.txt,\" which don't immediately scream malware.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repeated use of NetworkConnect events for chrome.exe. If chrome is making many network connections, that could be normal if the user is browsing, but if it's part of a botnet or data exfiltration, that's bad. However, without more context on the destination IPs or domains, it's hard to say. The same goes for the DNS queries.\n\nThe PowerShell events include a Registry value set, which could be modifying settings, but again, without knowing what's being changed, it's hard to assess. The ImageLoad events are normal for PowerShell running scripts.\n\nPutting this all together, the most suspicious part is the PowerShell downloading files from GitHub. However, since the files are LICENSE.txt and the URLs are from public repositories, it's possible that this is just a legitimate script downloading license information. The other events, like network connections and image loads, are typical for normal operations. The file creation and deletion in Temp is common for scripts. However, the repeated use of PowerShell in this way might be part of a larger pattern, but without more evidence like unusual commands, unexpected network destinations, or other malicious activities, it's not conclusive. \n\nBut wait, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes with different command lines downloading different files from GitHub might be a sign of automated scripts or even a potential attack. However, since the files are from public repositories, it's possible they are legitimate. The key here is that the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. Since there are multiple PowerShell events with network activity and file downloads, even if they seem benign, they could be part of something more. However, given the information available, it's not strong enough to flag as a clear threat. But maybe the fact that there are multiple such events could be considered suspicious. Alternatively, the system might be using PowerShell for legitimate administrative tasks.\n\nHmm. I think the main point here is that while there are some suspicious elements, they might not be enough to conclude a security incident. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell-related events with network activity and file downloads could warrant further investigation to ensure that these are indeed legitimate activities and not part of a larger attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several activities that could be considered **suspicious** and warrant further investigation, though they are not definitively malicious. Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n### 1. **PowerShell Network Activity**\n   - **Multiple `WebClient.DownloadFile` commands** are observed, downloading files from GitHub repositories (e.g., `raw.githubusercontent.com`). While downloading files from public repositories is not inherently malicious, the repetition of such actions and the use of PowerShell for this purpose could indicate:\n     - **Automated scripting** (e.g., for legitimate purposes like configuration management).\n     - **Potential exfiltration** or **data collection** if the files being downloaded are not benign (though the filenames like `LICENSE.txt` suggest they may be innocuous in this case).\n\n### 2. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory**\n   - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1`) is created in the Temp directory and immediately deleted. This pattern is common in:\n     - **Malware execution** (to avoid leaving traces).\n     - **Legitimate temporary operations** (e.g., script execution or testing).\n   - Without inspecting the script content, it is ambiguous whether this is benign or malicious.\n\n### 3. **Repetitive Network Connections and DNS Queries**\n   - **Chrome.exe** is associated with multiple `NetworkConnect` and `DNSQuery` events. While Chrome may legitimately perform such actions during browsing, the volume or destination of these connections (not specified here) could be a red flag if:\n     - The destinations are **unusual**, **malicious**, or **unrelated to user activity**.\n\n### 4. **Image Load Events for PowerShell**\n   - PowerShell is loading standard .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscorlib.dll`, `System.dll`). This is normal behavior for PowerShell execution. However, the presence of **Windows Defender-related DLLs** (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`) could be coincidental or could indicate **antivirus evasion techniques** (if the script is attempting to interfere with security software).\n\n### 5. **Registry Modifications**\n   - A `Registry value set` event is logged. While registry changes are common in system configurations, this could also be part of **malware persistence** or **configuration tampering** if the changes are not documented or justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Interesting for Investigation**\n- **Yes**, this batch of events is **interesting** and should be investigated further. The combination of:\n  - **PowerShell-based network activity** (even if downloading `LICENSE.txt` files),\n  - **File creation\/deletion in Temp directories**, and\n  - **Repetitive network connections**,\n  could indicate:\n  - **Legitimate administrative tasks** (e.g., script-based automation).\n  - **Malicious activity** (e.g., data exfiltration, lateral movement, or initial compromise).\n- **Next Steps**:\n  - **Analyze the content of downloaded files** (if possible) to confirm their legitimacy.\n  - **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., firewall logs, process tree, user activity) to determine the context of the network connections.\n  - **Check for anomalies** in the timing, volume, or destinations of network traffic.\n\nWhile not definitively malicious, the events suggest **potential security concerns** that merit closer scrutiny."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several PowerShell processes that are downloading files from GitHub using WebClient.DownloadFile. The URLs are all from raw.githubusercontent.com, which is common for hosting text files like LICENSE.txt. However, the fact that multiple downloads are happening from different repositories might be suspicious. The file paths are in the TEMP directory, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files. But just downloading a LICENSE.txt isn't necessarily malicious, though it's a bit odd because those files are usually benign.\n\nThen there's a file creation event for 'elemento_padrao.txt' in the Downloads folder. Not sure if that's relevant yet. The chrome.exe processes have multiple registry value set events. That could be normal, but if there's a lot of them, maybe something's changing registry settings. However, the user didn't mention any unusual behavior from Chrome here.\n\nAnother PowerShell event mentions an image loaded from Defender's MpClient.dll. That's a legitimate file, so probably not an issue. There's also a file creation in the StartupProfileData folder, which might be related to PowerShell profiles. The registry events for conhost.exe and others might be normal too.\n\nThe Dns query event is just a normal DNS lookup. The winlogbeat file creation is part of installing or configuring a log shipper, which is a legitimate activity.\n\nPutting this all together: the main suspicious part is the multiple PowerShell commands downloading files from GitHub. Even though they're downloading LICENSE.txt, which is usually harmless, the pattern of multiple such downloads from different repositories might indicate an attempt to execute scripts or download payloads. However, without more context like execution of the downloaded files or other malicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. The presence of multiple downloads and the use of PowerShell with WebClient could be a red flag. But since all the files are from GitHub and are named as LICENSE.txt, which are typically benign, it's possible that this is just a legitimate activity. However, the repetition and the use of temporary directories might still be worth investigating further. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence because it's not conclusive but shows potential suspicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are downloading files from GitHub repositories using WebClient.DownloadFile, which is a common technique for payload delivery.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file in the Downloads folder. That's common, maybe user activity. Then MpDefenderCoreService.exe has a network connection detected. That could be normal, but maybe worth noting. Next, winlogbeat.exe created a file in its data directory. That seems like part of its normal operation, maybe configuring settings.\n\nThen there are several registry events and process accesses by powershell.exe. Multiple instances of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent might indicate some automation or script running. The calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal, as that's a standard DLL. \n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe command, which is often used in scripts to get user info. Then a cmd.exe command trying to delete a scheduled task named 'spawn' with \/F. Deleting a task might be suspicious if it's part of a cleanup after an attack. The schtasks.exe process is involved here, which is used to manage scheduled tasks. \n\nAnother event shows cmd.exe modifying the registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms. The repeated ProcessAccess events by powershell.exe might indicate ongoing activity. \n\nPutting this together: the deletion of a scheduled task named 'spawn' is a red flag. Scheduled tasks are often used by attackers to maintain persistence. The use of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe to delete the task suggests someone is trying to remove traces. The multiple registry modifications and process accesses by powershell could be part of a larger attack. \n\nHowever, some events might be benign, like winlogbeat creating files. But the combination of deleting a scheduled task, registry changes, and multiple process accesses points towards potential malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because some events are normal, but the overall pattern is suspicious enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell creating files, registry modifications, process access attempts, and deletion of a scheduled task named 'spawn' via SCHTASKS, which may indicate persistence mechanism cleanup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are multiple entries involving powershell.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe, and conhost.exe. The tasks mentioned are things like Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, and Registry object added or deleted. \n\nHmm, some of the command lines stand out. For example, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes a registry key: \"REG DELETE HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run \/V \"modulo_temporario\" \/f >nul 2>&1\". That looks like someone is trying to remove a registry entry, possibly to hide something. Another entry uses reg.exe to delete another registry value called \"pacote_auxiliar\". \n\nAlso, there are several instances where powershell.exe is accessed or used to set registry values. The presence of multiple registry deletions and modifications might indicate an attempt to alter system settings or remove traces of malicious activity. \n\nI should check if there's any suspicious activity. The use of \"whoami.exe\" is normal, but the combination with other commands might be part of a larger attack. The repeated use of powershell.exe with registry events could be part of a script trying to modify system configurations. \n\nAdditionally, there are entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks, which might be related to event logging, but they don't seem directly malicious. However, the deletion of registry keys under Run is suspicious because that's where startup programs are stored. Removing them could be an attempt to prevent persistence or hide malicious software.\n\nThe confidence level depends on how likely these events are part of an attack. Since there are multiple registry modifications and deletions, along with powershell usage, which is often used in attacks, this seems suspicious. However, without more context, it's not definitive.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to various DLLs, some of which are part of the .NET framework, like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. Those seem legitimate because they're standard .NET components. But then there's one that's pointing to MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a bit more suspicious because it's a security-related DLL. However, Windows Defender might load that under normal circumstances, so maybe not a red flag on its own.\n\nNext, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest... That could be part of a legitimate process, like a script testing or policy check. But the fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might be a sign of something trying to execute a script without leaving traces. However, that's not definitive yet.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, but no file involved. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but if there's a lot of them or in unusual contexts, it might be a concern. But here, it's just one event.\n\nThen there are several Process accessed events and Registry value set events. The Process accessed events might indicate that another process is interacting with PowerShell, which could be normal or could be a sign of compromise. The Registry changes could be part of configuration changes, but again, without knowing the specific keys, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a 'powershell.exe & {}' which is an empty script block. That might be a placeholder or a test. The whoami.exe and cmd.exe processes are standard, so unless they're doing something unusual, they might not be a problem.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: multiple image loads from PowerShell, a temporary script created and deleted, and some registry and process access events. However, many of these could be part of normal operations, especially if PowerShell is being used for legitimate administrative tasks. The presence of Windows Defender DLLs might be normal, but if there's a pattern of unusual activity, that's different.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the batch is interesting. The events don't show a clear malicious pattern. The script creation and deletion could be benign, like a temporary file. The image loads are standard. The registry changes are not specific enough to indicate a problem. The confidence here is a bit low because without more context, like unusual command lines, unexpected network activity, or other indicators, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell events and some suspicious file operations might warrant further investigation. But since the justification needs to be concise, I should weigh if the events are enough to be classified as interesting. Maybe it's on the edge, but the presence of the temporary script and the multiple image loads could be a sign of something. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the confidence should be around 0.6, as there's some suspicious activity but not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes loading .NET DLLs and creating\/deleting temporary scripts may indicate script-based activity.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of activity around powershell.exe. That's a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. There are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessing processes, modifying registry values, and loading images like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. Those are normal for PowerShell, but the frequency might be a red flag.\n\nThen there's the creation and deletion of a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. That's a common place for malware to store temporary files. The fact that a file is created and then deleted could be an attempt to hide activity, which is suspicious.\n\nAlso, the command line for some processes is \"powershell.exe & {}\", which seems odd. The empty script block might be a way to bypass certain security checks or indicate an attempt to execute a script without leaving obvious traces. \n\nOther processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and ApplicationFrameHost.exe are also involved, but their activities are less suspicious on their own. However, combined with the PowerShell events, it might indicate a larger pattern.\n\nThe repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with the same command line might be normal, but in combination with other events, they could be part of a larger attack. The loading of specific DLLs from .NET Framework is normal for PowerShell, but if there's unexpected behavior around those, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nI should also check if there are any indicators of compromise (IoCs) like unusual file paths, unexpected network activity, or privilege escalation. However, in the given data, the main suspicious points are the PowerShell activities, the temporary file, and the command line usage.\n\nConsidering all these points, the combination of multiple PowerShell events, registry changes, and file creation\/deletion in temp directories suggests potential malicious activity.

The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Pipe Created, Process accessed, Image loaded, and File created. The files mentioned are mostly from system directories, like Windows Defender's MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll, which are legitimate system files. \n\nLooking at the powershell.exe entries, there are multiple instances where it's performing actions like setting registry values, creating pipes, accessing processes, and loading images. One entry has a command line that removes a file named objeto_principal.zip from the TEMP directory. Another has a command line with \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item...}\". That seems suspicious because removing a file, especially from TEMP, might be part of cleaning up after an attack. However, without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious. \n\nThe presence of whoami.exe is normal; it's a standard tool for checking user identity. The ImageLoad events point to legitimate system DLLs, so that's probably not a threat. \n\nBut there's a lot of activity around powershell.exe, which is often used in attacks.

That's under AppData, which is a common place for user-specific data. But creating a file there might not be suspicious on its own. However, the next few events show multiple registry value sets and process accesses by powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially when modifying the registry or accessing processes.\n\nThen there's the whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate tool for checking user identity, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack. The next events involve removing temporary files like tarefa_base.txt and estrutura_ativo.txt. Deleting files could be part of cleaning up after an attack, which is concerning.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, PowerShell is loading several .NET DLLs. While these are legitimate, the presence of multiple image loads might indicate that PowerShell is being used to execute scripts or payloads. The temporary file creation and deletion (like __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1) could be part of script execution that's trying to bypass security policies.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of PowerShell for various tasks, including registry modifications, process access, and file operations. This pattern is often seen in attacks where adversaries use PowerShell to maintain persistence, execute commands, or evade detection. The combination of these events suggests that there's an attempt to manipulate the system, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these activities could be legitimate. For example, PowerShell is a common administrative tool, and registry edits can be part of normal operations. But the frequency and combination of events—especially the file creation and deletion in temporary directories, along with image loads of .NET components—raise suspicion. The presence of multiple registry changes and process accesses without clear legitimate context makes this batch more likely to be interesting for investigation.\n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say around 0.75.

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each event and see what's happening. Let's start with the first few entries. There are several PowerShell commands that are removing files from the TEMP directory. The commands are using Remove-Item with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore. That's a bit suspicious because normally, deleting files might be part of normal operations, but doing it multiple times with those parameters could be an attempt to clean up evidence. The files being deleted have names like registro_auxiliar.txt, registro_comum.txt, etc. These might be temporary files, but the fact that they're being deleted in multiple events could indicate something.\n\nNext, there's an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal, but I need to check if there's anything unusual about the path or the action. The file path seems standard, though.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell process loading a DLL from Windows Defender. That's probably legitimate, as Defender's components are part of the OS. The ImageLoad event here might not be a threat.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple FileCreate events for PowerShell, some in the AppData directory. Creating a StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file might be part of normal PowerShell usage, but again, the repetition could be a red flag. Also, there's a FileCreate event for objeto_padrao.txt in the Downloads folder. Not sure yet if that's benign or not.\n\nRegistry value set events for chrome.exe and others. Chrome modifying registry values is normal, but if it's doing it repeatedly, maybe there's something else going on. However, multiple entries here might just be normal operations.\n\nThere's also a ProcessAccess event for PowerShell and conhost.exe. ProcessAccess can be part of normal operations, but if it's being accessed in a way that's unexpected, that could be a sign of malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe whoami.exe commands are straightforward—they just output the user's identity. Those are likely part of normal scripts or checks.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The repeated deletion of files from TEMP using PowerShell might be an attempt to remove logs or other evidence. However, the other events don't seem to show signs of malicious activity. The presence of legitimate processes like winlogbeat and Chrome, along with standard system tools like whoami, suggests that some of these events are normal. But the multiple deletions could be part of a larger pattern. However, without more indicators like network activity, unusual file creations, or unexpected process executions, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. The confidence here would be moderate—maybe around 0.6. The justification would be the repeated deletion of files with specific names and the use of PowerShell with Force and ErrorAction Ignore, which could be indicative of cleanup activities. But since there's no clear evidence of malware or unauthorized access, it might not be a high priority. However, the repeated nature of the deletions might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are deleting files from the TEMP directory with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore, which may indicate an attempt to clean up evidence.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. So, there are a bunch of entries here. Most of them are about processes being accessed or created, specifically powershell.exe and whoami.exe. The winlog entries mention ProcessAccess and ProcessCreate rules. \n\nHmm, I notice that whoami.exe is being executed multiple times with the same command line. That's normal because whoami is a standard Windows tool that displays the current user's identity. But then there's also a lot of ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities. However, just seeing ProcessAccess events alone isn't necessarily suspicious. \n\nWait, there's one event where winlogbeat.exe created a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation. But then there's another event where powershell.exe created a file named \"pacote_ativo.txt\" in the Downloads directory. That file name is in Portuguese, which might be a red flag. Also, the path is in the Downloads folder, which is common for user downloads but could be a place where malicious files are stored. \n\nHowever, I need to check if there are any other signs of malicious activity. The events don't mention any network connections, registry changes, or other suspicious processes. The repetition of whoami and powershell might be normal, but the creation of a file by powershell in the Downloads directory could be worth investigating. \n\nBut wait, the user might be downloading a file named \"pacote_ativo.txt\" which could be benign, like a text file. Without more context, like the content of the file or other events, it's hard to say. However, the presence of that file creation event along with multiple ProcessAccess events for PowerShell might indicate something. But I'm not sure if that's enough to classify this as interesting. \n\nAnother thing to consider: the classification should be based on the combination of all events. The majority of events are normal processes, but the one file creation by PowerShell might be a low-risk indicator. However, since the user is asking for a classification based on the entire batch, maybe the repetition of events and the presence of that specific file name are enough to flag it as interesting. \n\nBut I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the confidence should be moderate. The justification would be the creation of the \"pacote_ativo.txt\" file by PowerShell, but without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the repeated ProcessAccess events could be normal, especially if the system is under heavy use. \n\nI think the key point is the file creation by PowerShell. Since the other events are standard, but that one file might be a sign of something. So, I'll classify it as INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process access events for powershell.exe combined with a file creation event for 'pacote_ativo.txt' (a potentially suspicious filename in Portuguese) in the Downloads directory suggest possible malicious activity, though not definitively confirmed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
