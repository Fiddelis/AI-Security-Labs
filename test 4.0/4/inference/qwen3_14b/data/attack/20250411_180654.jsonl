{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. Some entries mention file creation, like 'objeto_temporario.txt' being created. But that's just a regular file. Then there's a command line that runs a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a red flag. That script is commonly used in malware to log keystrokes. The paths mentioned are a bit odd, like C:\\tarefa_base\\tarefa_geral\\... which might be obfuscated or part of a malicious setup. \n\nAlso, there are multiple registry value sets by chrome.exe. While chrome can modify the registry, doing it repeatedly might indicate something's wrong. But the main issue here is the PowerShell scripts. The fact that they're loading .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll and clr.dll could be part of a legitimate process, but combined with the keystroke logging, it's suspicious.\n\nThe 'Provider Lifecycle' events might be normal, but the overall pattern of PowerShell executing scripts that capture keystrokes and loading various DLLs points towards a potential security threat. Even though some entries are normal, the presence of keystroke logging scripts is a strong indicator of malicious activity. So, I think this batch is interesting and needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute keystroke logging scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) and load suspicious .NET assemblies, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple process events where PowerShell is executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The command line parameters are similar each time, with the script path varying but all pointing to different directories. The log path is set to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That seems suspicious because keystroke logging is a common technique used by malware to capture sensitive information like passwords.\n\nNow, there are also events related to file creation and deletion. For example, a temporary file is created and then deleted, which might be part of a script's normal operation, but combined with the keystroke logging, it could be a red flag. The fact that the same script is being called from various paths might indicate that the attacker is trying to obfuscate the origin of the malicious script.\n\nAnother thing to note is the presence of multiple entries with the task 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These might be related to the execution of the PowerShell scripts. Also, there are events where PowerShell is loading images, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. However, the presence of these might be normal, but when combined with the keystroke logging, it could be a sign of something malicious trying to evade detection.\n\nThe event with the task 'Execute a Remote Command' and the file path pointing to another Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script is another red flag. This suggests that the script might be part of a larger attack, possibly executed remotely, which is a common tactic in cyber attacks.\n\nI should also check for any patterns or repeated activities. The repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths and the consistent use of the $env:TEMP\\key.log as the log path indicate a possible attempt to log keystrokes on the system. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity.\n\nHowever, there are also some normal system events, like file creation by winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe. These might be part of legitimate processes, but their presence doesn't negate the suspicious activities observed.\n\nConsidering all these points, the repeated execution of the keystroke logging script from various locations, combined with file operations that could be part of evading detection, points towards a potential security threat. The confidence level is high because the indicators of compromise are clear and consistent across multiple events.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts from different paths, all logging keystrokes to $env:TEMP\\\\key.log, indicating potential keystroke logging malware. This is combined with file creation\/deletion events and remote command execution indicators.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch of logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. The first event is about svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization directory. I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate system process that hosts various Windows services. The file path mentioned is part of the DeliveryOptimization service, which is used for Windows Update and other system functions. The file name keyValueLKG.dat doesn't ring any bells as something malicious. So this seems normal.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool used for collecting and forwarding logs. The file path here is a .yml.new file, which might be part of a configuration setup. Since the user is in the Downloads folder, it's possible they're installing or configuring Winlogbeat. This doesn't look suspicious either.\n\nThe third event is about powershell.exe creating a text file in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is a common tool used for both legitimate and malicious activities. However, the file created here is a simple text file named entrada_padrao.txt. There's no indication of malicious activity here, like downloading payloads or executing scripts. It's just a regular file creation.\n\nNow, looking at all three events together. None of them show signs of unusual activity. The processes involved are all legitimate, and the file creations are in expected locations. There's no pattern that suggests a security threat, like multiple suspicious files being created, unusual process combinations, or access to sensitive areas of the system. The confidence here is low because there's nothing out of the ordinary. So the classification should be NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) creating files in expected locations (system directories, user Downloads folder) with no suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.1\n}"}
