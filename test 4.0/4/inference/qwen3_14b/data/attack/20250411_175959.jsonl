{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then I see powershell.exe entries. Let me check those.\n\nOne of the powershell.exe events has a command line that includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. These commands are typically used to gather information about the system's users, groups, and stored credentials. That seems like reconnaissance activity, which is a red flag. \n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. While loading .NET DLLs might be normal for PowerShell, the presence of MpOAV.dll (from Windows Defender) could be part of legitimate antivirus operations, but combined with the other commands, it might be worth looking into.\n\nAnother event shows a file being created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic used by malware to execute scripts without leaving traces. The file is a PowerShell script, which could be malicious. \n\nAlso, there are multiple Provider Lifecycle events, which might not be significant on their own, but when combined with the other activities, they contribute to a pattern of suspicious behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of PowerShell executing commands to gather system information, creating and deleting a temporary script file, and loading various DLLs could indicate an attempt to explore the system or execute malicious code. Even though some activities are normal, the overall pattern is concerning. The confidence isn't 100% because some elements are legitimate, but the combination of these events makes it interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing commands to gather system information (net user, get-localgroup), creating\/deleting temporary script files, and loading potentially malicious DLLs. Combined with frequent network activity, this suggests potential reconnaissance or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries with the same process command line: powershell.exe running a series of commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, net localgroup. These commands are all about enumerating user accounts, groups, and checking stored credentials. That's suspicious because it looks like information gathering, which is often part of a reconnaissance phase in an attack.\n\nThen there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which might be normal if it's part of log collection, but not sure yet. The other entries include powershell.exe creating a file called pacote_ativo.txt. That's a Portuguese term meaning \"active package,\" which could be a red flag if it's related to malicious activity. Also, there's a chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times. While Chrome might do that for updates or extensions, repeated registry changes could indicate something malicious, but maybe not as directly as the PowerShell commands.\n\nLooking at the tasks: Provider Lifecycle, Pipe Created, File created, Engine Lifecycle, Image loaded, Process Create, Process Access. The PowerShell commands are part of Process Create and Provider Lifecycle tasks. The fact that the same command line is repeated multiple times might indicate that the process is being executed multiple times, which could be an attempt to gather more information or persist.\n\nThe presence of cmdkey.exe \/list is interesting because that's used to list stored credentials, which could be a sign of someone trying to steal credentials. Also, the use of get-childitem and dir on C:\\Users suggests looking through user directories, which might be looking for sensitive files.\n\nThe other entries with chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times might be benign if it's related to user settings, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it's more concerning. The SDXHelper.exe and updater.exe entries are less clear, but the image loaded events might be normal unless they're loading suspicious DLLs, but combase.dll and urlmon.dll are standard Windows components.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated PowerShell commands for enumeration, the use of cmdkey, and the creation of a file named pacote_ativo.txt are suspicious. Even though some events might be normal, the combination of these activities points towards potential malicious behavior, like reconnaissance or credential harvesting. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious command-line scripts that enumerate user accounts, groups, stored credentials, and system files (e.g., 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', 'ls C:\/Users'). This pattern is commonly associated with reconnaissance activities in cyberattacks. Additionally, a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' is created, which may indicate data exfiltration or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a process called updater.exe from Google, which seems legitimate. But then there's a cmdkey.exe listing credentials, which could be a red flag if it's being used to extract stored passwords. Next, there's a powershell.exe process that runs a series of commands like net user, get-localuser, and ls C:\/Users. That looks suspicious because it's enumerating users and directories, which is typical of an attacker gathering information.\n\nThen there are multiple entries under Security Group Management and User Account Management, which might indicate changes to permissions or user accounts. The SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll could be normal, but sometimes these DLLs are used in attacks. The PowerShell creating a file in the AppData directory and setting a registry value might be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context like unexpected network activity or unauthorized access, it's a bit hard to tell. But the combination of process creation, credential listing, and system enumeration does raise some flags. I'd say this is interesting but not certain, so a confidence around 0.65.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: credential enumeration via cmdkey.exe, PowerShell-based system reconnaissance (user\/group listing, file\/dir access), and potential persistence attempts (registry modification, file creation).

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But the file path has .yml.new, which could be a temporary file. Not too suspicious yet.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. SDXHelper isn't a standard Windows process. Loading urlmon.dll is normal for some tasks, but if it's from an unexpected location or part of a larger pattern, that could be an indicator of something malicious. But just one event isn't enough to say for sure.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe creating modulo_base.txt. Creating a text file isn't inherently bad, but if it's part of a larger activity, like downloading or executing scripts, that might be a concern. However, alone, it's not a red flag.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe running with the command line that includes \/installsource scheduler. That seems legitimate as part of an update process. Maybe the scheduler is just triggering an update. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nTwo svchost.exe entries with registry value changes. svchost is a normal host process for Windows services. Registry changes could be part of normal operations, but multiple entries might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's part of Task Scheduler, which is normal. But again, depends on the context.\n\nbackgroundTaskHost.exe loading urlmon.dll again. backgroundTaskHost is related to background tasks in Windows, so this might be normal. But again, if this is part of a larger pattern of unexpected DLLs, that's a problem.\n\nThen, winlogbeat.exe creating the same file again. Maybe a duplicate event? Could be a mistake in the log, or maybe a repeated action. Not sure yet.\n\nPowerShell.exe accessing the registry and having process access. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a normal tool. The registry access might be benign, but if combined with other events, it could be a sign.\n\nLooking at all events together, there's a mix of normal processes and some that might be benign. The SDXHelper.exe and the multiple PowerShell activities could be points of interest, but they're not definitive. The fact that winlogbeat is creating a .yml.new file twice might be normal for configuration updates. However, the presence of SDXHelper.exe, which isn't a standard process, and the repeated registry changes might indicate some activity worth looking into. But I'm not 100% confident. Maybe the confidence is around 0.6. It's not a clear-cut malicious activity, but there are enough anomalies to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities observed: non-standard process SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll, PowerShell creating files and accessing registry, and repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe.
