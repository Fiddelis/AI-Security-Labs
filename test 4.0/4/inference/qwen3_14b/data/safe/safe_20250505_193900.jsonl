{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_193900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. The first event is about ShellExperienceHost.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a normal system file, so maybe not suspicious. Then there's svchost.exe setting a registry value, which is common for system processes. The third entry has no process info, which might be a log error or something benign.\n\nNext, Explorer.EXE setting a registry value. That's normal too. Chrome.exe has several events: process creation, pipe creation, registry changes, DNS queries, and loading DLLs. Most of these are typical for Chrome, but the repeated registry value sets might be worth noting. However, looking at the DLLs loaded, like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, those are legitimate Windows Defender files. \n\nThen there's WmiPrvSE.exe, which is part of Windows Management Instrumentation. The command line includes -secured and -Embedding, which could be normal or potentially suspicious if it's part of a malicious process. However, the loaded DLL (wmiutils.dll) is a legitimate system file.\n\nThe svchost.exe instances are part of normal system services. The services.exe logon event is standard. The repeated registry changes by Chrome might be due to normal operations, like extensions or updates. \n\nOverall, all the processes and activities seem to be related to legitimate system functions and normal user activities. There's no indication of malware or suspicious behavior here. The confidence is low because there's nothing anomalous detected.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events correspond to legitimate system processes (Explorer.EXE, svchost.exe, chrome.exe) and normal operations (DLL loading, registry updates, DNS queries).

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_193900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are about network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. That's normal, right? Chrome often connects to the internet, and svchost.exe is a system process that hosts various services. But there are a few other events that stand out. \n\nLooking at the 10th event, winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a tool for collecting logs, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But then there's the 13th event: updater.exe is running with a command line that includes a URL to clients2.google.com. That seems legitimate because Google's updater would contact their servers. But the command line also has some parameters that might be worth checking. \n\nWait, the 14th event shows chrome.exe loading taskschd.dll from the System32 directory. That's a legitimate system file, so that might not be an issue. However, the 15th event is another Pipe Created event for chrome.exe, which is common but could be part of normal operations.\n\nThe 12th event is the Process Create for updater.exe. The command line includes a database path and a URL. The URL is from Google, which is expected. But I should check if there are any suspicious parameters. The --annotation flags might be normal, but sometimes attackers use similar techniques to hide malicious activity. However, the process is updater.exe from Google, which is a known legitimate software.\n\nAnother thing to note is that chrome.exe is performing several registry value sets and pipe creations. While registry changes can be normal, multiple changes in a short time might indicate something. However, without more context like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe winlogbeat events are about file creation, which is part of its normal operation when setting up configurations. So that's probably not suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the majority of events are from legitimate processes. The updater.exe activity seems normal as part of Google's update process. The chrome.exe activities are typical for a browser. There's no obvious malicious activity here, like unexpected network connections to suspicious IPs, unusual file modifications, or unauthorized process creations. Therefore, this batch might not be interesting for investigation unless there's a specific context or additional events that aren't shown here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show normal process behavior (chrome.exe, svchost.exe, updater.exe) with standard activities like network connections, registry modifications, and file creation. No suspicious indicators such as unexpected network destinations, unauthorized access, or anomalous process interactions detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
