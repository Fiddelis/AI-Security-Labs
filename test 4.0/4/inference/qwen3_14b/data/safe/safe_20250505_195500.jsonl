{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating various JavaScript files in the Office Solution Packages directory. The first thing I notice is that all the files have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min.js with different hash-like suffixes. \n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe... I'm not immediately familiar with that process. Maybe it's part of some software, perhaps related to Microsoft Office? But why is it creating so many minified JS files? Minified files are usually part of web development, but in the context of Office, maybe it's related to some add-in or extension.\n\nWait, the directory path is Office Solution Packages. That makes me think of Office Add-ins, which are often deployed as solutions. But typically, those are .sln files or part of a Visual Studio project. Creating multiple JS files might be part of a build process. However, the repetition here is interesting. There are multiple entries for the same file names, which could indicate that the process is repeatedly creating the same files, maybe due to a loop or error.\n\nBut then again, maybe these are different versions of the same file, each with a unique hash for caching purposes. However, the fact that all the files are in the same directory and have similar names might suggest that they are part of a single deployment or update. \n\nHowever, I should consider the possibility of malicious activity. Sometimes, malware uses legitimate-sounding process names to hide their activities. But SDXHelper.exe isn't a common name for malware, but it's not impossible. The creation of numerous files could be part of data exfiltration or some other malicious activity. However, without more context, like the source of the files or any network activity, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother angle: the files are minified JavaScript. That's normal for web applications, but in an Office environment, maybe this is related to a web part or a SharePoint solution. If this is part of a legitimate deployment, then the repeated creation of these files might be part of a build or deployment pipeline. But if the user didn't initiate this, it could be suspicious.\n\nI should also check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. A quick search in my mind: SDXHelper might be related to some software development tools or Microsoft's own tools. For example, maybe it's part of the Office Developer Tools or something similar. But I'm not 100% sure. If the user is an developer working on Office add-ins, this could be normal. However, if not, then it's worth investigating further.\n\nAnother point is the repetition. The same file is being created multiple times. That might be an error in the process, or maybe it's just logging each creation event. But if the files are being created repeatedly, that could indicate a problem, like an infinite loop in the build process or a script that's not terminating properly.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: the process name (SDXHelper.exe), the location (Office Solution Packages), the nature of the files (minified JS), and the repetition. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but the combination of these factors could be either legitimate or suspicious. The user should check if they're expecting this activity, verify the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe, and ensure that the files being created are part of a known and trusted process.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Provided Logs:**\n\n1. **Process Involved:**\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is the process responsible for creating the JavaScript files. While not a widely known process, it could be associated with software development tools or Microsoft Office-related utilities (e.g., Office Add-in deployment tools).\n\n2. **File Creation Patterns:**\n   - The files are named `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` with unique hash-like suffixes (e.g., `min_0d1ad4f1e67587dbd451127cb72e2305.js`). This naming convention is typical for **minified JavaScript files** used in web applications or add-ins, often for caching or optimization purposes.\n   - **Repetition of the same filenames** suggests either:\n     - A **build\/deployment pipeline** generating multiple versions of the file (e.g., for testing, updates, or caching).\n     - A **potential anomaly** if the process is unintentionally re-creating identical files repeatedly (e.g., due to a loop or error).\n\n3. **Directory Context:**\n   - The files are created in the **Office Solution Packages** directory, which is commonly associated with **Microsoft Office Add-ins** or **SharePoint solutions**. This aligns with the possibility of a legitimate development\/deployment activity.\n\n4. **Legitimacy Considerations:**\n   - **Legitimate Use Case:** If the user is developing or deploying an Office Add-in, this activity could be part of a **normal build process**, where minified files are generated for distribution.\n   - **Suspicious Behavior:** If the user did not initiate this activity, or if **SDXHelper.exe** is not a known, trusted process on their system, this could indicate **malware** or **unauthorized software** attempting to deploy payloads.\n\n5. **Recommendations:**\n   - **Verify SDXHelper.exe:** Check if the process is associated with a legitimate application (e.g., via Task Manager, antivirus scans, or file reputation checks).\n   - **Monitor File Activity:** Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **File System Auditing** to track whether these files are being accessed or modified by other processes.\n   - **Review Recent Changes:** Determine if the user recently installed software, updated Office, or initiated a deployment that might explain this activity.\n   - **Check for Malware:** Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/anti-malware tools to rule out malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe activity is **potentially legitimate** if tied to a known Office Add-in development workflow. However, the lack of context (e.g., user intent, process origin) warrants further investigation to rule out malicious behavior."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each representing a file creation event. The main thing here is that almost all the entries have the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". Now, I know that SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the Office Deployment Tool. Its usual role is to help with installing or updating Office applications.\n\nBut wait, there's a lot of these events. Let me count. There are multiple entries with different hashes in the filenames. Each file seems to be a different version or part of an update. However, the fact that all these files are being created by SDXHelper.exe might be normal if the system is in the middle of an Office update. But then again, there's also one entry that's different: the one with \"SecurityEvent\" and \"winlogbeat\" in the process name. That looks like a security-related event, possibly from a monitoring tool like Winlogbeat, which is used for log collection and analysis. That entry mentions a \"SecurityEvent\" with ID 4688, which is about a new process creation. The process here is \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" with some command-line arguments. The arguments include \"-Command\" and a script that's downloading a file from a URL and executing it. The URL is \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/PowerShell\/PSReadLine\/master\/PSReadLine.nupkg\", which seems legitimate, but the fact that PowerShell is being used to download and execute a package might be suspicious, especially if it's not part of a known, approved process.\n\nNow, the rest of the entries are all about SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office installation directory. That's expected during an update. However, the presence of that one PowerShell event stands out. It could be part of a legitimate update process if, for example, the Office update requires PowerShell scripts to run. But it's also possible that this is a red flag. The URL mentioned in the PowerShell command is from GitHub, which is a common source for open-source projects, but downloading and executing a package directly from a URL without proper verification can be a security risk. Also, the fact that the event is logged as a SecurityEvent might indicate that the system's security tools are flagging this activity as potentially malicious.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the repetition of the SDXHelper.exe events. If this is part of a normal update, there should be a corresponding log entry indicating the update is in progress. However, if there's no such entry, or if the system is not expecting an update, this could be a sign of something unusual. Additionally, the PowerShell event's command-line arguments include \"-WindowStyle Hidden\", which might be an attempt to hide the process from the user, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nPutting this all together, the majority of the events are related to Office updates via SDXHelper, which is normal. However, the presence of the PowerShell event that's downloading and executing a package from a URL, especially with hidden window style, is suspicious. This could be a legitimate action if it's part of an authorized process, but without more context, it's a potential indicator of compromise. Therefore, the logs are a mix of normal activity and a possible security incident, which would warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a mix of **normal system activity** and **potentially suspicious behavior**. Here's a breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Normal Activity: SDXHelper.exe File Creations**\n- **Process**: `SDXHelper.exe` (part of Microsoft Office Deployment Tool) is creating files in the Office installation directory (`C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\...`).\n- **Purpose**: These files are likely part of an **Office update or installation** (e.g., language packs, configuration files, or dependencies).\n- **Legitimacy**: This is **expected behavior** during Office updates, especially if the system is in the middle of an upgrade or deployment.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Suspicious Activity: PowerShell Execution**\n- **Event**: A `SecurityEvent` (ID 4688) logs the creation of a PowerShell process:\n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe -Command \"Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/PowerShell\/PSReadLine\/master\/PSReadLine.nupkg -OutFile C:\\Users\\...\\PSReadLine.nupkg; Start-Process C:\\Users\\...\\PSReadLine.nupkg\"\n  ```\n- **Key Concerns**:\n  - **Unusual Command**: Downloading a `.nupkg` file (a NuGet package) from GitHub and executing it directly via PowerShell.\n  - **Hidden Window**: The `-WindowStyle Hidden` parameter suggests the user might want to **obscure the process** (common in malicious scripts).\n  - **Lack of Context**: No indication in the logs that this was part of a legitimate Office update or user-initiated action.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Risk Assessment**\n- **Low Risk (SDXHelper Activity)**: Normal during Office updates.\n- **Medium Risk (PowerShell Execution)**: The PowerShell command is **not inherently malicious**, but the **lack of transparency** (e.g., no user interaction, hidden window) raises concerns. The URL (`github.com\/PowerShell\/PSReadLine`) is legitimate, but **downloading and executing unverified packages** from external sources is risky.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommendations**\n- **Investigate the PowerShell Event**:\n  - Check if the user or administrator initiated this action.\n  - Verify if the `.nupkg` file is part of a known, approved process (e.g., a PowerShell module update).\n  - Ensure the system is not compromised (e.g., check for unexpected processes, network traffic to unknown IPs).\n- **Monitor SDXHelper Activity**:\n  - Confirm the Office update is expected and legitimate.\n  - Ensure no additional unexpected files are being created.\n- **Enable Logging for PowerShell**:\n  - Use tools like **Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)** or **SIEM** to monitor PowerShell usage and detect anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile most activity is **legitimate**, the **PowerShell event** warrants further investigation to rule out **unauthorized actions** or **potential compromise**. Always correlate logs with system context (e.g., update schedules, user activity) to avoid false positives."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, all showing that the SDXHelper.exe process is creating files in the Office PackageResources directory. Each entry has the same structure: the process name, the task \"File created\", and the file path. The file names are similar but have different hashes at the end.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, right? It might be involved in updates or installations. But creating so many files with different hashes could be a red flag. Maybe it's a legitimate process, but the high number of files might indicate something else.\n\nWait, the files are all in the OfflineFiles folder. That's part of the Office Click-to-Run deployment. Sometimes, during updates, temporary files are created there. But if this is happening frequently or in large numbers, it could be a sign of a problem. However, looking at the timestamps, if all these entries are from the same time, maybe it's just a one-time update.\n\nAnother angle: are these files legitimate? The names are all \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash. That seems like a pattern for localized resources or language packs. But the hashes are different each time. Maybe they're different versions or updates. However, if the hashes are random, that might not be right. Wait, the hashes look like SHA-1 or MD5 hashes. If they're legitimate, they should be consistent for the same file. But since they're different, that's suspicious.\n\nAlso, the fact that all these files are created by SDXHelper.exe might be normal, but if there are no corresponding deletion events, it could lead to disk space issues. But the user hasn't mentioned any errors or performance issues, so maybe it's just part of a normal update process.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. Yes, it's part of Office, but sometimes malware can mimic legitimate processes. However, the file paths are in the standard Office directories, which makes it more likely to be legitimate. Still, the high volume of files with varying hashes might be worth investigating further.\n\nIn the absence of other indicators like high CPU usage, network activity, or user complaints, it's possible that this is just a normal update process. But the user might want to monitor the disk usage and check for any unexpected behavior. Maybe running a virus scan or checking the integrity of the files could help confirm if they're legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the `SDXHelper.exe` process (associated with Microsoft Office) is creating multiple files in the `OfficePackageResources\\OfflineFiles` directory. These files are named with patterns like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>`, where the `<hash>` appears to be a unique identifier (e.g., SHA-1 or MD5). Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe`**:\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate component of Microsoft Office, often involved in **Click-to-Run deployments**, updates, or resource management. It is typically located in the Office installation directory (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16`).\n\n2. **File Creation Pattern**:\n   - The files being created (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>`) resemble **localized resource files** (e.g., language packs or UI strings). The `<hash>` may represent versioning or unique identifiers for different updates or configurations.\n\n3. **Potential Normal Behavior**:\n   - During Office updates or installations, `SDXHelper.exe` may generate temporary or cached files in the `OfflineFiles` directory. The repetition of entries could indicate a **batch update** or **resource deployment**.\n\n4. **Red Flags**:\n   - **High Volume of Files**: While not inherently malicious, the sheer number of files with unique hashes may suggest **unnecessary duplication** or **incomplete cleanup**.\n   - **Absence of Deletion Events**: If no corresponding deletion logs are present, this could lead to **disk space consumption** over time.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify File Integrity**:\n   - Check if the files are part of a legitimate Office update. Use tools like **Microsoft Office Repair** or **System File Checker** (`sfc \/scannow`) to ensure no corruption.\n\n2. **Monitor Disk Usage**:\n   - If the `OfflineFiles` directory is growing excessively, consider **cleaning temporary files** or **disabling unnecessary Office features** (e.g., via `Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows features on or off`).\n\n3. **Check for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus software to rule out **malware masquerading as `SDXHelper.exe`** (e.g., check the file's digital signature and hash against Microsoft's official binaries).\n\n4. **Review Office Logs**:\n   - Examine Office-specific logs (e.g., `%LocalAppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Logs`) for clues about update failures or resource conflicts.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe behavior is **likely legitimate** if tied to a recent Office update or installation. However, the high volume of files and unique hashes warrant further investigation to ensure no **malicious activity** or **unnecessary resource consumption** is occurring. If no errors or performance issues are observed, this may be a normal part of Office's update process."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first thing I notice is that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all named with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash or some random string. \n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe – I'm not too familiar with that process. Let me think. Microsoft Office has various helper tools, but I'm not sure if SDXHelper is a legitimate one. Maybe it's part of some add-in or a third-party software? But creating a lot of files in the Office directory, especially with those names... That seems a bit suspicious. \n\nWait, the files are all minified JavaScript files. Maybe they're part of some web component or extension? But why so many? And why in the Office directory? Also, there are two entries where chrome.exe is setting registry values. That might be normal if Chrome is updating something, but combined with the other events, it's a bit odd.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition. Each file creation event is duplicated. Like, each entry is repeated twice. That might be a log formatting issue, or maybe the system is logging each event twice. Not sure yet. But the fact that there are so many similar files being created could indicate some kind of automated process, maybe even malicious.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. Let me recall. If I remember correctly, some malware uses similar names to disguise themselves. Also, the presence of multiple files with different hashes might be an attempt to avoid detection. But without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe fact that the files are in the Office directory could be a red flag. Legitimate software usually doesn't create so many files there. Also, the names suggest they might be part of some script or extension, but again, the repetition and the number of files are concerning. \n\nAnother angle: the registry changes by Chrome. Maybe it's unrelated, but if the system is being compromised, multiple processes could be involved. However, without seeing the actual registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. \n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple file creations by an unknown or suspicious process (SDXHelper.exe) in a sensitive directory, with repetitive entries. That's enough to flag it as potentially malicious. Even if it's legitimate, the volume and pattern are unusual. Therefore, this warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a potential security concern based on the following observations:\n\n### **Key Findings:**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Multiple entries show `SDXHelper.exe` creating files named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>` in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\OfficeXX\\SolutionPackages\\...`.\n   - These files are **minified JavaScript files** (`.min` extension), which are common in web applications but unusual in the context of Microsoft Office directories.\n   - The repetitive nature of the logs (e.g., identical file creation events duplicated twice) may indicate **log formatting issues** or **unusual behavior** (e.g., automated processes or potential tampering).\n\n2. **Suspicious Process Name (`SDXHelper.exe`):**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is **not a well-known legitimate process** associated with Microsoft Office or standard Windows operations. While it could be a legitimate tool (e.g., a third-party add-in or utility), the lack of visibility in standard system processes raises concerns.\n\n3. **Unusual Location and Context:**\n   - The files are created in the **Office SolutionPackages directory**, which is typically used for **Office add-ins or templates**. However, the presence of numerous `.min` files here is atypical and may indicate **unauthorized software deployment** or **malware activity** (e.g., injecting malicious scripts).\n\n4. **Registry Modifications by `chrome.exe`:**\n   - Two entries show `chrome.exe` modifying registry values. While Chrome may legitimately update its own registry settings, this occurs **in conjunction with the suspicious file activity**, which could indicate **coordinated malicious behavior** (e.g., a browser-based attack leveraging Office).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Unusual File Creation Patterns:** High volume of `.min` files in non-standard directories.\n- **Unknown Process Activity:** `SDXHelper.exe` executing in sensitive locations.\n- **Lack of User Context:** No user interaction or clear purpose for the files is documented.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Check the **file path and digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` to determine its legitimacy.\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to analyze the process.\n   - Monitor for **network activity** or **registry changes** linked to this process.\n\n2. **Analyze the Created Files:**\n   - Decompile\/minify the `.min` files to check for malicious code (e.g., embedded scripts, payloads).\n   - Use **sandboxing** or **static analysis tools** (e.g., VirusTotal, IDA Pro) for deeper inspection.\n\n3. **Check for Malware Signatures:**\n   - Scan the system with updated antivirus\/malware scanners.\n   - Look for **false positives** or **zero-day exploits** related to the observed behavior.\n\n4. **Review Chrome Activity:**\n   - Investigate the registry changes made by `chrome.exe` to determine their purpose.\n   - Check for **unauthorized extensions** or **compromised browser profiles**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs suggest **potentially malicious activity** involving an unknown process (`SDXHelper.exe`) creating suspicious files in a Microsoft Office directory. Further investigation is warranted to confirm whether this represents a **malware infection**, **unauthorized software deployment**, or a **false positive**. Immediate action to isolate the system and analyze the files\/processes is recommended."}

The user provided a list of file creation events, all under the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" in the same directory structure. The files have similar names, all ending with \".min.js\" and varying hash-like strings. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if these files are legitimate or if they might be malicious. The fact that there are so many files created in the same directory could be a red flag. Typically, a legitimate application might not generate dozens of JavaScript files with random names in a user's AppData folder.\n\nNext, looking at the process name, \"SDXHelper.exe\" – I should check if this is a known legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper might be related to some software, but it's not a standard Windows process. If this is part of a legitimate application, the files might be part of its normal operation. However, the presence of multiple files with unique hashes could indicate that they're being generated dynamically, which is common in some malware to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the directory path: \"C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Temporary Internet Files\\Content.IE5\\...\" – this is a temporary internet files folder. Malware often uses such directories to store temporary files. However, legitimate applications might also use this area for caching, but again, the number of files here is high.\n\nThe files have names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min.js\" – the term \"office\" might be a keyword here. If this is related to Microsoft Office, but the process name doesn't align with Office. Alternatively, \"aicopilot\" could be a typo or a misinterpretation of a word. Maybe \"AI Copilot\"? But that's speculative.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a false positive. If the user is running some software that legitimately generates these files, then it's not malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The key indicators here are the volume of files, the directory location, and the unusual process name.\n\nAnother angle: checking the hash values. If these files have known malicious hashes in virus databases, that would confirm it. But since the user hasn't provided hashes, just filenames, I can't check that directly. However, the fact that each file has a unique hash suggests they might be different, which is suspicious.\n\nIn summary, while there's no definitive proof here, the combination of a non-standard process, multiple files in a temporary directory, and the naming pattern raises concerns. It's possible this is malware, but further investigation would be needed, such as checking the process's origin, digital signatures, and analyzing the files with antivirus tools.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided data shows multiple file creation events under the process **`SDXHelper.exe`** in the directory:  \n`C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Temporary Internet Files\\Content.IE5\\...`.  \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **High Volume of Files**:\n   - Over **20 files** are created, all named similarly:  \n     `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` with unique hash-like suffixes (e.g., `6d5a1a2afce2bb6422b189d37432ea56.js`).  \n   - This pattern is unusual for legitimate software, which typically does not generate dozens of `.min.js` files with random hashes in temporary directories.\n\n2. **Suspicious Process Name**:\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is not a standard Windows process. While it could be part of a legitimate application, its name lacks clarity and does not align with well-known software.\n\n3. **Directory Location**:\n   - The files are stored in the **Temporary Internet Files** folder (`Content.IE5`), which is often used by malware to evade detection or cache malicious payloads.\n\n4. **File Naming and Purpose**:\n   - The filenames suggest they might be JavaScript resources (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js`), but the lack of a clear purpose (e.g., no association with known legitimate software) raises concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Risks:\n- **Malware Indicators**:  \n  The behavior aligns with tactics used by malware to:  \n  - Generate temporary files in non-standard locations.  \n  - Use obfuscation (hash-like filenames) to avoid detection.  \n  - Exploit temporary directories for persistence or data exfiltration.  \n\n- **Legitimate Software?**  \n  While possible, the absence of a clear association with any known legitimate application (e.g., no vendor name, no context in the filenames) makes this less likely.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Check Process Origin**:  \n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Task Manager** to inspect the **`SDXHelper.exe`** process (e.g., its **file path**, **digital signature**, **parent process**).\n\n2. **Scan for Malware**:  \n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/antimalware tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes).  \n   - Submit the files to malware analysis platforms (e.g., VirusTotal) if accessible.\n\n3. **Monitor Behavior**:  \n   - Use a sandbox or behavioral analysis tool to observe if the process interacts with networks, modifies system settings, or accesses sensitive data.\n\n4. **Remove Suspicious Files**:  \n   - If the files are confirmed malicious, delete them and investigate the source of the `SDXHelper.exe` process.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe activity is **highly suspicious** and likely **malicious**.

The filenames follow a pattern: `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`, with varying hash values.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Repetition and Volume**:\n   - The same process (`SDXHelper.exe`) is repeatedly creating files in the same directory.\n   - While this could be part of a legitimate process (e.g., generating or updating language\/resource files), the high volume and repetitive nature may indicate unusual behavior.\n\n2. **File Naming and Hashes**:\n   - The filenames use unique hash values, which could be normal if they represent different versions or translations of the same resource.\n   - However, the lack of clear context (e.g., timestamps, file sizes, or associated application activity) makes it harder to determine legitimacy.\n\n3. **Potential Indicators of Suspicious Activity**:\n   - **Unusual File Generation**: If `SDXHelper.exe` is not known to generate `.min.js` files in this location, this could be anomalous.\n   - **Lack of Context**: No additional details (e.g., user interaction, system state, or other related logs) are provided to confirm legitimacy.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Potentially Suspicious, but Not Definitely Malicious**  \nWhile the behavior could be part of a legitimate process (e.g., resource updates), the repetitive creation of files with similar names and hashes in a non-standard context warrants further investigation. Consider:\n- Verifying the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., checking its digital signature, file path, and hash against Microsoft's known binaries).\n- Monitoring for additional suspicious activity (e.g., network connections, registry changes, or unexpected process behavior).\n- Cross-referencing with system logs, antivirus alerts, or endpoint detection tools for context.\n\n**Recommendation**: Investigate further using forensic tools or consult Microsoft's documentation to confirm whether this behavior is expected for the identified process."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a list of file creation events all related to the same process, SDXHelper.exe, in the directory C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. Each entry is a JavaScript file (ending with .min.js) with different names. The task is to determine if this is a security threat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what SDXHelper.exe is. Maybe it's a legitimate Microsoft Office component? I should check that. If it's a legitimate process, then the file creations might be part of normal operations, like updates or resource loading. However, if SDXHelper.exe isn't a known Microsoft process, that's a red flag.\n\nLooking at the file names, they all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min.js\". The \"aicopilot\" part might be a typo or a specific project name. \"Strings\" in JavaScript files usually refer to localization files, so maybe these are language packs. But why so many of them? Office might use multiple language packs, but creating so many files in a short time could be suspicious.\n\nNext, the directory path includes \"SolutionPackages\" and \"OfflineFiles\". Maybe these files are part of an offline installation or a package being deployed. However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files might indicate that the process is being used to inject or download additional files. \n\nI should consider the possibility of malware. Malware often creates many files in temporary or user-specific directories. The use of .min.js files could be a way to obfuscate the content, making it harder to detect. Also, the fact that all files are created by the same process without any other user interaction might be suspicious.\n\nAnother angle: check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. A quick search shows that SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, particularly with the \"Solution Packages\" feature, which might be related to add-ins or templates. However, it's important to confirm if this is the case. If the process is legitimate, the file creation might be normal. But if the process is not known or if there are no legitimate reasons for creating so many .min.js files, then it's more likely malicious.\n\nAlso, the fact that all these files are in the OfflineFiles directory suggests they might be part of a package that's being cached or used offline. However, the number of files (over 15 entries) seems excessive. Legitimate software might create a few files, but not multiple copies of similar files.\n\nAnother point is the naming pattern. The hash-like part in the directory name (8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f) might be a unique identifier for a package or version. If that's the case, it's a normal part of the file structure. However, the repetition of the same process creating these files could still be a red flag if it's not a known behavior.\n\nI should also consider if there are any known malware samples that use similar naming conventions or processes. For example, some malware uses JavaScript files to execute code or download payloads. The .min.js extension is common in legitimate code for minification, but it's also used by malware to hide malicious scripts.\n\nIn conclusion, without more context, the creation of multiple .min.js files by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory could be either legitimate (if SDXHelper is a known process and the files are part of a legitimate package) or malicious (if the process is not known or the files are part of a malicious payload). Further investigation would involve checking the digital signature of SDXHelper.exe, verifying its location (should be in a Microsoft directory), and analyzing the contents of the .min.js files for suspicious code.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process is creating multiple JavaScript files (`.min.js`) in a specific directory. Here's a structured analysis of the situation:\n\n### 1. **Understanding SDXHelper.exe**\n   - **Legitimacy**: `SDXHelper.exe` is associated with **Microsoft Office**, particularly with features related to **Solution Packages** (e.g., add-ins or templates). It is typically found in legitimate Microsoft directories (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office`).\n   - **Context**: If the process is running from a **legitimate Microsoft location** and the files are part of a **known package** (e.g., language packs, templates), this activity may be normal.\n\n### 2. **File Naming and Behavior**\n   - **File Names**: The `.min.js` files appear to be **minified JavaScript** files, which are common in both legitimate applications (for optimization) and malicious payloads (to obfuscate code).\n   - **Directory Structure**: The files are stored in `OfflineFiles`, which might be part of a **cached or offline installation** of a package. However, the **high volume** (over 15 files) and **repetition of the same process** could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate operations** (e.g., deploying a large package with multiple language\/localization files).\n     - **Malicious activity** (e.g., downloading and executing malicious scripts).\n\n### 3. **Red Flags**\n   - **Unusual File Volume**: Creating **multiple copies** of similar files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js`) in a short time is atypical for legitimate software.\n   - **Suspicious Naming**: The term `aicopilot` may be a typo or a placeholder, but it could also be a **custom identifier** for a malicious payload.\n   - **Lack of User Interaction**: The files are created by a single process without user input, which is suspicious for legitimate software.\n\n### 4. **Potential Threats**\n   - **Malware Infection**: The files could be **malicious scripts** used to:\n     - Execute code in the browser or system.\n     - Download additional payloads.\n     - Bypass security measures (e.g., obfuscation via minification).\n   - **Phishing or Exploitation**: If these files are part of a **phishing attack** or **exploit kit**, they might be used to compromise the system.\n\n### 5. **Next Steps for Investigation**\n   - **Verify Process Legitimacy**:\n     - Check the **file path** of `SDXHelper.exe`. Legitimate Microsoft processes are typically in `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office` or similar directories.\n     - Confirm the **digital signature** of the executable (via Properties > Digital Signatures).\n   - **Analyze File Contents**:\n     - Use a hex editor or de-minifier tool to inspect the `.min.js` files for suspicious code (e.g., obfuscation, URLs, or API calls).\n   - **Scan for Malware**:\n     - Run a **full system scan** with updated antivirus\/malware tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes).\n   - **Monitor Network Activity**:\n     - Check if `SDXHelper.exe` is communicating with **unusual IP addresses** or domains.\n\n### 6. **Conclusion**\nWhile **SDXHelper.exe** may be a legitimate process, the **high volume of `.min.js` files** and **lack of clear context** suggest a need for further investigation. If the process is **not from a known Microsoft location** or the files contain **suspicious code**, this could indicate a **malware infection** or **malicious activity**. Immediate action (e.g., scanning, isolating the system, or contacting Microsoft support) is recommended."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating a file creation event. The main thing here is to figure out if there's anything suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating JavaScript files in a specific directory under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The file names all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a hash and \".js\". That seems a bit odd. Why would SDXHelper.exe be creating so many JavaScript files in that location? Maybe it's part of some legitimate software update or installation? But I'm not sure.\n\nThen there's one entry from \"chrome.exe\" creating a temporary file in the Downloads directory. That's more typical, as Chrome might download files and create temporary files. But the rest are all from SDXHelper.exe. \n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, possibly related to updates or add-ins. However, creating multiple JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages directory might not be standard. Usually, Office updates would install files in different directories, maybe within the Program Files or AppData.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the naming pattern of the files. The use of \"min_\" suggests minified JavaScript, which is common for web applications. But why would they be stored in the Office directory? Maybe it's part of an Office add-in that's being updated, but the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times might indicate something. Wait, looking at the logs, some files are created multiple times. For example, \"min_97a3b3b45b83dda327cdb2b00b9f984.js\" appears twice. Maybe that's just a normal process, but it's worth noting.\n\nAlso, the temporary file created by Chrome might be unrelated, but the fact that it's in the Downloads folder and named with a UUID is typical for downloads. However, if that file were malicious, it might not be named like that. But since there's only one entry, it's probably not a concern here.\n\nNow, considering possible threats: if SDXHelper.exe is being used to inject malicious code, the JavaScript files could be part of that. However, without more context, like process tree, parent processes, or network activity, it's hard to say. But the fact that all these files are in the Office directory might be a red flag if they're not supposed to be there.\n\nAnother angle: the use of \"SolutionPackages\" might be related to Click-to-Run installations for Office, which do involve some package management. However, the presence of so many JavaScript files in that directory could be unusual. Maybe it's a legitimate update, but I'm not certain.\n\nI should also check if there are any known issues or malware that uses SDXHelper.exe. Quick search in my mind: sometimes malware masquerades as legitimate processes. But without more information, it's hard to confirm. However, the fact that the files are all JavaScript and in a specific pattern might be suspicious.\n\nIn summary, while some of these events could be legitimate, the high number of JavaScript files created by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard location, along with the repetition of file names, might indicate something unusual. It's worth further investigation, like checking the integrity of SDXHelper.exe, looking at the parent processes, and examining network traffic related to these files. But based solely on the logs provided, it's not conclusive, but there's enough to flag it as potentially suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a series of file creation events, primarily from the process **`SDXHelper.exe`**, which is associated with Microsoft Office. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **`SDXHelper.exe` Activity**:\n   - **Location**: Files are created in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\{username}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceeb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`.\n   - **File Pattern**: All files are JavaScript files named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_{hash}.js`, with multiple entries for the same file (e.g., `min_97a3b3b45b83dda327cdb2b00b9f984.js` appears twice).\n   - **Quantity**: A total of **15 files** are created, all by `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n2. **`chrome.exe` Activity**:\n   - A single temporary file (`ad71f2ea-b333-47d3-90de-05df187121c9.tmp`) is created in the `Downloads` directory. This is typical for Chrome downloads and likely benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Concern**\n- **Unusual File Location**:  \n  The `SolutionPackages` directory is part of Microsoft Office's Click-to-Run installation framework. While it may store package metadata or updates, **JavaScript files** being created here are **not standard** for this directory. This could indicate:\n  - **Legitimate but non-standard behavior** (e.g., an Office add-in or custom update).\n  - **Malicious activity** (e.g., injection of scripts or exploitation of Office components).\n\n- **Repetitive File Creation**:  \n  The same file names being created multiple times (e.g., `min_97a3b3b45b83dda327cdb2b00b9f984.js`) may suggest **redundant operations** or **injection attempts**. This warrants further investigation into the process's behavior.\n\n- **`SDXHelper.exe` Reputation**:  \n  While `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft Office process, **malware can masquerade as it**. Confirming the process's **digital signature** and **parent process** (e.g., via task tree or process explorer) is critical to rule out impersonation.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Process Integrity**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (should be signed by Microsoft).\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Windows Defender** to confirm the process is not being impersonated.\n\n2. **Monitor for Unusual Behavior**:\n   - Investigate if `SDXHelper.exe` is communicating with suspicious IP addresses or domains.\n   - Check for **file modifications** in the `SolutionPackages` directory using tools like **Sysinternals' Handle** or **Process Monitor**.\n\n3. **Check for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/anti-malware tools.\n   - Use **Windows Defender Offline** to detect deeply embedded threats.\n\n4. **Review Office Add-ins**:\n   - If the user has Office 365, check for **unauthorized add-ins** via the **Office Application Settings**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the activity could be **legitimate** (e.g., a custom Office update or add-in), the **unusual file location**, **repetition of files**, and **lack of transparency** in the behavior raise **red flags**. Further investigation is required to confirm whether this is a **benign process** or **malicious activity**."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all showing that the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the same directory under Microsoft Office's PackageResources. The files are all named similarly, with variations in the hash part before the .js extension. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. Office applications sometimes generate temporary files or cache data, but the repetition here might be a clue. Each entry is a separate event, but they're all in the same location and by the same process. \n\nNow, looking at the file names: they all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a unique hash and then .js. The hash part is different each time, which might indicate different versions or possibly different components. But why would SDXHelper.exe be creating so many of these files?\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper is related to Microsoft's software, possibly part of the Office suite or another Microsoft application. However, creating numerous .js files in the PackageResources folder could be unusual. Legitimate processes might cache files, but typically not in such quantities unless there's a specific reason, like an update or a feature that requires many resources.\n\nAnother angle: the files are all JavaScript files. If these are being generated dynamically, maybe as part of some web-based component within Office, but again, the volume seems high. Also, the repetition of the same process creating each file might indicate a loop or a bug where the process is repeatedly generating these files without cleaning up after itself.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of malware. Malware can sometimes create a lot of files in system directories to hide its presence or to carry out malicious activities. However, SDXHelper.exe being a known Microsoft process complicates that. But if this is a legitimate process, maybe there's a configuration issue or a corrupted installation causing this behavior.\n\nAnother thought: maybe these files are part of an update or a new feature being rolled out. If the system is in the middle of an update, temporary files might be created. However, the logs don't mention any update activity, so that's speculative.\n\nI should also check if the user has any recent installations or updates that might have caused this. If the user installed a new version of Office or another Microsoft product, it's possible that during installation, these files are being generated. But again, the number of files seems excessive.\n\nLooking at the file paths again: they're all in the same directory, which is under the user's AppData. That's a common location for temporary files, but again, the quantity is notable. If these files are temporary, they should be deleted after use, but if they're not being cleaned up, that could be an issue.\n\nAnother consideration is whether these files are actually being used by the application. If they're just being created and never accessed, that might be a problem. But without more logs, like file access events, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn conclusion, while SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, the high volume of .js files created in the same directory might indicate an issue such as a bug in the application, a misconfiguration, or even potential malware masquerading as a legitimate process. Further investigation, such as checking for updates, running a malware scan, or reviewing system logs for more context, would be necessary to determine the exact cause.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that the `SDXHelper.exe` process is generating multiple `.js` files in the same directory under Microsoft Office's `PackageResources` folder. Here's a structured analysis and recommendation:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process and File Pattern:**\n   - **Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` (likely a legitimate Microsoft process, possibly related to Office or other Microsoft applications).\n   - **Files Created:** All files are named similarly: `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js` (with unique hash values), suggesting dynamic generation.\n\n2. **Volume and Repetition:**\n   - **High Volume:** Over 16 files are created, all by the same process in the same location.\n   - **Repetition:** Each file is logged as a separate event, but the pattern is highly consistent, raising questions about purpose and cleanup.\n\n3. **File Location:**\n   - **Path:** `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...` — a common location for temporary or cached files, but excessive generation here may indicate an issue.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Causes:**\n\n#### **1. Legitimate Behavior (Possible Scenarios):**\n- **Caching\/Temporary Files:** The files might be temporary resources generated during Office operations (e.g., add-ins, language packs, or UI components).\n- **Update Activity:** If the system is mid-update, temporary files could be created. However, this is speculative without additional context.\n\n#### **2. Anomalies or Issues:**\n- **Infinite Loop or Bug:** The process might be repeatedly generating files due to a bug (e.g., incorrect file cleanup logic).\n- **Malware Masquerading as Legitimate:** While `SDXHelper.exe` is a known Microsoft process, malware could exploit its name to create suspicious files. However, this would require further investigation (e.g., checking file hashes, digital signatures, or behavior).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n#### **1. Verify Legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n- **Check File Signature:** Ensure the executable is digitally signed by Microsoft (right-click > Properties > Digital Signatures).\n- **Process Tree:** Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Task Manager** to confirm the parent process and verify no suspicious activity.\n\n#### **2. Investigate File Purpose:**\n- **File Content Analysis:** Open one of the `.js` files (if not encrypted) to check for legitimate code (e.g., language strings, UI components) or malicious payloads.\n- **Search for References:** Check if the hash patterns match known Microsoft resources or are unique to the system.\n\n#### **3. System Health Checks:**\n- **Malware Scan:** Run a full system scan using Windows Defender or a third-party tool to rule out malware.\n- **Disk Cleanup:** Monitor the directory for orphaned files and ensure they are deleted after use (e.g., via scheduled tasks or cleanup scripts).\n\n#### **4. Update and Reinstall:**\n- **Office Updates:** Ensure Microsoft Office is up to date. Corrupted installations can cause unexpected behavior.\n- **Reinstall Office:** If the issue persists, consider repairing or reinstalling Office to resolve potential configuration issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the behavior could be legitimate (e.g., temporary file generation during Office operations), the high volume of files and repetition warrant further investigation. Prioritize verifying the legitimacy of the process, analyzing the files, and ensuring the system is free of malware. If no malicious activity is found and the files are temporary, the issue may be a benign but inefficient process."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash. The same file paths are repeated multiple times, which might indicate that the process is creating these files repeatedly. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. I recall that some malware uses similar names to mimic legitimate processes. The fact that these files are being created in the AppData directory under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages could be a red flag. Legitimate software usually doesn't create multiple JavaScript files in such a location, especially with those naming patterns. \n\nThen there's the chrome.exe process. One event shows a registry value set, and another shows an image loaded (urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll). The image loaded events are normal because chrome uses those DLLs. The registry event might be part of normal operations, but I need to check if it's related to the other activities. However, the main concern here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the file paths. The files are being created in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. If the user is working offline, maybe that's normal, but the repetition and the nature of the files (JavaScript) make me think it's not. Also, the hashes in the filenames could be part of obfuscation or unique identifiers for malicious payloads.\n\nI should also check if there are any other processes involved. The chrome.exe events don't seem suspicious on their own. The SDXHelper.exe is the main actor here. The fact that it's creating so many files could be an attempt to persist or execute code. \n\nIs there any indication of malware? The naming and the location are suspicious. Also, the fact that the same files are created multiple times might suggest that the process is trying to establish a foothold or communicate with a command-and-control server. \n\nHowever, I should not jump to conclusions. Maybe the user is running some legitimate software that uses SDXHelper.exe. But given the information, the repeated file creation in that specific directory with those filenames is a strong indicator of something malicious. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch of logs shows multiple file creation events by a non-standard process in a location that's typically used by legitimate software but in a way that's unusual. This warrants further investigation to confirm if it's malicious or a false positive.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows **multiple suspicious activities** that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Path:** `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`\n   - **Files Created:** JavaScript files named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js` (e.g., `min_eaf004e5319b47ef0404822a78e7075c.js`).\n   - **Pattern:** The same file paths are logged multiple times, suggesting repeated creation. This is unusual for legitimate software and may indicate **malicious persistence** or **data exfiltration**.\n\n2. **Unusual Process Behavior:**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Windows process. Its activity in the `SolutionPackages` directory (typically used by Microsoft Office) raises concerns about **masquerading** or **exploitation**.\n\n3. **Potential Malware Indicators:**\n   - The filename pattern (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) resembles obfuscated or dynamically generated payloads, common in malware.\n   - The `OfflineFiles` subdirectory might be used to evade detection or store malicious content.\n\n4. **Legitimate Activity (Chrome):**\n   - `chrome.exe` events (e.g., loading `urlmon.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) are normal and unrelated to the suspicious activity.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs **strongly indicate a potential security threat**. The repetitive file creation by `SDXHelper.exe` in a non-standard location with obfuscated filenames is highly suspicious. Further investigation is required, including:\n- Checking if `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate process (e.g., via file reputation, digital signatures).\n- Analyzing the contents of the created JavaScript files.\n- Monitoring network traffic from `SDXHelper.exe` for C2 communication.\n\n**Recommendation:** Isolate the affected system, perform a full malware scan, and investigate the origin of `SDXHelper.exe`."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's about chrome.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. The file is MpClient.dll, which is a legitimate Defender component. So that might be normal. But then there are multiple entries for SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The file names are officeaicopilot-strings.min...js. These look like JavaScript files, maybe part of some Office add-in or copilot feature. But why are they being created multiple times? Also, the same file paths are repeated, which might indicate some kind of duplication or maybe a script that's being repeatedly executed.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events by chrome.exe. Changing registry values can be a red flag if done by a browser, but maybe it's related to some legitimate extension or settings. However, repeated registry changes could be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing is the file streams created for the Excel file \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\". The Zone.Identifier streams are usually created when files are downloaded from the internet, marking them as coming from a different zone (like the internet) which can trigger security warnings. But there are multiple entries for creating these streams, which might be normal if the file is being accessed multiple times, but maybe not.\n\nThe DNS query by chrome.exe is normal, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nNow, looking at the SDXHelper.exe events again. Microsoft Office SolutionPackages are part of Office 365, but the files being created are JavaScript files. If these are part of a legitimate Office add-in, it's okay, but if they're being created by a process named SDXHelper.exe, which isn't a standard Microsoft process, that could be a problem. Maybe SDXHelper is a legitimate tool, but the repeated creation of these JS files might indicate some kind of persistent behavior or data exfiltration.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple FileCreate events for the same files might suggest that the process is generating these files each time, which isn't typical for normal operations. It could be a sign of malware generating its own files or trying to inject code.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of unusual file creations by SDXHelper.exe, repeated registry changes by chrome.exe, and the Zone.Identifier streams might indicate something worth investigating. However, without more context or known bad indicators (like hashes, network connections, etc.), it's a bit tricky. But given the patterns here, it's probably a good idea to flag this for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Activity:**\n   - **`chrome.exe` interacting with Windows Defender (`MpClient.dll`)**: This is expected behavior for a browser interacting with system security components.\n   - **Zone.Identifier streams**: These are standard for downloaded files, marking them as originating from the internet to trigger security warnings.\n\n2. **Suspicious Patterns:**\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe` creating repeated JavaScript files** in the Office `SolutionPackages` directory:\n     - **File naming**: `officeaicopilot-strings.min...js` suggests potential ties to Microsoft Office (e.g., Copilot add-ins), but the **repetition** of identical file creation events is unusual. This could indicate **persistent behavior** (e.g., payload generation, logging, or injection).\n     - **`SDXHelper.exe`**: Not a standard Microsoft process. While it might be a legitimate tool, its association with Office directories raises flags.\n   - **`chrome.exe` registry modifications**: Frequent changes to registry values by a browser are atypical and could indicate **malware persistence** or **extension tampering**.\n   - **Multiple `FileCreateStreamHash` events** for the same Excel file (`Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`): Suggests **repeated file access** or **tampering** (e.g., embedded malicious content).\n\n3. **Missing Context:**\n   - No **network activity** (e.g., DNS queries to suspicious domains) is highlighted in the logs, though one `DnsQuery` event by `chrome.exe` is noted (insufficient data to assess risk).\n   - **File hashes** or **process integrity checks** (e.g., signed binaries) are absent, making it harder to confirm legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity**: **Moderate to High**.\n  - The **repeated file creation** by `SDXHelper.exe` and **unusual registry changes** by `chrome.exe` are red flags.\n  - The **lack of clear legitimacy** for `SDXHelper.exe` and the repetitive nature of events suggest potential **malware persistence** or **data exfiltration**.\n- **False Positive Risk**: **Low**.\n  - While some activity (e.g., Zone.Identifier streams) is benign, the **combination of suspicious processes and repetitive events** increases the likelihood of a genuine threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Verify its **digital signature**, **file path**, and **parent process**.\n   - Check for **unusual network behavior** or **file modifications**.\n2. **Analyze Registry Changes:**\n   - Review the **specific registry keys** modified by `chrome.exe` for signs of tampering.\n3. **Monitor the Excel File:**\n   - Use tools like **VirusTotal** or **sandboxing** to scan `Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx` for malicious content.\n4. **Correlate with Network Logs:**\n   - Cross-reference DNS queries and other network activity to identify potential C2 communication.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events **warrants further investigation** due to the **unusual behavior** of `SDXHelper.exe` and `chrome.exe`, which could indicate **malware persistence** or **data exfiltration**. While not definitively malicious, the patterns observed are inconsistent with typical user behavior and require deeper analysis."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll scan through the entries to see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of some Office add-in or solution. The paths are all under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages, which is a known location for Office solutions. The filenames have hashes in them, which might be versioning or unique identifiers. \n\nBut wait, there are multiple entries for the same files being created. Like, officeaicopilot-strings.min_js files are created multiple times with different hash suffixes. That might be normal if they're part of an update or installation process. However, the repetition could also be a red flag if it's unexpected. \n\nThen there's an entry for chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL for URL handling. That seems normal. Another entry is winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file in Downloads, which might be part of a configuration setup. Then, there's a registry event from chrome.exe, but no file path is given there. \n\nThe Excel process is opened with a specific .xlsx file, and then it loads combase.dll, which is part of the Windows COM infrastructure. Also normal. \n\nNow, the key thing here is SDXHelper.exe. I know that SDXHelper is related to Microsoft's Office Add-in infrastructure, used for sideloading add-ins. So, creating files in the SolutionPackages directory is part of deploying those add-ins. However, if there are a lot of these files being created, or if they're from unknown sources, that could be suspicious. \n\nBut looking at the filenames, they all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_js\". That might be a legitimate add-in, maybe related to AI Copilot features in Office. The repetition of the same file names with different hashes might be updates or different versions of the same add-in. \n\nHowever, I should check if there are any other suspicious activities. The other entries seem normal: Chrome loading DLLs, Excel opening a file, Winlogbeat creating a config file. No signs of malware or unusual processes. \n\nBut wait, is SDXHelper.exe a legitimate process? Yes, it's part of the Office Add-in installer. So, if the user is installing or updating Office add-ins, this is expected. However, if the user didn't initiate such an action, it could be a concern. Since the logs don't provide context on user actions, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother angle: the number of file creations. There are multiple entries for different JS files. If this is part of a legitimate installation, it's normal. But if it's part of a malicious payload, it could be. However, without more context, like the source of the files or other malicious activities, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe presence of Winlogbeat is also normal if the user is monitoring logs. The registry event from Chrome might be part of normal operations. \n\nIn conclusion, the majority of these events seem related to legitimate Office add-in deployments and normal system processes. However, the repeated creation of files by SDXHelper.exe could be worth investigating further to ensure that it's part of a legitimate process and not a potential security threat. But based solely on the provided logs, without additional context, it's not definitively suspicious. However, the fact that there are multiple file creations and the involvement of SDXHelper might still be flagged for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a mix of **legitimate system and application activities** and **potential areas for further investigation**. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Legitimate Activity**\n- **Office Add-in Deployment**:\n  - **SDXHelper.exe** creating JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_js`) in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` is **normal** for **sideloading Office add-ins** (e.g., AI Copilot features). These files are likely part of a **legitimate deployment or update** process.\n  - Repeated creation of similar files with different hash suffixes may indicate **versioning or incremental updates**.\n\n- **Standard System Processes**:\n  - **Chrome.exe** loading `urlmon.dll` and `combase.dll` is **expected** for web browsing and COM interactions.\n  - **Excel.EXE** opening a `.xlsx` file and loading `combase.dll` is **normal** for Excel operations.\n\n- **Winlogbeat Configuration**:\n  - The creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` in the `Downloads` directory is **typical** during configuration setup for log monitoring.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potential Red Flags (Worth Investigating)**\n- **Unusual File Creation Frequency**:\n  - The **repeated creation of identical file names** (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_js` with varying hash suffixes) could indicate **unexpected updates** or **unauthorized activity** if not aligned with known add-in deployments.\n\n- **SDXHelper.exe Context**:\n  - While **SDXHelper.exe** is legitimate, its involvement in creating multiple files **without clear user context** (e.g., no mention of user-initiated add-in installation) warrants scrutiny. Ensure these files are **signed by Microsoft** and **associated with known add-ins**.\n\n- **Registry Event**:\n  - The **registry value set** by **chrome.exe** lacks file context, which could be benign (e.g., browser settings) or **indicative of tampering** if unrelated to user activity.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Recommendation**\n- **Correlate with User Activity**:\n  - Confirm if the user **initiated** add-in installations or updates. If not, investigate further.\n- **Verify File Signatures**:\n  - Check the **digital signatures** of files created by **SDXHelper.exe** to ensure they are **legitimate Microsoft-signed components**.\n- **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n  - Use EDR\/XDR tools to detect **unusual behavior** (e.g., unexpected network traffic, unauthorized file modifications) from **SDXHelper.exe** or other processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs **do not definitively indicate malicious activity**, but the **repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe** and **lack of user context** merit **closer inspection** to rule out potential threats. If the files are linked to **known, legitimate add-ins** and no other anomalies are observed, the activity is likely benign."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries related to EXCEL.EXE loading various DLL files. Some of these are standard system files like mscoree.dll, urlmon.dll, and amsi.dll. Those are commonly used by Windows and Office, so that's normal. But I also see entries where SDXHelper.exe is creating JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That seems a bit unusual because SDXHelper is associated with Microsoft Office, but creating JS files in those locations might be part of a malicious payload.\n\nWait, there's also a file named ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx being created and then deleted. The tilde and dollar sign in the filename suggest it's an AutoSave file from Excel, which is normal. But the fact that it's created and then deleted might be a red flag if it's part of some malicious activity, though that's not always the case.\n\nLooking at the registry events, there are multiple Registry value set events from svchost.exe. That's a bit concerning because svchost is a generic host process for Windows services. If it's modifying registry values, especially if it's done multiple times, it could indicate some form of persistence or configuration change. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nThe repeated creation of JavaScript files by SDXHelper.exe in the Office directory might be more suspicious. Office add-ins or solutions sometimes use such directories, but if those JS files are not part of a legitimate add-in, they could be malicious. Also, the fact that the same file is created twice by SDXHelper.exe might indicate an attempt to overwrite or install something.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a mix of normal Office activities and some potentially suspicious file creations and registry changes. However, the presence of multiple legitimate system files being loaded by Excel and svchost.exe's registry activity doesn't necessarily point to a security threat. The key points are the unusual JS files and the repeated actions. But without more evidence like network connections or unusual process behavior, it's a bit ambiguous. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of these events could indicate a potential compromise, but the confidence isn't extremely high.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in Office SolutionPackages directory (potential malicious payload), EXCEL.EXE loading unusual DLLs, and repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. The first one is about HxTsr.exe setting a registry value. Not sure about that yet. Then there are multiple entries for SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and .js extensions. They all seem to be part of some package resources. Then there's EXCEL.EXE creating a temp Excel file and loading some DLLs. \n\nHmm, the SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles folder. That might be normal if it's part of Office's localization or some add-in. But why so many different language files? Maybe it's just installing language packs. However, the names are a bit generic. Also, the EXCEL.EXE events show creating a Zone.Identifier stream, which is usually for marking files as coming from the internet. But that's a normal part of handling downloaded files.\n\nWait, the first event with HxTsr.exe modifying the registry. I'm not familiar with that process. Maybe it's a legitimate process, but sometimes malicious software uses registry changes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The rest of the events seem to be related to Office operations. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? So creating those JS files might be part of some update or installation process. But the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could be a red flag. Maybe it's a benign process, but the combination with the registry change might warrant further investigation. \n\nOverall, I don't see obvious signs of malware, but the HxTsr.exe registry change and the multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe could be worth checking. Maybe the user should verify if these processes are expected in their environment. If they're not, then it might be a security issue.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries primarily involve legitimate Office-related activities, but there are a few points warranting closer scrutiny:\n\n### **1. HxTsr.exe Registry Modification**\n- **Event**: `HxTsr.exe` modifying a registry value.\n- **Analysis**: \n  - `HxTsr.exe` is not a well-known Microsoft process. While it could be part of a legitimate application, its presence and registry modifications merit investigation.\n  - **Risk**: Unfamiliar processes modifying the registry may indicate malware (e.g., persistence mechanisms or configuration changes).\n  - **Action**: Verify if this process is expected on the system. Check for associated files, network activity, or user context.\n\n---\n\n### **2. SDXHelper.exe File Creation**\n- **Events**: Repeated creation of `.js` files in `Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` with language-specific names (e.g., `az-latn-az-ui-strings-json_...`).\n- **Analysis**:\n  - **Legitimate Behavior**: `SDXHelper.exe` is part of Microsoft Office (e.g., related to language packs or resource management). The `.js` files might be localization assets or part of an Office update.\n  - **Red Flags**:\n    - **Redundancy**: The same files are created multiple times (e.g., `az-latn-az-ui-strings-json_...` appears twice). This could indicate a benign loop (e.g., retrying a failed operation) or a potential issue (e.g., malicious duplication).\n    - **Offline Files**: The `OfflineFiles` directory is typically used for cached resources, but excessive writes here might suggest unexpected behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **3. EXCEL.EXE Activity**\n- **Events**: \n  - Creation of a temporary Excel file (`1680A406.xlsx`) and its `Zone.Identifier` stream (marks files as \"downloaded from the internet\").\n  - Loading of system DLLs (`coml2.dll`, `VBEUI.DLL`).\n- **Analysis**:\n  - **Normal**: Temporary files and zone identifiers are standard for handling downloaded files. The loaded DLLs are legitimate Office components.\n  - **No Suspicion**: No anomalies detected here.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Likely Benign**: Most activity appears related to Office operations (e.g., language packs, temporary files).\n- **Investigate Further**:\n  - Confirm the legitimacy of `HxTsr.exe` and its registry changes.\n  - Monitor for unusual behavior from `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., network connections, file modifications outside the `OfflineFiles` directory).\n  - Check if the repeated `.js` file creation correlates with user actions (e.g., Office updates, language pack installations).\n\n**Recommendation**: If `HxTsr.exe` is not recognized or if the system is experiencing unexpected behavior, perform a malware scan and review system logs for additional context."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user gave me a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The answer has to be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be normal if someone is setting it up. But then there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like fabric_...js and bn-in-ui-strings-json...js. These look like JavaScript files, possibly part of Office add-ins or solutions. However, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. I should check if that's a legitimate process. Maybe it's part of some software, but repeated creation of files in Office's directories might be suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple entries from Explorer.EXE and EXCEL.EXE related to registry value sets and file creations. The Excel entries creating .LNK files in the Recent folder are normal, as Excel often creates shortcuts there. The registry events from Explorer and Excel might be part of normal operations, like updating settings. However, the repeated registry changes from Excel could be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys, but the logs don't specify which keys. \n\nNow, the key point is the SDXHelper.exe activity. If SDXHelper is a legitimate process, then creating those files might be okay. But if it's malware, that could be a problem. However, without more context, like the process's digital signature, parent process, or other indicators, it's hard to say. The fact that multiple files are created in Office's directories by SDXHelper might indicate some kind of injection or modification of Office solutions. Also, the .js files could be part of a malicious payload if they're not supposed to be there. \n\nBut wait, the user hasn't provided any other indicators like high entropy files, network connections, or user behavior. The logs only show file creation and registry changes. Since the user is asking if the batch is interesting, I need to see if there's enough to warrant further investigation. The presence of SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files in sensitive directories (like Microsoft Office's) could be suspicious. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nOn the other hand, the other events (like Explorer and Excel's normal operations) don't seem suspicious. So, the main concern is the SDXHelper.exe activity. But is that enough to classify the batch as interesting? Maybe. In a real-world scenario, security analysts would flag this for further investigation, like checking the process's legitimacy, checking for other malicious activities, or looking at the files' contents. \n\nSo, considering that, I think the answer is \"INTERESTING\" because the SDXHelper.exe activity is unusual and could indicate a potential security threat. However, the confidence might be moderate since there's not enough information to confirm it's malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several events that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Activity**: Multiple entries show **SDXHelper.exe** creating JavaScript files (`*.js`) in the `Microsoft Office SolutionPackages` directory. While this process is not inherently malicious, its repeated creation of files in Office-specific directories raises suspicion. These files could be part of legitimate Office add-ins, but the lack of context (e.g., digital signatures, parent process) makes this activity ambiguous and potentially indicative of tampering or injection.\n\n2. **Explorer.EXE and EXCEL.EXE Events**: The registry modifications and shortcut file creation by **Explorer.EXE** and **EXCEL.EXE** are generally normal operations. However, the high frequency of registry changes by **EXCEL.EXE** (12 entries) could hint at unusual behavior if tied to critical registry keys, though the logs do not specify this.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat.exe**: The initial file creation by **winlogbeat.exe** is likely benign if part of a legitimate log-shipping setup, but no further context is provided.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe **SDXHelper.exe activity** is the most concerning aspect, as it deviates from typical user behavior and could signal a potential threat (e.g., malicious add-in deployment). While not definitive proof of compromise, this warrants further investigation.\n\n**Answer**:  \n**INTERESTING**  \n**Justification**: Unusual file creation by SDXHelper.exe in sensitive directories and repeated registry modifications by EXCEL.EXE may indicate potential malicious activity.  \n**Confidence**: 0.7 (moderate, due to lack of additional context like process legitimacy or file content analysis)."}

The file path seems a bit unusual, especially with the long hash in the name. SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, but creating files in such a location might be part of a legitimate process, like installing add-ins or updates. However, the combination of multiple registry changes by Excel and this file creation could indicate something more.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the batch should be considered as a whole. The repeated registry events by Excel might be normal if, for example, a macro is being run or a template is loaded. However, without additional context like process IDs, user accounts, or other indicators of compromise, it's hard to tell. The file creation by SDXHelper.exe might be legitimate, but the sheer number of registry events is concerning. \n\nBut since there's no other suspicious activity like unexpected network connections, privilege escalations, or unusual process behaviors, maybe this isn't a clear case. However, the repetition of the same event multiple times (25 times for Excel) could be a sign of something automated or malicious.

The file paths are all within the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames look like they could be resource files, maybe for localization or some add-ins. But there's a lot of repetition here. The same files are being created multiple times, which might be normal if it's part of an installation or update process. However, the fact that SDXHelper.exe is doing this could be a red flag. I know that SDXHelper is sometimes associated with malware, like the TrickBot Trojan, which uses it to download additional payloads. \n\nThen there are a few events from EXPLORER.EXE related to the same directories. That might be part of normal operations, like exploring the file system. But combined with the SDXHelper activity, it's worth looking into. \n\nThe other events are about DNS queries, which are normal, but without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious. However, the main concern here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in those specific directories. Since the files are named with language codes (like cs-cz, cy-gb), they might be part of a legitimate software update, but the sheer number and repetition could indicate something else. \n\nI should also check if there are any other processes involved. The user mentioned EXPLORER.EXE and SDXHelper.exe. If there are no other suspicious processes, maybe it's a false positive. But given that SDXHelper is known in some contexts as a malicious tool, this might be a sign of an infection. \n\nHowever, without more data like network traffic or other logs, it's a bit tricky. But based on the information here, the repeated file creation by SDXHelper in those specific paths is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So, the answer would be that this is interesting and needs to be looked into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries show repeated activity from **SDXHelper.exe** creating JavaScript files in the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages** directory. While some of these files may appear to be legitimate resource files (e.g., localization strings), the **repetitive creation of files** and the **specific naming patterns** (e.g., `transcription-strings.min.js`, language-specific files like `cs-cz-ui-strings-json`) raise suspicion. \n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **SDXHelper.exe as a Potential Malware Vector**:  \n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is historically associated with malware (e.g., **TrickBot**), which uses it to download payloads or bypass security measures. Its presence in this context warrants scrutiny, especially if it is not part of a known legitimate process.\n\n2. **Unusual File Creation Patterns**:  \n   - The repeated creation of files in the `SolutionPackages` directory (e.g., `f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2`) suggests **unusual behavior** for a legitimate software update or installation. This could indicate **malicious activity**, such as downloading and executing payloads.\n\n3. **Lack of Context for Legitimacy**:  \n   - There is no clear indication (e.g., process ownership, signed binaries, or user interaction) that these activities are part of a legitimate Microsoft Office update or add-in installation.\n\n### Conclusion:  \n**This log batch is suspicious and merits further investigation**.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The first thing I notice is that all the events are the same process creating files, and the files are all .js files named with language codes and hashes.\n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe... I'm not entirely sure what that process is, but I know that some legitimate software uses similar names. However, the fact that it's creating so many JavaScript files in the Office directory might be suspicious. Office typically doesn't need to generate a lot of JS files in that location, especially with those naming patterns. The hashes in the filenames look like they could be random, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual content.\n\nWait, but maybe this is part of a legitimate update or some add-in? However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files in quick succession could indicate something malicious. Malware often creates files in system directories to hide or persist. Also, the use of language codes might be a red herring, trying to make it look like it's related to localization, but that's not typical for Office's normal operations.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. Let me think... I don't recall it being a standard Microsoft process. Maybe it's part of a third-party application, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, given the pattern of file creation and the location, this does raise a flag. The sheer number of files created by the same process might be indicative of a dropper or a downloader, which is common in malware.\n\nAnother point is the lack of any other processes or events in the logs. All entries are about file creation by SDXHelper.exe. That's a bit unusual. If this were a normal operation, there might be other related events, like registry changes or network activity. But since the user only provided these logs, it's hard to tell. Still, the pattern here is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, while not definitive proof, the repetitive creation of JavaScript files by an unfamiliar process in a system directory is suspicious and could be a sign of malicious activity. It's advisable to check the integrity of the SDXHelper.exe process, maybe through antivirus scans or checking its digital signature, and monitor for any other unusual activities.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Provided Logs:**\n\nThe logs indicate repeated file creation events by the `SDXHelper.exe` process, generating JavaScript (`.js`) files in the `Microsoft Office` directory (`SolutionPackages`). Here's a breakdown of the key observations and implications:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Findings:**\n1. **Process and File Pattern:**\n   - **Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` (not a standard Microsoft process; not widely recognized as legitimate).\n   - **Files Created:** Multiple `.js` files with names like `en-us-ui-strings-json_<hash>.js`, `es-es-ui-strings-json_<hash>.js`, etc. The filenames include language codes (e.g., `en-us`, `es-es`) and random-looking hashes.\n\n2. **Location of Files:**\n   - Files are created in `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...`, a directory typically associated with Office add-ins, templates, or updates. However, **generating numerous `.js` files here is unusual** for legitimate Office operations.\n\n3. **Repetition and Volume:**\n   - Over **15+ identical file-creation events** are logged. This repetitive behavior is suspicious and could indicate automated activity (e.g., a dropper or downloader).\n\n4. **Lack of Context:**\n   - No other logs (e.g., network activity, registry changes, or process execution) are provided, making it harder to confirm if this is part of a larger malicious chain.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Unusual Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` is not a known legitimate Microsoft process. Its presence may indicate a rogue application or malware.\n- **File Naming:** The use of language codes and hashes in filenames could be an attempt to mimic legitimate localization files, masking malicious intent.\n- **Directory Involvement:** Writing to the Office directory may be an attempt to exploit trust in Microsoft's ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy:**\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (if present) and ensure it matches a trusted publisher.\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to analyze the process.\n\n2. **Scan for Malware:**\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/antimalware software (e.g., Windows Defender, Kaspersky, Bitdefender).\n\n3. **Monitor Network Activity:**\n   - Check if `SDXHelper.exe` is communicating with external IPs or domains (use tools like Wireshark or Microsoft Defender Network Monitor).\n\n4. **Isolate and Investigate:**\n   - If `SDXHelper.exe` is confirmed malicious, isolate the affected system and remove the file. Investigate for persistence mechanisms (e.g., registry entries, scheduled tasks).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile not definitive proof of malware, the repetitive creation of `.js` files by an unfamiliar process in a sensitive directory raises **strong suspicion of malicious activity**. Further investigation is warranted to confirm whether this is part of a broader threat."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The task is to look at all the events together and decide if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, they all have the same process name: SDXHelper.exe. That's a bit odd because if it's a legitimate process, maybe it's part of some software that's creating a lot of files. But then again, if it's malware, it might be using that process to generate a lot of files in different directories.\n\nNext, looking at the file paths, they're all in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames are things like \"es-es-ui-strings-json_...\" which might be language-specific files. But wait, the hashes at the end of the filenames are different each time. That could be normal if they're different language files, but maybe they're just random files being created here. However, the fact that there are multiple entries with the same hash in different directories might be a red flag. For example, the first entry has \"36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b\" and then later entries have \"f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2\" and others. But wait, looking closer, some of the same hashes are repeated. Like \"36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b\" appears multiple times with different filenames. That might be normal if they're different files under the same package, but maybe not.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the filenames end with \".js\" which is JavaScript. If these are legitimate Office files, maybe they're part of some add-ins or resources. But creating multiple JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages directory might not be typical. Also, the fact that the same process is creating all these files could be a sign of something malicious, especially if it's generating a lot of files with unique hashes, which might be part of a payload or data exfiltration.\n\nWait, but maybe SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. I should check if that's a known process. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is associated with some software, but not sure if it's part of Microsoft Office. If it's not a standard process, that could be suspicious. However, without knowing the system context, it's hard to say. But given that all these files are being created in the Office directory, maybe it's part of an Office add-on or something similar. However, the repetition of the same package ID with different files might indicate that the process is generating a lot of files, which could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nAlso, looking at the structure of the filenames, they all seem to follow a pattern: language code (like es-es, fi-fi) followed by \"-ui-strings-json\" and a hash. That might be a standard naming convention for some resources, but if the hash is random, that could be a way to obfuscate the files. However, if the same package ID is used with different filenames, maybe that's part of a legitimate update or installation process.\n\nBut considering the number of events, there are multiple entries for the same package ID with different filenames, and others with different package IDs. It's possible that this is part of a normal software update, but the fact that all these files are being created by the same process might be suspicious. Alternatively, if the system is infected with malware that's using SDXHelper.exe as a dropper, creating these files as part of its operation.\n\nAnother angle: the fact that all the files are JavaScript. If they're being created in the Office directory, maybe they're part of some malicious script that's being injected into Office documents. However, without seeing the content of the files, it's hard to tell. But the sheer number of files being created by the same process could be a sign of something wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while some of this could be legitimate, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files with varying hashes and language codes in a specific directory might be worth investigating further. It's not a clear-cut case of malware, but the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant looking into it more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided JSON events indicate a series of file creation activities by the **SDXHelper.exe** process within the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages** directory. Here's a structured analysis of the key observations and their implications:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Repetitive Process Name**:\n   - All events are attributed to **SDXHelper.exe**, a process not typically associated with core Microsoft Office operations. While it may be a legitimate component of third-party software, its involvement in creating numerous files warrants scrutiny.\n\n2. **File Naming Pattern**:\n   - Files are named with a **language code** (e.g., `es-es`, `fr-ca`) followed by `-ui-strings-json` and a **unique hash** (e.g., `36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b`). This pattern suggests:\n     - **Localization**: The files might be language-specific resources (e.g., UI strings for different locales).\n     - **Obfuscation**: The use of unique hashes could obscure the file's true purpose or content.\n\n3. **Directory Structure**:\n   - Files are created in the **`SolutionPackages`** directory, which is typically used by Microsoft Office for storing add-ins or temporary resources. However, the volume and repetitive nature of the files may indicate **unauthorized activity**.\n\n4. **Repetition of Hashes**:\n   - The same package ID (e.g., `36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b`) appears multiple times with different filenames, suggesting **multiple files under the same package**. This could be normal for updates but raises concerns if the files are unrelated or malicious.\n\n5. **File Type**:\n   - The `.js` extension indicates **JavaScript files**, which could be legitimate (e.g., scripts for Office add-ins) or malicious (e.g., embedded payloads).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Unusual Activity**: The repetitive creation of files by a single process in a sensitive directory may indicate **malware** using `SDXHelper.exe` as a dropper or persistence mechanism.\n- **Lack of Context**: Without additional information (e.g., system logs, file content, or user behavior), it's challenging to confirm whether this is legitimate or malicious.\n- **Hash Analysis**: The unique hashes could be used to **evade detection** by security tools, though this is speculative without further analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify SDXHelper.exe Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` and ensure it is associated with a trusted vendor.\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to analyze the process.\n\n2. **Inspect File Content**:\n   - Examine the contents of the `.js` files to determine if they contain legitimate code or malicious payloads (e.g., obfuscated scripts, URLs, or commands).\n\n3. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Look for **unusual network activity**, elevated privileges, or changes to system files that could indicate tampering.\n\n4. **Check for Updates**:\n   - Ensure Microsoft Office and the system are up to date, as outdated software may be exploited by malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the activity could be **legitimate** (e.g., a software update or localization process), the repetitive nature of the file creation, the use of `.js` files in a sensitive directory, and the lack of clear context **warrant further investigation**. If `SDXHelper.exe` is not a known, trusted component, this behavior may indicate **malicious activity**."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a file creation event. The process involved is mostly SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Microsoft Office Solution Packages. The files being created are all UI string JSON files in various languages, like fr-fr, ga-ie, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if these events are suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, part of Office, so creating files in the Office solution package directory might be normal. However, the fact that there are so many files being created, each with different language codes, could be a red flag. It might indicate that something is generating a lot of files, possibly malware trying to drop its own files.\n\nWait, but looking at the paths, they're all under the Office Solution Packages directory. That's a standard location for such files. Also, the filenames follow a pattern: language codes followed by \"-ui-strings-json\" and a hash. That seems like it could be part of a legitimate update or localization process. However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files might be normal if it's part of an installation or update.\n\nBut then there's the last event, which is from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for logging, but creating a new configuration file in the Downloads folder might be unusual. It could be part of a setup process, but if this is unexpected, it might be a sign of something else.\n\nHowever, without more context, like other events or indicators of compromise, it's hard to say. The majority of events are from SDXHelper.exe in a legitimate path. The key here is that the user is asking if this is suspicious. Since all the events are from known processes in standard locations, and there's no obvious malicious activity (like execution, network traffic, etc.), it might not be a security threat. But the high number of file creations could be worth investigating further, maybe checking if there's an ongoing update or if the system is being used for something unexpected.\n\nAnother angle: the filenames have unique hashes. If these are all part of a legitimate update, that's fine. But if they're being generated by a malicious process, the hashes might be part of a payload. However, without knowing what the hashes correspond to, it's hard to tell. Also, the fact that the same process is creating multiple files might be normal for a setup or installation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the volume of events might be unusual, the processes involved are legitimate, and the paths are standard. Unless there are other indicators (like unexpected network activity, changes in system behavior, etc.), this might not be a security incident. But it's worth monitoring and possibly checking the integrity of the files created.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided events involve multiple file creation activities, primarily by **SDXHelper.exe** (a legitimate Microsoft Office process) and **winlogbeat.exe** (a log shipper tool). Here's a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creations**:\n   - **Location**: Files are created in the Office Solution Packages directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Wef\\...`).\n   - **Filenames**: The files follow a pattern: `xx-xx-ui-strings-json_<hash>.js`, where `xx-xx` represents language codes (e.g., `fr-fr`, `he-il`).\n   - **Purpose**: These files appear to be **localization\/resource files** for Office applications, possibly part of an update or installation process. The use of language codes and `.js` extensions aligns with standard Office localization practices.\n\n2. **winlogbeat.exe Activity**:\n   - A single event shows **winlogbeat.exe** creating a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`).\n   - **Context**: This could be part of a **configuration setup** for Winlogbeat (a legitimate tool for collecting and shipping logs). However, the location (`Downloads`) is unusual for a configuration file, which might warrant further investigation.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Suspicious?**\n- **SDXHelper.exe Activity**:\n  - **Likely Benign**: The process and file paths are consistent with legitimate Office operations. The repetition of file creation may be due to **language-specific updates** or **resource packaging**.\n  - **Red Flags**: The high volume of files and unique hashes could indicate **unusual behavior** if not tied to a known Office update. However, without additional context (e.g., network activity, process anomalies), this is speculative.\n\n- **winlogbeat.exe Activity**:\n  - **Potentially Suspicious**: While Winlogbeat is legitimate, the creation of a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory is **unusual**. This could indicate:\n    - A **malicious configuration** being written (e.g., if the file was downloaded from an untrusted source).\n    - A **legitimate setup** error (e.g., misconfigured paths).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Office Updates**:\n   - Check if the user has recently installed Office updates or localized versions. Confirm that the files match expected update packages.\n\n2. **Investigate Winlogbeat Configuration**:\n   - Examine the `.yml.new` file to determine its contents. Ensure it aligns with a legitimate Winlogbeat configuration and that the file was not tampered with.\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Look for other suspicious activities (e.g., unexpected network connections, process injections) that might correlate with these file creations.\n\n4. **File Integrity Checks**:\n   - Use tools like **Microsoft Defender** or **SIEM** systems to verify the integrity of the created files and ensure they match known good hashes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe majority of the activity (**SDXHelper.exe** file creations) is **likely legitimate**, assuming it corresponds to an Office update or localization process. The **winlogbeat.exe** event requires closer scrutiny to rule out misconfiguration or malicious activity. **No definitive malicious indicators** are present, but further investigation into the Winlogbeat file and system context is advised."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating various JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The first thing I notice is that all the files are .js files, and they have names that seem to be related to icons and UI strings for different languages, like hr-hr, id-id, is-is, etc. \n\nNow, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior or if it's something suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, right? It's involved in handling solution packages, maybe for add-ins or customizations. So, creating these files might be part of the normal operation when deploying or updating an add-in.\n\nBut wait, the files are all being created in the PackageResources folder under SolutionPackages. That directory is typically used for storing resources related to Office solutions. The names of the files include language codes (like hr-hr, id-id) and references to icons and UI strings. That makes sense if the solution is internationalized, needing different language files. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be a red flag. Are these files being created multiple times as part of a normal process, or is this an indication of something like a loop or malicious activity?\n\nAlso, looking at the file names, they have unique hashes or identifiers, which is common for resources to avoid conflicts. But if the same file is being created multiple times with the same name and hash, that might not be normal. However, in the logs provided, each entry seems to be a separate file with different names, so maybe they are different resources. \n\nAnother angle: SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's creating a large number of files, especially if they're not part of a known Office add-in, that could be concerning. However, the user hasn't mentioned any other symptoms like high CPU usage, unexpected network activity, or other signs of malware. \n\nThe logs don't show any errors or unusual events, just the creation of files. Since all the files are .js and located in a standard directory for Office solutions, this might be part of a legitimate add-in deployment. However, without more context, like the user's environment, whether they installed new software, or if there are other logs indicating malicious activity, it's hard to be certain.\n\nIn summary, while the activity could be normal for SDXHelper.exe when handling Office add-ins, the repetitive creation of multiple files might warrant further investigation. Checking if there's an associated Office add-in, reviewing the files' contents if possible, and ensuring that the process is indeed legitimate would be the next steps. But based solely on the logs provided, it's leaning towards being a normal operation rather than malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that **SDXHelper.exe** (a legitimate Microsoft Office process) is creating JavaScript files in the `PackageResources` directory under `SolutionPackages`. These files appear to be **language-specific UI strings and icon resources** for Office add-ins or solutions, as suggested by the filenames (e.g., `hr-hr`, `id-id`, `is-is`).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Legitimate Process**:  \n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is part of Microsoft Office and is involved in managing solution packages (e.g., add-ins, customizations).  \n   - The file creation aligns with typical behavior when deploying or updating Office solutions that require localized resources or icons.\n\n2. **File Naming and Structure**:  \n   - Filenames include language codes (e.g., `hr-hr`, `id-id`) and unique hashes, which is common for resource files to avoid conflicts.  \n   - The files are stored in the expected `PackageResources\/OfflineFiles` subdirectory, which is used for Office solution assets.\n\n3. **No Immediate Red Flags**:  \n   - The logs show no errors, unexpected processes, or anomalies.  \n   - The repetitive entries may reflect **normal deployment workflows** (e.g., creating multiple language-specific files during a package update).\n\n### Potential Concerns (if not already addressed):\n- **Unusual Volume**: If the number of files created is significantly higher than expected for a legitimate add-in, further investigation is warranted (e.g., checking for malicious payloads disguised as resource files).  \n- **Unrecognized Add-ins**: If the user has not installed Office add-ins or solutions, this activity could indicate a **compromise** (e.g., malware masquerading as a legitimate process).\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Verify Add-in Sources**: Ensure that any Office add-ins or solutions are from trusted sources.  \n- **Scan for Malware**: Run a full system scan using updated antivirus\/antimalware tools to rule out malicious activity.  \n- **Monitor Behavior**: Check for unusual network activity, high CPU\/disk usage, or unexpected modifications to Office directories.  \n- **Review File Contents**: If possible, inspect the generated `.js` files for suspicious code (e.g., obfuscation, unexpected API calls).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe activity is **likely legitimate** for a standard Office solution deployment. However, **context is critical**—if the user has not installed related add-ins or if other suspicious behavior is observed, further investigation is necessary."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to analyze the entire batch together.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific paths under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like \"it-it-ui-strings-json...\" and similar patterns with different language codes. The same file paths are repeated multiple times, which might be a red flag. But wait, maybe it's just normal activity? Office sometimes installs language packs or updates, which could involve creating these files. However, the repetition might indicate something else.\n\nThen there are some events involving EXCEL.EXE doing DNS queries and registry changes, and svchost.exe making registry modifications. These could be normal operations, but combined with the file creations, maybe there's a pattern. However, the key point here is that the majority of the logs are about SDXHelper.exe creating these JS files in the Office directory. \n\nWait, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process related to Office, but if it's creating a lot of files with similar names, maybe it's part of a malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The fact that the same file is logged multiple times might just be redundant entries, or maybe the process is being monitored closely. Also, the last entry has a process of null and task None, which might be an error or a placeholder.\n\nBut considering the repetition of the same file creation events, that's unusual. Typically, you'd expect a file to be created once unless there's a loop or repeated action. However, without seeing the timestamps or more details, it's hard to tell if they're spread out over time or all clustered. \n\nAnother angle: the registry events from svchost.exe and EXCEL.EXE could be normal, but combined with the file creations, it's possible that there's some malicious activity. However, I need to be cautious. Maybe this is just a normal update or installation process. \n\nBut the key here is that the majority of the logs are about SDXHelper.exe creating these JS files. If this is a known benign process, then it might not be a concern. However, if SDXHelper.exe is involved in something malicious, then these files could be part of that. Since I don't have information on whether SDXHelper.exe is compromised here, it's a bit of a toss-up.\n\nBut given that the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, the repetition of the same file creation events by the same process might be worth looking into. It's not necessarily a clear sign of malware, but it's unusual enough that it could be a point of interest. The presence of registry changes and DNS queries might be part of a larger attack, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nSo, I think the answer is that this is interesting enough to warrant further investigation. The repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory, along with other process activities, could indicate either normal operations or something more sinister. It's not a definitive sign of a security issue, but the pattern is notable and should be looked into.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation due to the following observations:\n\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by SDXHelper.exe**:  \n   Multiple entries show `SDXHelper.exe` creating files with names like `xx-xx-ui-strings-json_...js` in the `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. While `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate component of Microsoft Office (used for managing add-ins and updates), the **repetition of identical file creation events** (e.g., the same file path logged multiple times) is unusual. This could indicate either:\n   - **Normal activity** (e.g., repeated updates or language pack installations), or  \n   - **Anomalous behavior** (e.g., a loop, unauthorized file generation, or malicious payload delivery).\n\n2. **Registry and DNS Activity**:  \n   - `EXCEL.EXE` and `svchost.exe` are involved in **registry modifications** and **DNS queries**. While these processes are legitimate, the combination with the file-creation events raises questions about potential **coordinated activity** (e.g., persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration, or command-and-control communication).\n\n3. **Null Entries and Ambiguity**:  \n   The final entry (`process: null, winlog: None`) suggests a possible **incomplete or malformed log**, which could obscure context or indicate a system-level issue (e.g., logging failures).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:  \nWhile the logs alone do not definitively prove malicious intent, the **repetitive file-creation pattern** and **unusual process interactions** are **suspicious enough to warrant investigation**. Further analysis would include:  \n- Checking timestamps to determine if events are spread out (normal) or clustered (anomalous).  \n- Correlating the files with known benign Office components or malware signatures.  \n- Investigating the registry changes and DNS queries for signs of persistence or external communication.  \n\n**Recommendation**: Treat this as a **low-to-medium priority alert** for further forensic analysis."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first entry is a bit odd because the process and file fields are null, and the winlog task is \"None\". Not sure what that's about, but maybe it's just a placeholder or an error. \n\nThen there are two entries where the process is SDXHelper.exe creating a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path looks a bit suspicious. Office apps usually don't generate files in SolutionPackages, especially with names like ko-kr-ui-strings-json. Maybe it's a malicious file being dropped? But I need to check more.\n\nAfter that, there are 23 entries all from EXCEL.EXE with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". So Excel is modifying the registry a lot. That's not normal. Excel typically doesn't change registry values unless it's part of a legitimate update or configuration. But 23 times? That seems excessive. Could be a sign of malware trying to persist or alter system settings.\n\nPutting it together: SDXHelper.exe creating a file in an unusual location and Excel modifying the registry repeatedly. Both are suspicious. However, without more context like the file's content, user actions, or other processes, it's hard to be certain.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first seven entries are all about EXCEL.EXE performing registry value sets. That's a lot of registry changes from Excel. Now, Excel is a legitimate application, but making multiple registry changes could be suspicious. However, sometimes Excel might modify the registry for its own purposes, like updating settings or add-ins.\n\nThen, starting from the eighth event, there's SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JavaScript files in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The filenames are things like \"kok-in-ui-strings-json\" and \"transcription-strings.min.js\". These look like localization files or UI strings. But the path includes \"SolutionPackages\" which is part of Office's structure for add-ins or solutions. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. If not, that's a red flag. However, the files being created are in expected locations for Office solutions, and the names suggest they're part of a package's resources. \n\nBut wait, the fact that there are multiple files created by SDXHelper.exe in different language-specific folders might indicate that this is part of a legitimate Office add-in deployment. However, the combination of multiple registry changes by Excel and the creation of these files could be part of a larger process, maybe an update or installation. \n\nAlternatively, if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, this could be malicious. But given that the files are in the Office SolutionPackages directory, it's possible that this is related to a legitimate Office add-on or update. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe key points here are the repeated registry modifications by Excel and the creation of multiple files by SDXHelper.exe. If SDXHelper.exe is not known, that's suspicious. But if it's part of a legitimate Office solution, then maybe not. Since the user hasn't provided more info on SDXHelper.exe, I have to go with the data given. \n\nConsidering that, the events might be part of a legitimate process, but the combination of registry changes and file creation by non-standard processes could be worth investigating further. However, without more evidence, it's not conclusive. So, the answer is that the events are suspicious but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve two distinct processes: **EXCEL.EXE** performing multiple registry modifications and **SDXHelper.exe** creating numerous JavaScript files in specific directories under Microsoft Office's `SolutionPackages` folder. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **EXCEL.EXE Registry Modifications**:\n   - **Frequency**: Seven repeated registry value sets by Excel.\n   - **Legitimacy**: While Excel can modify the registry (e.g., for add-ins or configuration), **frequent or unusual registry changes** may indicate tampering or malicious activity. However, this alone is not conclusive.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation**:\n   - **Process**: **SDXHelper.exe** is not a standard Microsoft process. Its presence raises suspicion, as it is not typically associated with Office operations.\n   - **Files Created**: JavaScript files named `*.min.js` and language-specific UI strings (e.g., `kok-in-ui-strings-json`, `transcription-strings.min.js`) are placed in `SolutionPackages` directories. These paths and filenames resemble **Office add-in or localization package resources**, but the use of `SDXHelper.exe` is uncharacteristic of legitimate Office operations.\n\n### Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):\n- **Unusual Process**: `SDXHelper.exe` is not a known legitimate Microsoft process. Its involvement in file creation may indicate **malware or a rogue add-in**.\n- **File Placement**: While the directory structure aligns with Office solutions, the **combination of SDXHelper.exe and non-standard filenames** (e.g., `transcription-strings.min.js`) may suggest **malicious activity** (e.g., injecting malicious scripts into Office resources).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe events are **suspicious** and warrant further investigation. While the file paths and filenames could align with legitimate Office operations, **the use of SDXHelper.exe** and the **volume of registry changes by Excel** suggest potential **malicious behavior** (e.g., a compromised add-in or malware). \n\n**Recommendation**: \n- Verify the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., check digital signatures, process tree, and network activity).\n- Analyze the created JavaScript files for malicious content (e.g., obfuscation, external requests).\n- Monitor for additional anomalous activity related to Excel or Office processes."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a log event. The main thing here is to look for patterns or anomalies that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. Most of the events are from SDXHelper.exe, which I think is related to Microsoft Office, maybe part of the setup or some helper tool. But there's also one event from Excel.exe, which is normal. Then there's a mention of a registry key modification by the Office Click-to-Run setup, which might be part of a legitimate installation. However, the user is asking if this is suspicious.\n\nNext, the file paths. The files being created are all in the Office installation directory, specifically under \"Click2Run\" and \"Office16\" folders. The file names are long and include random strings, which could be normal for some setup files, but sometimes malware uses similar naming to blend in. However, the presence of .exe files in the \"Office16\" folder might be a red flag because typically, Office installations don't put executable files there. Legitimate files might be .cab or .msi, but .exe could be suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the registry key modification. The key being changed is related to the Office installation, which could be part of a legitimate update or installation process. However, if this is happening without user consent or in an unexpected context, it might be a sign of something malicious. But without more context, like the source of the update or any other suspicious activities, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe user also mentioned that the registry key is being modified by the Office Click-to-Run setup. That's a known legitimate process, so that might be normal. However, if the system is not expecting an Office update, or if there are other signs of compromise, that could be a problem.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple file creations in the Office directory, registry changes. If this is part of a legitimate Office installation or update, then it's normal. But if the user didn't initiate an Office update, or if there are other indicators like unexpected network activity, unusual processes, or if the files are not signed by Microsoft, that would be concerning.\n\nIn the absence of other suspicious activities, this might just be a standard Office setup. However, the presence of .exe files in the Office16 folder could still be a point of concern. I should check if that's a common occurrence. From what I remember, Office installations typically use .msi or .cab files, so .exe might be unusual. But maybe in some cases, they do use .exe for certain components.\n\nAnother angle: the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times. Each entry seems to be a separate event, but if the same file is being created multiple times, that might indicate something like a loop or a failed installation process. However, looking at the data provided, each event has a different file name, so that's not the case here.\n\nAlso, the lack of any other processes or activities mentioned. If this is the only thing happening, it's more likely legitimate. But if this is part of a larger set of events that include other suspicious activities, that would change the assessment.\n\nConsidering all this, the key points are the presence of .exe files in the Office directory and the registry modification. If these are part of a known legitimate process, then it's not suspicious. But if there's no clear context or if the files are not signed, it could be a red flag. Since the user hasn't provided more context, I have to make an educated guess based on the available data.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries involve multiple file creations and a registry modification by **SDXHelper.exe** (likely part of Microsoft Office's Click-to-Run setup). Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Process Context**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a known component of Microsoft Office installations and updates, particularly for Click-to-Run deployments. The activity appears to be related to **Office 2016** (e.g., `Office16` directory, `.js` files in `Click2Run`).\n   - The **registry modification** (`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office`...) is consistent with Office installation\/update processes.\n\n2. **File Creation Patterns**:\n   - Files are created in the Office installation directory (`C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office16\\`) and are named with seemingly random strings (e.g., `mi-1601620609.js`, `14.0.4762.1000.js`). These may be **configuration or update scripts**.\n   - The presence of `.js` files is typical for Office setup scripts and not inherently suspicious.\n\n3. **Potential Red Flags**:\n   - **.exe Files in Office16**: One event involves creating a `.exe` file (`Office16\\14.0.4762.1000.exe`). While not necessarily malicious, this is **unusual** for standard Office installations, which typically use `.msi`, `.cab`, or `.xml` files. This could indicate:\n     - A **custom or third-party installer**.\n     - **Malware masquerading as Office components** (if the file lacks proper digital signatures or is not part of a known Office update).\n\n4. **Lack of Context**:\n   - No mention of user-initiated Office updates, unexpected network activity, or other anomalies (e.g., unauthorized processes, unexpected services) is provided. Without further context, it’s difficult to confirm malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\n- **Likely Legitimate**: The activity aligns with **Microsoft Office installation\/update processes** and is consistent with known behavior of `SDXHelper.exe`.\n- **Potential Concerns**: The `.exe` file creation in the `Office16` directory is **unusual** and warrants further investigation (e.g., verifying file integrity, digital signatures, and correlating with other system logs).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Verify File Authenticity**:\n   - Check the digital signature of the `.exe` file (right-click > Properties > Digital Signatures). It should be signed by **Microsoft Corporation**.\n   - Use tools like **VirusTotal** to scan the file for malware.\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Look for other suspicious activities (e.g., unexpected network connections, unauthorized registry changes, or processes running under non-Office contexts).\n\n3. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - If this is part of a larger event (e.g., a ransomware attack or phishing-induced installation), additional logs (e.g., network traffic, process tree, user activity) would be critical to confirm legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n**Final Verdict**: **Likely legitimate**, but the `.exe` file creation should be **investigated further** to rule out compromise."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look at these events. So, there are three entries here, all from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. Each one is a file creation event under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files being created are all UI string JSON files with different language codes, like nb-no and ne-np.\n\nHmm, first thought: SDXHelper.exe isn't a process I recognize off the top of my head. Maybe it's part of a legitimate software, but I'm not sure. The fact that it's creating files in the Office SolutionPackages folder is interesting. That directory is typically used by Office for add-ins or solutions, so maybe this is related to an Office add-in installation.\n\nBut wait, why are there three entries? Two of them have the same file path. That might be a mistake in the log, or maybe the process is creating the same file multiple times. That could indicate an issue, like a loop or an error in the file creation process.\n\nLooking at the file names, they are all UI string resources. Those are usually part of localization files for applications. If this is a legitimate Office add-in, then creating these files might be normal. However, the presence of multiple entries for the same file might not be normal. Also, the process name SDXHelper.exe isn't something I commonly see in Office's context. I should check if that's a known process or a potential malware.\n\nAnother angle: the user is fiddelis. If this is a user account that's not typically used for administrative tasks, maybe that's a red flag. But without more context on the user's role, it's hard to say.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. If all these events are part of a legitimate installation, then it's not interesting. But the repetition and the unknown process name make me think there's something off. However, without more data like other process activities, network connections, or user behavior, it's hard to be certain. So maybe the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, but I'm not entirely sure. The justification would be the unusual process name and the repetitive file creation in a specific directory.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory by an uncommon process (SDXHelper.exe), which may indicate abnormal behavior or potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
