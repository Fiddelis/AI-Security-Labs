{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Wait, those are legitimate system DLLs, so that's normal. But then there's a rundll32.exe command line that's a bit odd. The command line includes a GUID and -Embedding. That might be a red flag because sometimes malicious software uses rundll32 with unusual parameters. But I need to check if this is a known legitimate use case. Maybe not, so that's a point to note.\n\nThen there's svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be part of its normal operation. But the user might be concerned if there's unexpected activity. However, the logs don't show any errors here.\n\nThe EXCEL.EXE process is loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Amsi is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV is from Windows Defender as well. That seems legitimate because Excel might need these for security checks. But wait, why is Excel loading so many system DLLs? Maybe that's normal, but sometimes malware uses similar techniques. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother point is the repeated entries about User Account Management. But those entries don't have process names or files, so they might be benign. Also, the WmiPrvSE.exe process is involved in WMI activities, which can be used by malware, but again, it's a legitimate process.\n\nThe main suspicious thing here is the rundll32.exe command with the GUID. That might be a sign of something malicious, but I need to check if that's a known legitimate action. If not, that could be a reason to flag this as interesting. However, without more context or other suspicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. The other events don't show clear signs of compromise. So, maybe the confidence is moderate. The classification would be \"INTERESTING\" because there's at least one event that's potentially suspicious, even if others are normal.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple ImageLoad events for SDXHelper.exe loading legitimate system DLLs (combase.dll, urlmon.dll) combined with a suspicious rundll32.exe command line involving a GUID and -Embedding parameter, which is often associated with malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each line and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events here have the task \"User Account Management\" under winlog, and process and file are null. That might be normal system activity, but not necessarily suspicious. However, there are a few entries that stand out. Let me check those.\n\nLooking at the 7th event: process is EXCEL.EXE, task is \"Image loaded\" with the file path pointing to C:\\Windows\\System32\\coml2.dll. Wait, coml2.dll is a legitimate Windows system file, right? But why is Excel loading it? Maybe that's normal, but sometimes attackers might use legitimate processes to load malicious DLLs. Hmm, not sure yet. Need to check more.\n\nThen there are events where EXCEL.EXE is performing DNS queries. Multiple DNS queries from Excel might be normal if it's accessing external resources, but if it's querying suspicious domains, that could be a red flag. However, the logs don't mention the domains here. So maybe not enough info, but repeated DNS queries could be part of command and control communication.\n\nAnother event shows a file created by EXCEL.EXE: \"real_values.csv.LNK\" in the Recent folder. A .LNK file is a shortcut. Creating a shortcut in the Recent folder might be part of normal user activity, but if it's being created by Excel, maybe it's a way to execute something else. However, without more context, like the shortcut pointing to a malicious file, it's hard to tell. But the presence of a shortcut in the Recent folder could indicate user interaction, or maybe an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nNow, looking at the other entries, most are \"None\" tasks, which might just be noise. But the key here is the combination of events. The fact that Excel is involved in multiple activities: loading a DLL, creating a shortcut, and making DNS queries. If these events are happening in a short time frame, it could be part of a malicious process. However, without more context like the user's normal behavior, it's tricky.\n\nWait, the classification needs to be based on the entire batch. The presence of multiple DNS queries from Excel, along with creating a shortcut, might be suspicious. Even though some components are legitimate, the combination could indicate something unusual. Also, the image loaded event might be normal, but if coml2.dll is being loaded from an unexpected location or by an unexpected process, that's a problem. However, the path here is the system32 directory, which is standard.\n\nI'm a bit torn. On one hand, the majority of events are normal user account management. On the other, the Excel-related events might be part of a benign activity, like a user working on a spreadsheet that's accessing external resources. But without more details on the domains or the contents of the shortcut, it's hard to be certain. However, the fact that there are multiple DNS queries and a file creation might be worth investigating further. So maybe the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence because the combination of events could indicate potential malicious activity, even if not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple EXCEL.EXE processes performing DNS queries and creating a .LNK file in the Recent directory, which may indicate suspicious user behavior or potential malware activity. The image load event for a legitimate system DLL (coml2.dll) is less concerning but combined with other events raises moderate suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
