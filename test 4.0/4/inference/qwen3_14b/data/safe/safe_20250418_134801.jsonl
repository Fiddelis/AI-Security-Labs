Not sure if that's suspicious yet. Then a bunch of User Account Management events, which might be normal system activity. The services.exe logons and Special Logon events could be part of regular system operations.\n\nThe PowerShell command line is interesting.

That's a legitimate process, part of Elastic's Winlogbeat, which is used for log collection. The file path seems normal, maybe part of a configuration. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there are several svchost.exe entries. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, so seeing it create files or set registry values isn't unusual. But I should check if there's any pattern. For example, multiple registry value sets might be normal, but maybe in combination with other events?\n\nThe Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal. Urlmon is part of Internet Explorer, so that's expected. No issues there.\n\nNext, chrome.exe setting a registry value. Chrome often modifies the registry, so that's probably normal user activity. Not a red flag.\n\nMsMpEng.exe is Windows Defender's process. Loading taskschd.dll is normal, as that's part of the Task Scheduler. Also, CompatTelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll might be related to compatibility telemetry. Still normal.\n\nThen, svchost.exe creating files in the DeliveryOptimization cache. That's part of Windows Update and Delivery Optimization, which is standard. The file paths here are typical for system processes.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating a file in the Program Files directory. That's expected during an update. However, there's a File Delete logged event for a temporary file. That's normal cleanup, so nothing wrong there.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe is part of Windows Defender as well. Loading MpClient.dll and creating a lock file in Temp are normal operations. The lock file is likely for temporary use during an update or scan.\n\nLooking at other processes like conhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values. Conhost is related to console windows, and mintty is a terminal emulator. If mintty is setting registry values, maybe that's part of user activity, but unless there's an unusual command line or unexpected action, it's not suspicious.\n\nNow, checking for any anomalies. All processes are legitimate system or user applications. The events include normal operations like file creation, registry changes, and image loading. No unexpected processes, no unusual file paths, no signs of privilege escalation, no network activity mentioned. The only thing that stands out is the winlogbeat file creation, but that's part of a legitimate tool. \n\nHowever, the presence of multiple registry changes by svchost and other processes might be normal.

These are all standard files from the semver package, which is a common npm package for versioning. The fact that git is creating these files during a clone or install makes sense.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. The user provided a bunch of JSON log entries, all related to files being created by git.exe in the node_modules\/semver directory. The task is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on. All the events are \"File created\" with the rule FileCreate. The process is git.exe, and the files are in a specific path under node_modules\/semver. The files mentioned are various functions and internal files of the semver package, which is a versioning library commonly used in npm packages.\n\nNow, considering that git.exe is creating these files. Normally, when you clone a repository or install dependencies with npm, git might be involved, but typically it's the package manager that handles file creation. However, if these files are being created by git.exe, that might be unusual. But wait, maybe it's part of a normal operation. For example, if someone is using git to manage a project that includes node_modules, but usually, git doesn't create the node_modules directory itself. That's usually done by npm or yarn.\n\nAnother angle: the semver package is a legitimate package, so the files listed are part of a standard npm package. If these files are being created as part of a normal installation, then it's not suspicious. However, if git.exe is creating them in a context where it shouldn't be, like if the user is not running an npm install or git clone, that could be a red flag.\n\nBut looking at the paths, they are all under the Downloads folder, which is common for user-installed packages. The user might be working on a project and cloning a repo that has semver as a dependency. However, git.exe creating individual files in node_modules might not be standard. Typically, git handles version control, not the actual file creation in node_modules. That's usually handled by the package manager.\n\nWait, maybe the user is using git to track changes in the node_modules directory, which is not common. However, it's possible, though not typical. Alternatively, if the files are being created in a non-standard location or if there's an unusual number of files being created, that might be suspicious. But in this case, the files are all part of a legitimate package.\n\nAnother consideration: are there any signs of malicious activity? For example, if the files were created by an unexpected process or if there were errors or unusual permissions. But in the given logs, the process is git.exe, which is a legitimate process. The files are standard ones from semver. There's no mention of any errors or unusual activity in the logs provided.\n\nHowever, the fact that git.exe is creating these files might still be unusual. Normally, the package manager (npm, yarn) would handle the creation of node_modules files. If git is involved in creating them, maybe there's a misconfiguration or an attempt to use git in an unconventional way. But without more context, like other events or errors, it's hard to say.\n\nConsidering all this, the logs might be part of a normal operation, but the involvement of git.exe in creating node_modules files is somewhat unusual. However, since all the files are legitimate and part of a standard package, and there's no indication of malicious activity, it might not be interesting for investigation. But the classification depends on whether this is considered abnormal. If the system's normal operations include git creating these files, then it's not interesting. Otherwise, it might be a low-priority anomaly.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit low because without more context, it's hard to be certain.

So, there are multiple entries here, all related to file creation events triggered by git.exe. Each entry has a different file path under the node_modules\/semver directory. The files mentioned are typical for a package like semver, which is a version parser used in npm packages. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if these events are suspicious. Git.exe is a legitimate process, often used for version control. Creating files in node_modules is common during package installations or updates. The files listed, like parse-options.js, package.json, and various .js files in the ranges directory, are standard for a semver package. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any unusual activity. All the files are created by git.exe, which might be part of a normal clone or pull operation. But wait, git.exe usually doesn't create files in the node_modules directory. That's more typical of npm or yarn when installing dependencies. Maybe the user ran a git command that somehow triggered file creation in node_modules, which could be a red flag. \n\nAlternatively, if the user is working on a project that includes semver as a dependency, and they're using git to manage the repository, it's possible that these files are part of the project structure. However, the presence of multiple files being created in a directory structure that's usually managed by package managers might indicate that git is being used in an atypical way, perhaps due to a misconfiguration or a malicious attempt to inject files.\n\nBut considering the file names and paths, they seem legitimate. There's no indication of hidden files, unusual permissions, or other malicious activities. The confidence here is a bit tricky. On one hand, it's normal for package managers to create these files. On the other, git.exe creating them might be unexpected. However, without additional context like other suspicious events or known malicious activity, it's hard to say. \n\nGiven that all the files are part of a standard semver package and the process is git.exe, which could be part of a legitimate workflow (though not typical), I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence. However, if the system's normal operations don't involve git.exe creating files in node_modules, this could be a sign of something wrong.

However, node_modules usually contain third-party packages installed via npm or yarn. If these files are being created by git.exe, maybe the user is initializing a Git repository within the node_modules directory, which isn't common.\n\nWait, but why would someone do that? Maybe they're trying to track changes in the node_modules, which is generally not recommended because those directories are usually managed by package managers. Alternatively, this could be a sign of something malicious, like an attacker trying to inject files into the node_modules through Git. However, the presence of standard files like README.md, package.json, and LICENSE suggests that these are legitimate packages. \n\nBut then again, if these packages were cloned via Git instead of being installed via npm, it might be a deviation from normal behavior. However, without seeing any suspicious activity like unexpected network connections, unusual process behaviors, or modifications to critical system files, it's hard to label this as malicious. \n\nThe classification here depends on whether this is a normal operation or not. If the user is working on a project that involves Git and has these packages in the repository, then this is normal. But if the node_modules are supposed to be managed by npm and not Git, then this might be an issue.

But then again, maybe the user is just doing a normal git clone of a repository that includes these files. \n\nAnother angle: the path is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\. That looks like a student's project, possibly from a university course. The presence of node_modules suggests they're using npm packages. If the user is running git commands in that directory, maybe they're initializing a git repository or cloning one that includes these files. However, the fact that git is creating the files in node_modules might be unusual because normally, git would track files, but node_modules is usually ignored in .gitignore. \n\nWait, but if the user has a .gitignore that doesn't exclude node_modules, then git might be tracking them. However, that's not common practice. But in this case, the events are about files being created, not added to the repository. So perhaps the user is running a command that's generating these files, but that doesn't align with typical git operations.\n\nHmm. The key point here is that git.exe is the process creating these files. Normally, git doesn't create files in the node_modules directory unless it's part of a submodule or a specific operation. However, the number of files and their names suggest they are part of a library. If this is a legitimate project, then maybe the user is working with a submodule that's being initialized, but that would be a one-time event, not multiple files being created. \n\nAlternatively, if the user is running a command that's generating these files, but that's not typical for git. Another possibility is that the git process is being hijacked or there's a malicious script that's using git to write files. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nBut considering that all the files are part of a library (tcomb) and the process is git.exe, it's possible that this is a normal operation if the user is cloning a repository that includes these files. However, the fact that git is creating the files might be a red flag because normally, git would clone existing files, not create them in the node_modules directory. \n\nWait, node_modules is usually populated by npm, not git. So if git is creating these files, that's unusual. Maybe the user is using git to manage the node_modules, which is not standard. This could be a sign of something wrong. However, without more information, it's hard to be certain. \n\nBut given that the files are legitimate and part of a known library, and the process is git.exe, which is a legitimate tool, it might be a false positive. However, the action of creating files in node_modules via git is not typical, so this might be worth investigating further. \n\nIn conclusion, while the files themselves are legitimate, the process (git.exe) creating them in node_modules is unusual. This could be a sign of a legitimate action if the user is doing something non-standard, or it could be a sign of a potential security issue. However, without more context, it's hard to determine. But given that the files are part of a known library, it might be on the safer side to consider this as a normal operation, albeit unusual.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve **git.exe** creating multiple JavaScript\/TypeScript files (e.g., `Nil.js`, `Number.js`, `assert.js`, etc.) in the `node_modules\\tcomb\\lib` directory. Here's a structured analysis of the situation:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process Involved**:  \n   - **git.exe** is the process creating the files. This is unusual because **git** is typically used for version control (cloning repositories, committing changes, etc.), not for generating files in `node_modules`.\n\n2. **File Context**:  \n   - The files are part of the **tcomb** library, a popular type-checking utility for JavaScript. The file names (e.g., `Nil.js`, `Number.js`, `fail.js`) align with standard utility functions in such libraries.\n\n3. **Directory Location**:  \n   - The files are being created in `node_modules\\tcomb\\lib`, which is a typical location for compiled or source code in an npm package. However, **git** usually does not interact directly with `node_modules` (which is excluded by default in `.gitignore`).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Scenarios**\n1. **Legitimate Use Case**:\n   - **Submodule Initialization**: If `tcomb` is a Git submodule, cloning or initializing it might involve creating files in `node_modules`. However, this is **not standard practice**, as submodules are typically managed separately from `node_modules`.\n   - **Manual File Creation**: The user might be manually creating these files (e.g., during development or testing), though this would be rare given the number of files involved.\n\n2. **Unusual Behavior**:\n   - **Malicious Activity**: If **git.exe** is being hijacked or used as a vector to inject code into `node_modules`, this could indicate a **security risk**. However, the file names and structure do not immediately suggest malicious intent.\n   - **Misconfigured Tools**: A misconfigured build tool or script might be using **git** to write files to `node_modules`, which is non-standard and could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n3. **Typographical or Contextual Error**:\n   - The events might be a **false positive** due to a misinterpretation of logs or a tool incorrectly attributing file creation to **git.exe**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify the Source of the Files**:\n   - Check if the `tcomb` directory and its contents are part of a legitimate npm package installed via `npm install` or `yarn add`. If so, this might be a **misconfiguration** or a tooling issue.\n\n2. **Inspect Git Configuration**:\n   - Ensure that `node_modules` is excluded from version control (via `.gitignore`). If it is not, consider adding it to prevent unintended tracking of files.\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - If **git.exe** is creating files in `node_modules` repeatedly or unexpectedly, investigate further for potential **malware** or **script hijacking** (e.g., check for unauthorized changes to `git` or system files).\n\n4. **Contextual Context**:\n   - The presence of the directory `inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software` suggests this might be a **student project** or academic environment. If the user is working in a shared or restricted environment, ensure that all tools are authorized and up to date.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the files themselves appear legitimate (aligned with the **tcomb** library), the **git.exe** process creating them in `node_modules` is **unusual and non-standard**. This could indicate a **misconfiguration**, **tooling error**, or **potential security issue**, depending on the broader context. Further investigation into the user's workflow and system logs is recommended to rule out risks."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are related to files being created in the node_modules\\tcomb\\lib directory by git.exe. The user is probably working on a project that uses Node.js and has a package called tcomb, which is a library for type checking. The files being created are all JavaScript files, which seems normal for a Node module.\n\nBut wait, why are these files being created by git.exe? Typically, git.exe is used for version control, so maybe the user is cloning a repository or pulling changes. However, the files listed are part of the tcomb library, which is a dependency. If the user is installing dependencies via npm or yarn, those tools would usually handle the file creation, not git.exe directly. \n\nHmm, but maybe the user is using git to clone the repository, and the files are part of the project structure. However, the fact that multiple files are being created in the lib directory by git.exe might be unusual. Normally, git doesn't create files in the lib directory of a Node module; it's more about versioning the entire directory structure. \n\nAnother angle: Are these files part of a legitimate operation? The filenames like fromJSON.js, func.js, etc., look like standard library files. But if git.exe is creating them, it might indicate that the user is checking in these files, which could be part of a development workflow. However, if the user is not expecting these files to be created by git, it might be a sign of something malicious. \n\nWait, but the events are all FileCreate events. If the user is actively working on the project and using git to track changes, then these files being created by git could be part of the normal process. But I'm not sure. Another thought: Could this be a case where the git process is being used as a vector for malicious activity? For example, if an attacker is using git to inject malicious files. However, the files listed here are part of a legitimate library (tcomb), so that seems less likely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is running a script that uses git to generate these files, but that's not a common practice. The confidence here is a bit low because the events don't show any obvious malicious activity. The files are in a standard location for a Node module, and the process is git.exe, which is a legitimate tool. However, the fact that git is creating these files might be a red flag if it's not part of the normal workflow. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events seem to be part of a normal development process where git is being used to manage files in a project's node_modules directory. There's no indication of malicious behavior here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events show legitimate file creation by git.exe in a standard node_modules directory structure. The files are part of the 'tcomb' library, which is a known JavaScript type-checking library. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all from git.exe creating files in the node_modules directory under tcomb's lib folder. The files being created are things like isNumber.js, isObject.js, isString.js, etc. \n\nHmm, first thought: git.exe is typically part of Git for Windows, used for version control. When you clone a repository or pull changes, Git creates files as part of the normal process. So, if someone is using Git to manage a project, especially a Node.js project that uses tcomb (a library for type checking), these files might be part of the package's structure.\n\nBut wait, the classification here is about whether this is interesting or not. The key here is whether these file creations are normal or suspicious. Since all the files are in the node_modules directory, which is standard for npm packages, and the names of the files match typical JavaScript library files, this seems like normal activity. Git creating these files during a clone or pull would be expected.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any anomaly. For example, if these files were created by a different process, or if there were a large number of unexpected files. But in this case, the process is git.exe, which is legitimate, and the files are part of a known library. There's no indication of malicious activity here, like executable files being created or unusual paths. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes attackers might use Git to exfiltrate data or inject malicious code. But in this case, the files are standard library files. Unless there's a context missing, like other suspicious activities around the same time, these events alone don't indicate a threat.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these are likely normal Git operations during the installation or update of a Node.js package. Therefore, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no evidence of malicious behavior here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating standard JavaScript library files (e.g., isNumber.js, isObject.js) in a typical node_modules directory structure.
