{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user is asking whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first event: DiscordSetup.exe is being created, and the command line points to a download in the user's Downloads folder. That's a common place for legitimate installations, but sometimes malware is also downloaded there. Then, the ImageLoad event for DiscordSetup.exe shows the same path. That seems normal for a setup file.\n\nNext, there's a FileCreate event for Update.exe in the SquirrelTemp directory. Squirrel is a framework used by some applications for updates, so this might be part of a legitimate update process. But then, Update.exe is executed with the --install flag. That could be part of a legitimate installation, but I should check if there are any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the ImageLoad events for Update.exe, it's loading several .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard .NET components, so that's probably normal. However, the fact that Update.exe is loading multiple .NET assemblies might be part of a legitimate update process, but I should check for any anomalies.\n\nThen, there's a FileCreate event for Update.exe in the AppData\\Local\\Discord directory. That seems like a normal place for an application to store files. Also, another FileCreate event creates Discord.exe in the app-1.0.9190 directory. That looks like a typical installation structure for an application, possibly Discord itself.\n\nHowever, there are multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. ProcessAccess can indicate that another process is interacting with Update.exe. While this can be normal (like during installation), if there are too many of them, it might suggest something unusual. But in this case, the events don't show any malicious activity, just the process being accessed multiple times. \n\nI also notice that the user is running a legitimate application (Discord) and the logs include standard installation steps. The presence of SquirrelTemp and the Update.exe is common in applications that use Squirrel for updates. The .NET DLLs loaded are part of the .NET Framework, which is standard for many applications. \n\nHowever, the fact that the user is downloading an installer from the Downloads folder, which is a common vector for malware, might be a red flag. But the logs don't show any signs of malicious behavior such as network connections to suspicious IPs, unexpected file modifications, or unusual process behaviors. \n\nThe only thing that stands out is the high number of ProcessAccess events, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious. Since all the files are in expected locations and the processes are related to a legitimate application, this might just be a normal installation. \n\nBut I should also consider that if this is part of a larger set of events, maybe there are other indicators. However, based solely on the provided logs, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events align with a typical software installation process.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent a standard software installation process (Discord setup via Squirrel framework) with expected file operations and .NET component loading.

So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: \"Update.exe\" with a ProcessAccess event. Then there's a Discord.exe process created with a specific command line. The command line includes \"--squirrel-install 1.0.9190\". Wait, Squirrel is a framework used for installing and updating applications, right? So maybe this is part of a legitimate update process. But then there are multiple entries of ProcessAccess and ImageLoad events for Discord.exe and Update.exe.\n\nLooking at the ImageLoad events, they're loading ffmpeg.dll and other DLLs from the Discord app directory. That seems normal for an application. However, there's also an ImageLoad of mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET runtime. That's part of the Update.exe process. So Update.exe is using .NET, which might be normal if it's a legitimate update tool.\n\nBut wait, there are multiple instances of ProcessAccess and Pipe Created events for Discord.exe. The PipeEvent could be normal communication between processes, but if there are a lot of them, maybe that's suspicious. However, in this case, it's just several entries. Also, the same process is being accessed multiple times, but without any obvious malicious indicators like unexpected network activity or unusual file paths.\n\nThe command line for Update.exe includes --createShortcut, which is part of the Squirrel framework's installation process. That seems legitimate. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events for Discord.exe and its dependencies is typical for a running application. The fact that both Discord.exe and Update.exe are from the same directory (AppData\\Local\\Discord) suggests they might be part of the same application's update process.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any anomaly. For example, if the Update.exe was not supposed to be running, or if there were unexpected files loaded. But in the logs provided, all the files are from known locations, like the Discord app directory or standard Windows system directories for .NET components. There's no mention of network connections, registry changes, or other suspicious activities.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events seem to be part of a legitimate update process for Discord, using Squirrel and .NET. The repeated ProcessAccess and Pipe Created events are part of normal application behavior. There's no clear evidence of malicious activity here. Therefore, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING, as the events are consistent with normal application updates and operations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal application behavior, including legitimate Discord updates and .NET runtime operations. No malicious indicators (e.g., unexpected network activity, suspicious file paths, or anomalous process interactions) are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the JSON entries and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: Update.exe loaded clrjit.dll. That's a .NET DLL, and it's part of the Windows system. Maybe normal, but I should check if there's anything suspicious here. Then there are several Discord.exe processes. They're creating pipes, processes, and loading images like ffmpeg.dll. The command lines for Discord look legitimate, typical for a application starting up with various flags. \n\nWait, but there's also Update.exe creating files in the Start Menu Programs folder, like Discord.lnk. That's a shortcut. Now, why is Update.exe involved here? Usually, Update.exe might be part of an application's update mechanism. But creating a shortcut in the Start Menu could be normal, but maybe not if it's done by an unexpected process. However, the path seems to be under the user's AppData, which is common for applications. \n\nLooking at the events again, there are multiple ProcessAccess events for Discord.exe and Update.exe. But nothing that immediately stands out as malicious. The ImageLoad events for Discord.exe are loading its own executable and ffmpeg.dll, which is a common library used for multimedia tasks. \n\nHowever, the presence of Update.exe creating files and the multiple ProcessAccess events might be worth noting. But are they suspicious? If Update.exe is a legitimate updater, then it's normal. But if it's not, maybe. But the logs don't show any obvious signs of malware, like unexpected network connections, unusual file modifications, or access to sensitive areas. \n\nAnother point: the first event is Update.exe loading clrjit.dll. If that's a legitimate system file, then it's okay. But if it's being loaded from an unexpected location, that could be a red flag. However, the path given is C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\clrjit.dll, which is the standard location for that DLL. So that seems normal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, most of these events are related to normal application behavior—Discord starting up, creating processes, loading necessary DLLs, and Update.exe creating shortcuts. There's no clear evidence of malicious activity here. The events don't show any anomalies like unexpected file creation in sensitive directories, unusual network activity, or privilege escalation. Therefore, the batch might not be interesting for investigation. However, I should check if there's any hidden pattern. For example, is Update.exe being used in a way that's not typical? But the events only show it creating a shortcut and accessing processes, which could be part of a legitimate update process. \n\nSo, the classification is probably \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear malicious behavior detected in the logs provided. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6, because while there's no obvious threat, the presence of Update.exe doing file creation could be a minor point of interest, but without more context, it's not enough to flag as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event logs show activity related to **Discord.exe** and **Update.exe**, with no clear indicators of malicious behavior. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Legitimate Application Behavior**:\n   - **Discord.exe** processes are performing typical actions like creating pipes, loading DLLs (e.g., `ffmpeg.dll`), and accessing files. These activities align with normal application operation.\n   - Command-line arguments for Discord are standard for application startup.\n\n2. **Update.exe Activity**:\n   - **File creation** (e.g., `Discord.lnk` shortcut) in the Start Menu directory is consistent with legitimate software update\/installation processes.\n   - Multiple **ProcessAccess** events for `Update.exe` and `Discord.exe` are routine and not inherently suspicious.\n\n3. **No Red Flags**:\n   - No evidence of unexpected file modifications, network activity, or access to sensitive directories.\n   - Paths and DLLs referenced (e.g., `clrjit.dll` in the .NET Framework directory) are legitimate system components.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe events describe **normal application and update processes** without detectable malicious activity. While the presence of `Update.exe` creating shortcuts might warrant further context, the logs alone do not justify investigation for security threats.\n\n**Classification**: `NOT INTERESTING`  \n**Confidence**: 0.6 (moderate—no clear threats, but minor curiosity about `Update.exe` activity)."}

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nMost of the events are about \"Update.exe\" with ProcessAccess rules. That's a lot of repeated entries. But then there's a couple of FileCreate events where Update.exe created a Discord.lnk file on the desktop and another in the Start Menu. Also, there are ImageLoad events for Discord.exe loading various DLLs. \n\nNow, Discord.exe is a legitimate application, so loading its DLLs might be normal. However, the fact that Update.exe is creating shortcuts for Discord could be suspicious. Typically, legitimate updates wouldn't create desktop shortcuts unless it's part of an installation process. But the repetition of ProcessAccess events might indicate that Update.exe is running multiple times or being accessed frequently, which could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the classification should be based on the combination of all events. So, the key points here are: multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe, which could be normal if it's a legitimate update process. However, the creation of the Discord.lnk files by Update.exe might be unusual. Also, the ImageLoad events for Discord.exe are normal, but if Update.exe is creating shortcuts for a legitimate app, maybe that's part of a legitimate update. However, the fact that there are so many ProcessAccess events might indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated. \n\nAlternatively, if Update.exe is a legitimate updater, creating a shortcut is normal. However, if the Update.exe is not a trusted application, then this could be malicious. But the logs don't provide information about the source of Update.exe. \n\nHmm. The presence of both ProcessAccess and FileCreate events might indicate that the process is being used to create files, which could be benign or malicious. Since the classification is based on the entire batch, maybe the fact that there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. But without more context, like the reputation of Update.exe or any other indicators of compromise, it's hard to say. However, the repetition of ProcessAccess events and the creation of shortcuts could be a red flag. \n\nBut I need to be careful. Maybe the user is just installing Discord, and Update.exe is part of that installation. The ImageLoad events are normal for Discord. However, the multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe might be part of the installation process. \n\nAlternatively, if Update.exe is not a known legitimate process, then creating shortcuts and accessing processes could be malicious. But since the logs don't mention the source or any other malicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut the user's system might have a legitimate Update.exe, but the combination of creating shortcuts and multiple process accesses could be a sign of something. However, in the absence of other malicious indicators, it's not conclusive. \n\nSo, considering that, maybe the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities could be part of a legitimate process. However, the repeated ProcessAccess events might be a sign of something. But without more data, it's hard to be certain. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of FileCreate for Discord.lnk might be a red flag if it's not expected. But again, without more context, it's tricky. \n\nI think the justification would be that there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities, but not enough evidence to classify as interesting. So, the confidence might be around 0.5. But maybe the user considers multiple ProcessAccess events as suspicious. However, in some cases, that's normal. \n\nAlternatively, the fact that Update.exe is creating a shortcut in the Start Menu might be part of a legitimate installation, but the repetition of events might be overkill. \n\nIn conclusion, the batch might not be interesting enough to warrant an investigation unless there's more context.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of \"Update.exe\" triggering \"Process accessed\" events. That's a lot of the same process being accessed repeatedly. Then, there's one event where \"Update.exe\" creates a file called \"Discord.lnk\" on the desktop. That seems a bit odd. Normally, an update executable might not create a shortcut to another application unless it's part of a legitimate installation process. But creating a .lnk file could be a red flag, especially if it's pointing to something unexpected.\n\nNext, there's a \"Process terminated\" event for \"Update.exe\". That might be normal if the update process is finishing, but combined with the other events, it's something to note. Then, \"Discord.exe\" is involved in several \"Pipe Created\" events. Creating pipes can be normal for inter-process communication, but if it's happening repeatedly or in a suspicious context, it could indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a \"reg.exe\" process adding a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the value pointing to \"Update.exe\" and starting Discord.exe. That's a classic sign of persistence. Malware often adds itself to the registry run keys so it starts automatically when the user logs in. The command line here is setting up a registry entry that launches Discord.exe via Update.exe, which might be a way to ensure the malicious process starts every time.\n\nAnother registry event adds a URL protocol handler for \"Discord\" under HKCU\\Software\\Classes. This could be an attempt to associate the Discord protocol with the application, which might be legitimate, but combined with the other actions, it's suspicious. The fact that reg.exe is being used multiple times to modify the registry is concerning. Legitimate software might do this during installation, but the repetition and the specific commands here might indicate an attempt to modify system settings for persistence or to redirect traffic.\n\nAlso, the \"Discord.exe\" process is being accessed multiple times, and there are numerous pipe creation events. If Discord is a legitimate application, why are there so many pipe events? It's possible that the legitimate application is behaving normally, but the combination with the registry modifications and the shortcut creation makes me think there's something wrong here.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows a legitimate-looking process (Update.exe) creating a shortcut, modifying registry entries for persistence, and another process (Discord.exe) creating multiple pipes. The use of reg.exe to add run keys and URL protocols is a strong indicator of malicious activity, especially when combined with the repeated process accesses and the creation of the shortcut. Even though some of these events could be part of a legitimate installation, the combination and the volume of events suggest that this might be an attempt to install malware or a backdoor. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 'Update.exe' creates a Discord.lnk shortcut, 'reg.exe' modifies registry run keys and URL protocols for persistence, and 'Discord.exe' generates excessive pipe events.

So, first, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first event: Discord.exe creating a pipe. That's normal for communication, maybe between processes. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there's reg.exe adding a registry key for Discord's DefaultIcon. That seems legitimate, part of setting up the application's icon. But wait, the command line shows it's modifying the registry under HKCU. Maybe that's okay, but I should note it.\n\nNext, multiple entries of Discord.exe being accessed and creating pipes. Repeated pipe creation might be normal, but if it's excessive, could be a red flag. However, the logs don't indicate an unusual number here.\n\nThen, reg.exe again adding another registry key for the shell open command. This is part of setting up the application's context menu, which is normal during installation. But the command line here is setting the executable path with some parameters. That seems okay.\n\nThere's a registry value set event, which is part of the same setup. Still normal.\n\nThen, Discord.exe processes being terminated multiple times. Maybe part of normal operation, like updates or crashes. But multiple terminations could be a sign of something else.\n\nLooking further, there's an Update.exe process loading urlmon.dll from SysWOW64. That's a standard DLL, but sometimes attackers use legitimate DLLs for malicious purposes. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen, Discord.exe is started with a --squirrel-firstrun flag. Squirrel is a framework used for Windows application updates. So this might be part of an update process, which is normal.\n\nAnother ImageLoad event for ffmpeg.dll. That's a media library, commonly used by Discord. Seems legitimate.\n\nThen, Update.exe creating a shortcut in the Start Menu. That's typical during installation or updates. But if the shortcut is malicious, but the path points to the legitimate Discord.exe, so that's okay.\n\nThere are multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. Accessing processes is normal during updates, but too many might indicate something, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The majority of events are related to Discord's normal operations, setup, and updates. However, the presence of reg.exe modifying registry keys could be part of legitimate setup. But I should check if there's any unusual activity. The repeated pipe creations and process terminations might be normal for Discord, but it's worth noting. The use of Update.exe and the creation of shortcuts are part of standard update procedures.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. Since all these events are related to a legitimate application (Discord) during its normal operation, installation, and updates, there's no clear sign of malicious activity. Unless there's something I'm missing here. The events don't show any unauthorized access, unexpected network activity, or unusual file modifications. The registry changes are part of the application's setup. The only thing that might be a bit suspicious is the multiple ProcessAccess events, but that's common during updates.\n\nSo, I think this batch is not interesting for investigation.

There's also a \"Registry value set\" event related to Update.exe. Then, there are some entries for \"Discord.exe\" and \"DiscordSetup.exe\" with various tasks like DNS queries, process creation, image loading, and pipe creation. \n\nOne thing that stands out is the repeated access of \"Update.exe\". If a process is accessed multiple times, that might be normal if it's part of a legitimate update process. However, the presence of a file created at \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Desktop\\\\Discord.lnk\" could be suspicious. Shortcut files can sometimes be used in attacks to execute malicious code. \n\nLooking at the Discord-related events, there's a process creation with a long command line that includes some parameters. The command line has a URL pointing to \"f.a.k\/e\", which seems like a placeholder or fake URL. That's a red flag because legitimate software usually doesn't have such URLs in their command lines. Also, the image loading events for Discord.exe include a DLL from the Discord app directory, which might be normal, but the presence of \"ffmpeg.dll\" could be something to check if it's expected.\n\nAnother point is the registry value set by Update.exe. Changing registry values can be part of malicious activities, like persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. \n\nThe combination of multiple process accesses, a suspicious shortcut file, a potentially fake URL in the command line, and registry changes might indicate malicious activity.

The same process is being created multiple times with different parameters, but that's normal for a complex application with multiple components.

Then there are multiple Process accessed events all related to Discord.exe. That's a lot of ProcessAccess events. Normally, a legitimate application like Discord might have some process accesses, but so many in a row could be suspicious. Maybe something is trying to interact with the process repeatedly.\n\nThen there's another File created event for a Discord.lnk in the Start Menu Programs folder. That's a common place for shortcuts, so maybe that's normal. But combined with the previous one, maybe there's some duplication or something else going on.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but again, multiple instances might be a red flag. \n\nThen there's an event with reg.exe adding a registry entry under HKCU for Discord, setting the value to \"URL:Discord Protocol\". Registry modifications can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if it's creating a new protocol handler. That might be part of setting up a custom protocol, which could be used to launch the app via a URL, but if done by malware, it could be a way to persist or execute code.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple ProcessAccess events, file creations, and a registry change. The registry modification stands out as potentially malicious. However, Discord is a legitimate application, so maybe these are just normal operations. But the high number of ProcessAccess events and the registry change might indicate something more. \n\nBut wait, could this be part of a legitimate installation or update? Maybe the shortcut files are part of a user's setup. However, the combination of registry changes and repeated process accesses could be indicative of a malicious process trying to hook into Discord or modify its behavior. \n\nI should check if the registry entry is typical. Adding a protocol handler is common for apps that handle custom URLs, like \"discord:\/\/\". But the command line shows it's using reg.exe to add the entry, which is a standard tool. However, if this is done by a legitimate process, it's okay. But if the process is not expected to modify the registry, that's suspicious. \n\nSince the process is Discord.exe, which is known, maybe it's just updating its own registry entries.

But then I see a couple of reg.exe commands. \n\nWait, reg.exe is the Windows registry tool. The first reg.exe event adds a URL protocol entry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. That's unusual because creating a URL protocol association is typically done by applications to handle custom URLs, but it's not common for a regular application like Discord to do this without user interaction. Also, the second reg.exe command adds a default icon for the Discord entry. \n\nNow, the rest of the events are all related to Discord.exe, with multiple process accesses and pipe creations. However, the key point here is the use of reg.exe to modify the registry. Since the user is asking about potential malicious behavior, modifying the registry can be a red flag.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about reg.exe modifying the registry, specifically adding a value to the Discord shell command. That seems suspicious because modifying the registry to change how an application is launched could be part of a malicious activity, like changing the default behavior of Discord. But I need to check if this is part of normal operations or something else.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Discord.exe. The first one is a process access event, which is normal. But then there's a registry value set event, which might be related to the initial reg.exe change. Then there are several network connections detected. Discord is a legitimate application, so it's expected to have network activity, but the high number of connections might be a red flag. However, the number here is 10 entries, which could be normal for a running application.\n\nThere's also a DNS query event, which again is normal for any application that communicates over the internet. The image loaded events are also normal, as part of the application's execution. However, the file executable detected event points to a Widevine CDM DLL in the Temp folder. That's a bit odd because Widevine is a legitimate component for DRM, but the path is in the Temp directory, which might be a sign of something being unpacked or downloaded temporarily. \n\nWait, the command line for Discord.exe includes --type=utility and --utility-sub-type=unzip.mojom.Unzipper. That suggests that Discord is using an unzipper utility, which might be part of normal operations, like extracting files. But the presence of a DLL in the Temp folder being executed could be a concern. However, if it's part of the application's legitimate process, like updating or installing components, it might be okay.\n\nBut the initial registry modification by reg.exe is the most suspicious part. Changing the registry entry for Discord's shell command could be an attempt to hijack the application's execution path. For example, modifying the command to include additional parameters or pointing to a different executable. However, in the given event, the command line seems to be the legitimate path to Discord.exe with some parameters. So maybe that's just a normal configuration change. \n\nBut why would reg.exe be used here? Typically, reg.exe is a legitimate tool, but if it's being used by a malicious process to alter registry keys, that's a problem. However, the event doesn't show any other suspicious processes or anomalies. The rest of the events are about Discord.exe's normal operations. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. There's one potentially suspicious event (registry modification) but the rest are normal. However, the presence of the registry change combined with multiple network connections and the Temp file execution might indicate something more. But without more context, like other malicious activities or known bad indicators, it's hard to say. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user is just running Discord normally, and these events are part of its regular operations. For example, updating itself, using network connections, and unpacking components. The registry change could be part of a legitimate update process. \n\nSo the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events, while a bit unusual, don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The registry change is legitimate if done by the user or as part of the application's setup. The network connections and Temp file are part of normal operations. However, the confidence isn't 100% because the registry modification could be a red flag. But since there's no other evidence of malicious intent, it's safer to say not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events in this log appear to be **legitimate** and related to **normal operations** of the Discord application, with no clear evidence of malicious activity. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Registry Modification (reg.exe)**:  \n   - The modification of the Discord shell command in the registry is **expected** for applications that integrate with the operating system (e.g., adding a protocol handler or custom context menu). The command line points to the legitimate `Discord.exe` path, which does not indicate tampering.\n\n2. **Discord.exe Activity**:  \n   - **Network Connections**: Multiple `NetworkConnect` events are **normal** for Discord, as it communicates over the internet for messaging, voice, and data synchronization.  \n   - **DNS Queries**: Routine for any application with internet connectivity.  \n   - **Image Loads**: Loading `ffmpeg.dll` and `Google.Widevine.CDM.dll` is **legitimate** for media playback and DRM (Widevine is a standard DRM component).  \n   - **Temp File Execution**: The `FileExecutableDetected` event for `Google.Widevine.CDM.dll` in the Temp directory is **expected** during unpacking or temporary use of components.\n\n3. **No Malicious Indicators**:  \n   - No anomalies such as unexpected processes, suspicious file paths, or unusual command-line arguments (e.g., `powershell`, `cmd`, or obfuscated strings).  \n   - The `--utility-sub-type=unzip.mojom.Unzipper` flag in the command line is part of Discord’s legitimate unpacking process for updates or plugins.\n\n### Conclusion:  \n**NOT INTERESTING** for investigation. The events align with **normal Discord behavior**, including registry configuration, network communication, and temporary file usage. No red flags are present.  \n\n**Confidence Level**: High (90%) – The activity is consistent with legitimate software operations."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, all related to Discord.exe. Each entry has a winlog task, mostly \"Network connection detected (rule: NetworkConnect)\", but there's also a \"Process terminated\" and a \"Registry value set\" event.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is suspicious. Discord is a legitimate application, so normal network activity might be expected. However, the repetition of NetworkConnect events could indicate something. But wait, how many times is it happening? There are 8 NetworkConnect events, one ProcessTerminate, and one RegistryEvent. \n\nBut is that abnormal? Well, Discord does connect to the internet for its services, so multiple network connections might be normal. However, if there's a sudden spike in such events, that could be a red flag. But the user hasn't provided timestamps, so I can't tell if they're all in a short period or spread out.\n\nThe other events: ProcessTerminate and RegistryEvent. The ProcessTerminate might be normal if the application is closing properly. The RegistryEvent could be part of Discord's own operations, like updating settings. But if these events are from unexpected sources or involve sensitive registry keys, that might be suspicious. However, the logs don't specify the registry key or the action details.\n\nSince all the events are from Discord.exe and the tasks are related to its normal operations (networking, terminating, registry changes), there's no clear indication of malicious activity here. Unless there's something else, but based on the given data, these seem like legitimate events. \n\nSo, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING because the events are consistent with normal Discord behavior. The confidence is medium because while the repetition might be notable, without more context (like timestamps, destination IPs, or unusual registry keys), it's hard to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events are related to legitimate Discord.exe operations (network connections, process termination, registry changes), which align with normal application behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
