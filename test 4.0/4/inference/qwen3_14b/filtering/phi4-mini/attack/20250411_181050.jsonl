{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's whoami.exe, which is a normal command to get user info. Then powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's probably legitimate. But then I see some certutil.exe commands. Certutil is usually used for certificate utilities, but sometimes it's abused for encoding\/decoding files, which can be part of malware activities.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the certutil entries: it's encoding calc.exe into a temporary file. Wait, calc.exe is a normal Windows calculator, but if someone is using certutil to encode and decode files, that might be a red flag. Especially if they're writing to temporary directories, which is common in malicious activities to avoid leaving traces.\n\nAnother entry has certutil decoding a file from the temp directory into another executable. That decoded file might be malware. Also, there are multiple registry events and process accesses, which could indicate someone trying to modify system settings or inject code. The use of rundll32.exe with PcaSvc.dll might be legitimate, but sometimes that's used in exploits.\n\nThen there's SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Those are standard DLLs, but if they're being loaded by an unexpected process, that could be a sign of something bad. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious payloads here.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are about network connections, which is normal, but if there's a lot of unexpected connections, that could be a problem. However, in this batch, it's just two network connects, so maybe not enough to flag.\n\nPutting it all together: the certutil commands encoding and decoding files, along with the creation of temporary executables, are suspicious. Those actions are often seen in malware campaigns where they encode malicious payloads to avoid detection. The combination of these events, even if some are normal, might indicate an attempt to execute malicious code. So, this batch seems interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files (common in malware), creation of temporary executable files in AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp, and frequent process access\/registry modifications. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with network connections. That's common, maybe normal browsing. But then there's a powershell.exe creating a file called componente_auxiliar.txt in the Downloads folder. That's a bit suspicious because PowerShell is often used for scripting, and creating a file in Downloads might be benign, but combined with other activities?\n\nThen there are several registry value set events from chrome.exe. Changing registry values could be part of malware behavior, but Chrome might do that for updates or settings. However, multiple registry changes might indicate something more. \n\nAnother entry is winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal during setup. But maybe the path is unusual? The version number 8.15.1 seems specific, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen, PowerShell again with registry value set and process accessed events. Process access could be a red flag if it's accessing other processes without permission. But without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry changes by Chrome and PowerShell, a file created by PowerShell. However, none of the events show clear signs of malicious activity like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or known malicious files. The file created is in the Downloads folder, which is common. The winlogbeat activity seems legitimate. The confidence is moderate, but not high enough to classify as interesting. Maybe the justification is that there's no clear malicious activity detected.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"No clear malicious activity detected. Chrome.exe network connections and registry changes are common for legitimate operations. PowerShell file creation in Downloads directory is benign. Winlogbeat file creation is related to log shipping tool configuration. No suspicious process access or exfiltration patterns observed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
