The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are multiple instances of ProcessAccess, ProcessCreate, RegistryEvent, ImageLoad, FileCreate, and FileDeleteDetected. The command line for one of the PowerShell processes is creating a new PSDrive pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$, which might be a remote share. That seems suspicious because accessing a remote drive could be part of data exfiltration or lateral movement.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate event where a temporary script file is created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. The file is named something like __PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1. After that, the same file is deleted. That's odd because creating and then immediately deleting a file might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. The presence of the script file, even if it's deleted, could indicate malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for system DLLs like mscoreei.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpClient.dll. While loading system DLLs isn't necessarily bad, the repetition and combination with other events might be part of a larger attack. The use of PowerShell for creating drives, registry changes, and file operations could be part of a script-based attack.\n\nThe repeated use of whoami.exe might be benign, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it could be part of reconnaissance. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious intent here. The key points are the creation and deletion of the temporary script, the remote drive mapping, and the multiple PowerShell operations. These could be signs of an attacker trying to execute commands remotely or manipulate the system.\n\nBut I should check if there's any other suspicious activity. There's also a PipeEvent, which might be used for inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The confidence here is moderate because while some activities are suspicious, they could also be part of normal operations or testing. However, the combination of events does raise flags that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit suspicious behavior, including creating a remote drive mapping (\\\\Target\\\\C$), creating and immediately deleting a temporary script file in the AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp directory, and loading potentially malicious DLLs.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe processes. That's common, but sometimes malicious activity uses PowerShell. Let me check the command lines. The first entry has a command line of \"powershell.exe & {}\", which seems odd. Usually, PowerShell scripts have more commands. Maybe that's a placeholder or a mistake, but it's worth noting.\n\nThen there are several Image Load events. The files loaded include mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. Those are legitimate system files, so that's normal. However, there's a file named System.Management.Automation.ni.dll, which is part of PowerShell, so that's expected too.\n\nThere's a File Created event for a temporary script file, __PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That could be part of a normal process, like testing script policies, but sometimes attackers create and delete files quickly to avoid detection. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother File Created event is for a StartupProfileData file. That might be related to PowerShell profiles, which are normal. But if there's unexpected activity here, it could be suspicious.\n\nThere are also Registry value set events, which could indicate changes to system settings. However, without knowing what specific registry keys were modified, it's hard to assess.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe is normal; it's a legitimate tool that displays user information. The command line here is straightforward.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple PowerShell processes, loading legitimate DLLs, creating and deleting temporary files, and registry changes. While some of these could be part of normal operations, the combination might be suspicious. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading payloads, connecting to external IPs, or unusual command-line arguments beyond the initial \"powershell.exe & {}\".\n\nThe confidence here is moderate. It's not definitively malicious, but the pattern warrants further investigation. So I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.65.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious command-line patterns, temporary file creation\/deletion, and .NET-related DLLs loaded, which may indicate script-based attacks or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, almost all of them are related to powershell.exe. That's a common tool, but it's also often used in malicious activities. There are several Image loaded events pointing to system files like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others from the .NET framework. These are legitimate files, but loading them might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there's a File created event for a temporary PowerShell script, and then immediately a File Delete event. That could be part of normal operations, like testing scripts or cleaning up. But the fact that it's created and deleted so quickly might be worth noting. Also, there's a Pipe Created event, which could be used for inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad but might be part of something more.\n\nThere are multiple Process accessed events, which could indicate that PowerShell is interacting with other processes. The whoami.exe executions are normal, just checking the user. But the PowerShell command line that checks for procdump.exe in a specific path might be interesting. Procdump is a legitimate tool, but if it's being checked for existence, maybe there's an attempt to use it for dumping processes, which could be malicious.\n\nThe Registry value set event might indicate changes to the registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The repeated Process accessed events might suggest that PowerShell is being used to access other processes, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting it all together: most events are normal system activities, but the combination of PowerShell's actions, the temporary script creation and deletion, the check for procdump.exe, and the registry changes might indicate something suspicious. However, since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like unauthorized access or data exfiltration, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there are enough anomalies to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events include loading legitimate system DLLs (e.g., clr.dll, mscoreei.dll) and temporary script creation\/deletion, which could indicate benign operations.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' loading images. The first one is loading clr.dll, which is part of the .NET Framework. That's normal, but then there's a System.Management.Automation.ni.dll from the Windows Defender directory. Wait, that's interesting because System.Management.Automation is related to PowerShell, but the path is in the ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender folder. Maybe that's a legitimate file, but I should check if it's expected there. Also, the third entry is loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's Platform. MpOAV is part of Microsoft Defender's real-time protection, so that's probably legitimate. But maybe the fact that PowerShell is loading these DLLs is normal, or could be part of a malicious activity?\n\nThen there's a File Delete event where a temporary script file is deleted. The path is in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is common for temporary files. However, the fact that PowerShell is deleting it might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with other events?\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event with no file. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but again, not inherently malicious. Then a File Created event in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That's part of PowerShell's startup profiles, so maybe that's normal. But if it's being created in a non-interactive context, maybe that's unusual?\n\nThen there are Process Access events for PowerShell. Those might indicate that another process is accessing PowerShell, which could be normal or part of a compromise. However, the justification for being interesting might be the combination of events.\n\nLooking at the 'whoami.exe' processes. That's a standard command to get user information, so that's normal. The 'cmd.exe' running 'netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off' is a red flag. Disabling the firewall is a clear indicator of malicious activity. The command is turning off the firewall, which would leave the system vulnerable. That's a strong sign of an attack. Then 'netsh.exe' is called with the same command, which is also suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry events from 'svchost.exe' modifying registry keys. svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's making multiple changes to the registry, especially if those changes are related to disabling firewall or other security features, that's concerning. However, in this case, the events just mention registry object added or deleted, but without specific details on what's being changed, it's a bit hard to tell. But combined with the firewall disable command, that might indicate that the attacker is modifying the registry to persist or disable security features.\n\nPutting it all together: the key events are the 'netsh' command disabling the firewall and the multiple registry changes. Even though some PowerShell activities are normal, the combination with disabling the firewall is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The deletion of a temporary script file might be part of cleaning up after an attack. The presence of multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe could be related to the attack's persistence or configuration changes. Therefore, this batch is interesting because it includes actions that disable security features, which is a clear sign of an attack in progress.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes disabling Windows firewall via 'netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off' and multiple suspicious registry modifications by svchost.exe, which are strong indicators of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. All the events are from svchost.exe, which is a common Windows process that hosts various system services. The winlog task is \"Registry object added or deleted (rule: RegistryEvent)\" each time. Now, svchost.exe is legitimate, but it's also a common vector for malware because it can host multiple services.\n\nHowever, in this case, all the events are the same: svchost.exe triggering registry changes. Since there's no variation in the processes or additional context like different registry keys being modified, file paths, user accounts, or other processes involved, it's hard to tell if this is malicious. The repetition of the same event might be normal system behavior, especially if a service is starting up and modifying the registry. But without more information, like if there are other suspicious processes or if this is happening in a short time frame, it's not enough to flag as interesting. The lack of other indicators makes it less likely to be a security threat. So, the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events are identical svchost.exe registry operations with no additional context or anomalies detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by looking at the patterns here.\n\nFirst, there are a lot of entries with \"svchost.exe\" and the winlog task being \"Registry object added or deleted (rule: RegistryEvent)\". That's a lot of registry changes. Normally, svchost.exe is a legitimate process that hosts various system services, but if there are numerous registry modifications, that could be a red flag. However, I should check if there's any suspicious activity beyond that.\n\nThen, there's one entry where the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and another with \"Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)\". The pipe creation might be normal, but combined with registry changes, it's something to note. But the main thing here is the PowerShell commands. \n\nLooking at the command_line for some processes: \"powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\". Wait, the parameter \"-unidade_auxiliar\" seems off. That's not a standard PowerShell parameter. The correct parameter for the UNC path is \"-root\" or \"-location\". Using \"-unidade_auxiliar\" might be a typo or a sign of a malicious script trying to map a network drive. Also, the UNC path \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\" suggests accessing a remote machine's C$ administrative share, which is typically used for remote administration. If this is done without proper authorization, it could be part of an attack.\n\nNow, considering the frequency. There are multiple instances of the same PowerShell command being executed. That repetition might indicate an automated process or a script that's trying to establish persistent access. Also, the fact that it's using svchost.exe, which is a common host for services, could mean that the malicious activity is being masked under a legitimate process.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these events might be false positives. For example, legitimate software might modify the registry, and PowerShell is a common tool for administrators. But the combination of multiple registry changes, the suspicious PowerShell command with a typo in the parameter, and the attempt to map a network drive all together raises suspicion. \n\nThe confidence here would be high because the combination of these events points towards potential malicious activity. The use of a non-standard parameter in PowerShell and the network drive mapping are strong indicators. Even though svchost.exe is legitimate, the context here suggests it's being used for something unusual. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a high confidence level. The justification is the suspicious PowerShell commands and the multiple registry events that could indicate unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple svchost.exe processes triggering registry events combined with PowerShell commands attempting to map a remote network drive (\\\\Target\\\\C$) using a suspicious parameter (-unidade_auxiliar), which is not a standard PowerShell parameter.

The first one is \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\". Hmm, creating a new PSDrive with a network path, maybe accessing a remote machine's C$ share. That's a common technique in attacks to map network drives. But I need to check if that's suspicious here.\n\nThen there are a bunch of empty commands like \"powershell.exe & {}\", which might be placeholders or tests. Not sure yet. But the later entries have a more specific command: checking if \"procdump.exe\" exists in a certain path. Procdump is a legitimate tool, but it's also used in malware for dumping processes. The path mentioned is \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\". The use of \"..\" in the path could be a red flag, indicating possible directory traversal or trying to access files outside the intended directory. \n\nAlso, the fact that the same command is repeated multiple times might indicate that the attacker is checking for the presence of procdump.exe repeatedly, perhaps as part of a larger attack chain. The combination of creating a PSDrive to a remote share and checking for specific tools like procdump could be part of an attack where the attacker is setting up access and checking for tools to use later.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these might be benign. For example, if the system is using PowerShell for legitimate administrative tasks, but the repetition and the specific paths might still be suspicious. The presence of both \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks in winlog could be part of normal operations, but the PowerShell commands themselves are what's drawing attention.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating a network drive, repeated checks for a specific executable, and the use of potentially malicious tools like procdump might indicate an ongoing investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because some parts could be normal, but the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands mapping network drives (e.g., \\\\Target\\\\C$) and repeatedly checking for 'procdump.exe' in suspicious paths (with '..' directory traversal) suggest potential reconnaissance or preparation for lateral movement\/exploitation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
