{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user is asking me to analyze these logs and determine if they're relevant for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are multiple entries with processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, sc.exe, and others. The winlog tasks include things like Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, and Image loaded. \n\nI notice that there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes creating a service with a binPath pointing to a script that doesn't exist: \"c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Also, another sc.exe entry has a similar path: \"c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1\". These non-existing scripts might be a red flag because attackers often try to execute non-existent files to avoid detection, or maybe they're part of a larger attack plan.\n\nThen there's an event where calc.exe (calculator) has an image loaded from urlmon.dll. While urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows component, loading it into a process like calculator might be unusual. But wait, there's another entry for Calculator.exe (note the capitalization) also loading urlmon.dll. This could be a typo or a different process, but it's worth noting.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a lot of registry value set events, which might be normal, but combined with the suspicious service creation and the non-existent scripts, it could indicate someone trying to modify the system. Also, the use of sc.exe to create a service with a command that starts a PowerShell script might be part of an attempt to persist or execute malicious code.\n\nHowever, there's also a winlogbeat.exe event creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, so this might be a normal activity. But if that's part of the user's environment, it's not suspicious. However, if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious points are the attempts to create services pointing to non-existent PowerShell scripts and the unusual image loading in calculator processes. These could be indicators of malicious activity, like trying to execute scripts or modify system configurations. However, without more context, it's a bit tricky. The presence of multiple registry events might be normal, but combined with the other factors, it's leaning towards being interesting. \n\nI think the confidence is around 0.75 because there are some clear suspicious activities, but some parts might be benign. The justification would be the creation of services with non-existent scripts and unusual image loading, which are potential signs of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Creation of services with non-existent scripts (e.g., 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1'), 2) Frequent registry modifications by legitimate processes (cmd.exe, services.exe), 3) Unusual image loading in calculator processes (urlmon.dll). These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior such as service persistence attempts or code execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a list of JSON objects, each representing a system event.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe. Some of these are common, like Calculator and Chrome, but others like ApplicationFrameHost might be part of normal operations. However, PowerShell is often used in malicious activities, so that's a red flag.\n\nNext, the winlog tasks. There are Registry value set events, Process accessed, and Pipe Created. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're frequent or from unexpected processes, that's suspicious. The ProcessAccess event for PowerShell might indicate someone trying to access or manipulate the process. The PipeCreated event could be related to inter-process communication, which isn't always bad, but combined with other events might be concerning.\n\nLooking at the file paths. Most entries have \"file\": \"None\", but there are two ImageLoad events for chrome.exe. The first one is amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. That's legitimate. The second is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's Platform. Also legitimate. However, if these were loaded from unexpected locations, that could be a problem. But in this case, the paths seem correct.\n\nNow, considering the combination. There are multiple Registry value set events for chrome.exe. While Chrome might modify its own registry settings, a high number of such events could indicate tampering. The presence of PowerShell with ProcessAccess might suggest someone is trying to interact with the process, possibly for malicious purposes. However, without more context like unusual command-line arguments or unexpected network activity, it's hard to be certain.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned analyzing the entire batch. The majority of events are from Chrome and PowerShell. The registry changes and process access might be part of normal operations, especially if Chrome is updating its settings. However, the fact that PowerShell is involved in ProcessAccess could be a sign of something more. But since there's no clear indication of malicious activity like unexpected file paths, failed attempts, or known malicious hashes, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nConfidence here is a bit low. The events don't clearly point to a security incident, but there are enough suspicious elements (PowerShell access, multiple registry changes) that warrant further investigation. So, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events involving chrome.exe and powershell.exe, along with process access attempts, suggest potential system manipulation or lateral movement. While some activity (e.g., legitimate DLL loading) appears normal, the combination of events warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
