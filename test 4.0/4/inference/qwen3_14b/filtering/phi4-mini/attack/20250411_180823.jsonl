{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that's okay. Notepad modifying the registry might be odd, but maybe it's part of normal user activity.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe and svchost.exe with registry changes. PowerShell is common for administrative tasks, but if it's doing unexpected things, that could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nNow, looking at the cmd.exe entries. One of them has a command line that creates scheduled tasks with schtasks. The command line includes creating tasks that run calc.exe on logon and startup. Creating scheduled tasks with cmd.exe might be suspicious, especially if it's done by a user or process that shouldn't be doing that. Also, the tasks are set to run as system, which could be a sign of privilege escalation.\n\nAnother entry is schtasks.exe creating a task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same calc.exe command. This seems like a pattern of creating multiple scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe. While calc.exe is a harmless utility, the fact that multiple tasks are being created with similar names and using schtasks might indicate an attempt to persist on the system. \n\nThe file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup is a scheduled task file. This path is typical for legitimate tasks, but the name seems arbitrary and possibly generated by an attacker. The presence of multiple such tasks with different names could be an indicator of malicious activity, especially if they're being created by a non-system process.\n\nAlso, the command lines use schtasks with \/create and specify \/ru system, which means the task runs as the system account. This might be legitimate in some scenarios, but if it's done without proper authorization, it's a concern. The use of cmd.exe to run calc.exe is a bit odd since calc.exe is a simple calculator, but maybe it's a test or a placeholder for a more malicious payload.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple scheduled tasks being created with schtasks, some running as system, and the use of cmd.exe to execute calc.exe. While individual components aren't obviously malicious, the combination of creating multiple tasks with arbitrary names and using system-level privileges could indicate an attempt to establish persistence. The presence of these tasks might be a sign of a broader attack, such as an exploit that's trying to maintain access to the system. \n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malware or data exfiltration here. The events are all related to process creation and registry changes, which are common in both legitimate and malicious activities. So, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" because the pattern of creating multiple scheduled tasks with specific names and using elevated privileges is suspicious and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious scheduled task creations via schtasks.exe with arbitrary names (e.g., 'modulo_principal_005_OnStartup') and execution of calc.exe through cmd.exe, indicating potential persistence mechanism attempts. The use of system account privileges and repetitive task creation patterns raises concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to analyze these log entries and determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking through each event.\n\nFirst, there's ApplicationFrameHost.exe and chrome.exe doing registry value sets. That's common for normal operations, maybe part of their regular functioning. Then there's powershell.exe involved in registry changes and process access. Hmm, PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities. \n\nWait, there's an entry where chrome.exe loaded amsi.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender's anti-malware scanning. If chrome is loading that, maybe it's part of a security check. But I'm not sure if that's normal. Also, there's a file created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder called unidade_ativo.txt. That could be benign, like a user saving a file, but sometimes attackers use similar names for malicious files. \n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard tool for checking user context, so that's probably normal. However, if it's being run in a suspicious context, maybe. But on its own, it's not necessarily bad.\n\nLooking at the frequency: chrome.exe has a lot of registry value set events. That might be normal for Chrome, but if there's a sudden spike, it could be something. However, the logs here don't show a time frame, so I can't tell if it's a sudden change. \n\nThe presence of PowerShell doing file creation and process access could be a red flag. But without more context, like command-line arguments or unusual paths, it's hard to say. The file created is in the Downloads folder, which is common for users. \n\nThe justification needs to be concise. Maybe the combination of multiple registry changes by chrome and powershell, along with file creation, is enough to warrant further investigation. However, since there's no clear malicious activity like unexpected network connections or unauthorized access, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say around 0.6. There are some suspicious elements, but nothing definitive. The classification would be INTERESTING because there are multiple events that could indicate potential issues, even if they're not confirmed yet.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and powershell.exe, combined with file creation in user Downloads directory, suggest potential for malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
