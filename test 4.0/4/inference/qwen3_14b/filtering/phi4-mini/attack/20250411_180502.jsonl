{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe with network connections detected. That's common, maybe normal browsing, but not necessarily suspicious on its own. However, the repetition might be a sign of something, but I need to check other events.\n\nThen, looking at the powershell.exe events. There's a lot of activity here. The first thing I notice is the registry value being set multiple times. That could be part of normal operations, but combined with other events, it might indicate something else. \n\nNext, there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell. The files loaded are .dlls from Microsoft.NET and Windows Defender. That seems legitimate, but maybe the context is important. However, there's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a red flag because creating and deleting a temporary file could be part of an attack, like executing a script and then cleaning up traces. \n\nThen, looking at the command_line entries for PowerShell. Each one starts a process with a batch file path. The paths have some suspicious patterns, like using \"..\\\" to navigate directories. This might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual path or to access files in parent directories, which can be a tactic used by malware to avoid detection. \n\nAlso, the filenames of the batch files are all named similarly, with \"script.bat\" and random strings. This might be part of a script that's being executed multiple times, possibly for malicious purposes. The fact that they're all in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory is another point of concern, as that's a common place for temporary files that could be exploited.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell processes executing these scripts, combined with registry changes and file operations, could indicate an attempt to modify system settings or execute malicious code. The fact that some of the loaded DLLs are from Windows Defender might be a way to bypass security software, but I need to check if that's a known tactic.\n\nAlso, there are events from ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe with registry changes. That might be part of normal operations, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it could be a sign of a broader attack. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated PowerShell activity, the creation and deletion of temporary files, the use of obfuscated paths, and the loading of various DLLs could be indicative of a malicious process. Even though some components are legitimate, the combination of these events raises suspicion. The confidence level is high enough to warrant further investigation, so the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing obfuscated batch scripts from temporary directories, combined with registry modifications and suspicious file operations (create\/delete), indicate potential malicious activity. The repetitive pattern of command-line arguments with '..\\\\' path traversal and temporary file usage raises suspicion of evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple events related to chrome.exe with tasks like \"Pipe Created\" and \"Registry value set\". Chrome doing registry modifications might not be normal, but maybe it's part of its usual operations. However, seeing so many registry events from chrome could be a red flag. But I need to check other entries too.\n\nThen there's an event with powershell.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate DLL, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell to load malicious DLLs. However, the path here is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is a standard location. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a cmd.exe process created with a command line that runs a batch file from \"C:\\entrada_ativo\\estrutura_principal\\entrada_geral_script.bat\". The path here is a bit unusual. \"entrada_ativo\" might be a typo or a non-standard directory. This could be a sign of something malicious, especially if the script is doing unexpected things.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creates a file in the user's AppData directory. That's common for legitimate software, but sometimes malware also uses AppData. However, the file name here is \"StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\", which might be related to PowerShell profiles. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder: \"componente_principal.txt\". Creating a text file isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it might be something. But again, not conclusive.\n\nLooking at the chrome.exe events again, there's loading of amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate DLLs related to Windows Defender. So that's normal. But maybe the fact that chrome is loading them is unusual. Wait, no, maybe that's part of the browser's interaction with the system. Not sure.\n\nThere's also a svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization folder. That's part of Windows' delivery optimization feature, which is legitimate. So that's probably okay.\n\nNow, considering all these events. The main suspicious points are the multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and the cmd.exe running a script from a non-standard path. However, the other events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The PowerShell events are common, and the file creations are in typical locations. But the combination of multiple registry changes and the batch file execution might indicate something. However, without more context, like the content of the batch file or other anomalies, it's hard to be certain. \n\nWait, the classification needs to be based on the entire batch. The presence of the cmd.exe running a script from an unusual path, along with multiple registry changes, might be worth investigating. But is that enough? Maybe not definitive, but enough to flag as interesting. The confidence would be around 0.6, as there are some suspicious elements but not enough to be certain. So the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a justification that includes the unusual batch file execution and multiple registry events.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and a suspicious cmd.exe process executing a script from a non-standard path (C:\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\...). These activities could indicate potential malicious behavior or system tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. The first four entries are all about chrome.exe performing a registry value set task. That's a common activity for browsers, maybe updating settings or extensions. But repeating the same task multiple times might be a red flag. However, I need to check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nThen there's an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file like .winlogbeat.yml.new makes sense during setup or updates. That seems normal.\n\nAnother event is powershell.exe creating a file named elemento_base.txt. PowerShell is often used for scripting, and creating a text file isn't inherently malicious. But I should check if the path or other details are suspicious. The path is in the Downloads folder, which is common for user-generated files. However, if there were other malicious activities linked to this file, it could be a concern.\n\nNow, looking for patterns. The first four events are all chrome.exe modifying the registry. If this were part of a legitimate process, like a browser update, it's normal. But if it's part of a persistence mechanism or modifying critical registry keys, it could be malicious. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being modified. Without more details, it's hard to tell, but repeated registry changes by the same process might warrant further investigation.\n\nThe other two events involve file creation by legitimate processes. Winlogbeat and PowerShell are both common tools. Unless there's an unusual path or the files have suspicious content, these might be normal activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch has some repetitive registry modifications by chrome.exe, but no clear signs of malicious activity in the other events. However, the repetition might indicate something worth looking into. The justification would be that multiple registry changes by chrome.exe could be benign, but they might also be part of a larger attack. Since there's no other suspicious activity, the confidence is moderate. Maybe around 0.6. The classification would be INTERESTING because there's a potential anomaly that needs further examination.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing repeated registry modifications (Registry value set) could indicate legitimate browser activity or potential persistence mechanisms. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file and powershell.exe creating a text file in the Downloads directory is generally benign but warrants contextual analysis.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
