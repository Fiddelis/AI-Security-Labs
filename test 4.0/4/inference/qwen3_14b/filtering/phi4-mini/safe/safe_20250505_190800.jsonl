The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: mmc.exe with a registry value set. That's a normal process, part of the Microsoft Management Console. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there are several entries about powershell.exe. The first one is a process creation, which is common. But then there are image loaded events. The files loaded include mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are all .NET framework components. Loading them is normal when PowerShell is running scripts that use .NET, so maybe not a problem yet.\n\nBut wait, there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1, and then it's deleted. That's a temporary script file, which could be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use temp files to execute malicious scripts. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother file created is teste.ps1 in the Downloads folder. Then there's a process creation with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\teste.ps1. Bypassing execution policy is a red flag because it allows scripts to run without being restricted. This could indicate that someone is trying to run a script that would normally be blocked by the execution policy.\n\nAlso, there are multiple image loads of .NET DLLs, which might be normal, but combined with the bypassed execution policy and the creation of a script file, it might be part of a malicious activity. The fact that the script is in the Downloads folder and executed with Bypass could be a sign of a user trying to run an untrusted script.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Provider Lifecycle events for PowerShell. These might be related to the script execution, but again, without knowing the exact actions, it's hard to say. The deletion of the temp file after creation could be an attempt to clean up evidence.\n\nPutting this all together: the key suspicious points are the use of -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, which is often used in attacks to run scripts that would otherwise be blocked, and the creation and execution of a script file. These events, when combined, suggest that there might be an attempt to execute a script in a way that bypasses normal security measures. However, it's possible that this is a legitimate action if the user is running a trusted script. But given the presence of these indicators, it's worth investigating further to confirm whether the script is malicious or not.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious activity: execution policy bypass, temporary script file creation\/deletion, and loading of .NET framework components which may indicate script-based attacks or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided three log entries. Let me go through each one.\n\nFirst event: PowerShell created a file in the Temp directory with a name that looks like a script. The path is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1. The task is File created under FileCreate rule. That might be normal, but sometimes temp files can be used for malicious purposes.\n\nSecond event: The same PowerShell process deleted that same file. Task is FileDeleteDetected. Deleting a file right after creating it could be suspicious. Maybe they're trying to hide evidence? Or perhaps it's part of a legitimate process, like testing a script and cleaning up.\n\nThird event: PowerShell created another file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. The path is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Startup profiles are used for PowerShell configurations. Creating a file here might be normal, but if it's not expected, it could be an indicator of compromise.\n\nPutting it all together: The first two events involve creating and deleting a script file in the Temp directory. That could be part of a malicious activity, like executing a script and then deleting it to avoid detection. The third event is creating a file in the Startup directory, which might be an attempt to persist access. However, without more context, like the content of the files or other related events, it's hard to be certain. But the combination of creating and deleting a script file followed by creating a startup file raises some flags. It's not definitive, but it's enough to warrant further investigation. So the classification is INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show PowerShell creating and immediately deleting a temporary script file, followed by creating a file in the PowerShell Startup directory. This pattern may indicate script execution attempts and potential persistence mechanisms, warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
