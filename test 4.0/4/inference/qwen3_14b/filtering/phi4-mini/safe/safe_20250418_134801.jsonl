The first one is about Microsoft Edge's setup.exe being created in the Program Files directory. That seems normal, but maybe the file creation time change is a red flag. Then there's CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll, which is a legitimate Windows file, so probably not an issue.\n\nNext, setup.exe creating a pipe. Pipes are common for inter-process communication, so that's probably normal. Services.exe logging on and user account management events are standard system activities. The PowerShell command is checking for defaultinstall sections in INF files. That might be part of a legitimate system check, but the command line is a bit complex. \n\nThen there's a file created by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper.

However, the repeated events of MpCmdRun.exe from Windows Defender could be normal, but I should check for any suspicious behavior. \n\nThe deletion of a temporary Microsoft Edge file is typical during installation.

The PowerShell script is scanning INF files, which could be related to driver installation or system updates. The user account management events are normal. \n\nI don't see any clear signs of malware here. The events seem to be part of system updates, installations, and normal Windows processes. The confidence is medium because while some events are common, the combination might be part of a legitimate activity. However, without more context, it's hard to say.

So, there are multiple entries here, each indicating that 'git.exe' created various files in the 'semver' directory under node_modules. The files include things like inc.js, lte.js, major.js, etc. Hmm, first thought: git is a version control tool, and normally it's used for cloning repositories, committing changes, etc. But creating files in node_modules... that's a bit unusual.\n\nWait, node_modules is where npm packages are installed. So, if someone is using git to create files in node_modules, that might not be standard behavior. Typically, git would be used to manage the source code in the project directory, not the node_modules folder. Unless the user is trying to version control the node_modules, which is not common practice. But even then, why would git be creating those files?\n\nAnother angle: the files being created are part of the 'semver' package. Semver is a library for handling semantic versioning. If these files are being created by git, maybe there's an issue with the git operation, like a checkout or a clone that's somehow generating these files. But that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, could this be a malicious activity? Like, an attacker using git to inject files into the node_modules directory. However, the process is git.exe, which is a legitimate process. But if someone is using git in an unusual way, maybe that's a red flag.\n\nWait, but looking at the paths, all the files are in the same directory structure: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\semver\\... So, maybe the user is working on a project that uses the semver package, and they're running git commands that are creating these files. For example, if they did a 'git checkout' in a directory that has node_modules, but that's not typical. However, if the user is cloning a repository that includes node_modules, but that's also not standard. Normally, node_modules are excluded from version control via .gitignore.\n\nSo, maybe the presence of these files being created by git is a sign that the user is not following best practices, but it's not necessarily malicious. However, the fact that git is creating these files might be unusual. But I need to check if this is a known behavior. For example, if the user is using git to manage a package that's in node_modules, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe the user is using a git hook or a script that's generating these files. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother point: the classification is based on whether the batch is relevant for investigation. If these events are normal, then it's not interesting. But if they are abnormal, then it's interesting. Since git is a legitimate process, but creating files in node_modules is not typical, this might be worth investigating. However, it's possible that the user is doing something non-standard, but not malicious. The confidence here is a bit low because without more context, it's hard to tell. But the fact that multiple files are being created in a structured way by git might indicate something unusual. Maybe the user is trying to inject code or there's a misconfiguration. However, I can't be certain.

Git.exe is a legitimate process used for version control. When you clone a repository or run 'git init', it's normal for git to create files and directories, especially in node_modules if the project has dependencies. The paths here are all standard for a Node.js project, with packages like semver, serialize-javascript, set-blocking, and set-function-length.

There's no mention of other processes or unexpected file types. The confidence here is low because the activity aligns with normal git operations.
