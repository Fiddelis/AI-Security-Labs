{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the entries here are about files being created, specifically by a process called SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files (with .js extensions) located in the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles directory under a Microsoft Office SolutionPackages folder. The filenames have a pattern with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash. That seems a bit odd. Why so many files? And why are they all being created by SDXHelper?\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is not a standard Windows process. I should check if that's a legitimate process. Maybe it's part of some software, but the name doesn't ring a bell. Typically, processes like this could be related to software installation or updates. However, the fact that so many files are being created in a specific directory might indicate some kind of deployment or possibly malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the filenames again, \"officeaicopilot\" makes me think of Microsoft Office, but \"aicopilot\" isn't a known Microsoft product. Maybe a typo or a misnamed file. Also, the \"min\" in the filename suggests minified JavaScript, which is common for web apps but not typically for desktop applications. That's a bit suspicious.\n\nAnother entry has a task \"Security Group Management\" but no process or file info. That might be a red herring or part of another event. However, the majority of the logs are about file creations by SDXHelper. \n\nI should consider if this is part of a legitimate software update. For example, when Office updates, it might download and install files. But the repetition of the same filenames being created multiple times (like several entries for the same hash) might indicate that the process is being repeated unnecessarily, which could be a sign of something wrong.\n\nAlso, the directory path is under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. If SDXHelper is a legitimate part of Office, then maybe this is normal. But I'm not sure. Maybe the user should check if SDXHelper is a known process. If it's not, that's a warning sign.\n\nAnother angle: the number of files. Creating over 20 files in that directory might be excessive. Legitimate updates usually don't create so many files. Also, the fact that the process is creating these files without user interaction could be concerning.\n\nI should also check if any of these files are known malware. But without the actual files, that's hard. However, the pattern of activity is suspicious enough. The combination of an unknown process, multiple file creations in a non-standard location, and the use of minified JS files could point towards malicious activity, like a dropper or part of a larger attack.\n\nIn conclusion, the logs show a high number of file creations by an unknown process in a specific directory, which is not typical for normal operations. This is likely worth investigating further to ensure there's no malware involved.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a potentially suspicious pattern of activity that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Over **20+ entries** show `SDXHelper.exe` creating JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`.\n   - The filenames follow a pattern of `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`, with repeated entries for the same hash (e.g., `min_1444839d33dbd032e97e946723d18d56.js` appears twice).\n\n2. **Unusual Process and File Behavior:**\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is not a standard Windows process. Its presence and behavior (massively creating minified `.js` files in a non-standard directory) are atypical for legitimate software.\n   - The files are **minified JavaScript**, which is common in web applications but unusual for local desktop software, especially in the context of Microsoft Office directories.\n\n3. **Directory Context:**\n   - The files are created in a directory associated with **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages**, which could indicate an attempt to mimic or exploit Office-related processes.\n\n4. **Security Event:**\n   - One entry logs a **\"Security Group Management\"** task with no process or file context, which may be unrelated but adds to the overall anomaly.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- **Malicious Activity:** The repetitive creation of files by an unknown process in a sensitive directory (linked to Microsoft Office) could indicate a **malware dropper**, **data exfiltration**, or **tampering** with Office-related processes.\n- **Lack of Legitimacy:** `SDXHelper.exe` is not a recognized Microsoft process. Its behavior (mass file creation in a non-standard location) does not align with typical software deployment or update patterns.\n- **Minified Files:** The use of minified `.js` files in a local system directory is highly unusual and may suggest **obfuscated malicious code**.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Verify `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Check the **file signature** and **digital certificate** of `SDXHelper.exe` (if it exists on the system).\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **Malwarebytes** to scan for malware.\n\n2. **Investigate the Files:**\n   - Analyze the contents of the created `.js` files to check for malicious code (e.g., obfuscation, network requests, or payloads).\n\n3. **Monitor System Behavior:**\n   - Use **process monitoring tools** (e.g., **Process Monitor**, **ProcDump**) to track `SDXHelper.exe`'s activity in real time.\n\n4. **Check for Unauthorized Software:**\n   - Ensure no unauthorized software is installed that could be responsible for this behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs strongly suggest **suspicious activity** that could indicate **malware** or **unauthorized software deployment**. Immediate investigation is recommended to confirm legitimacy and mitigate potential risks. If `SDXHelper.exe` is not a trusted process, it should be removed, and the system should be scanned for infections."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a list of log entries, and I need to determine if they indicate any suspicious activity. The task is to check if these logs are normal or if there's something unusual going on.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each log entry. The majority of them are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" with the task \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" and the file paths all seem to be JavaScript files under a specific directory: \"C:\\Users\\fidelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js\". The filenames have a pattern with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a hash-like string and \".js\".\n\nThen there's one entry from \"chrome.exe\" with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and \"file\": null. That might be normal, but I need to check if that's part of regular Chrome operations or something else.\n\nNow, considering the \"SDXHelper.exe\" entries. SDXHelper is a known component related to Microsoft Office, particularly with the Office Deployment Tool or Click-to-Run. It's responsible for installing or updating Office components. The creation of multiple JavaScript files in the specified path might be part of a legitimate Office update or installation process. However, the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times could be a red flag. Are these files being created multiple times by the same process? If so, that might indicate an issue, like a loop or excessive file creation.\n\nAnother thing to note is the directory structure. The path includes \"SolutionPackages\" and \"OfflineFiles\", which sounds like it's related to offline installation or caching of Office packages. The filenames being minified JavaScript files (\"min_\") could be part of some scripts used during installation or configuration.\n\nHowever, the presence of a registry event from Chrome might be unrelated, but I should check if that's a normal operation. Chrome setting a registry value could be part of its normal operation, like storing preferences or settings. But without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nNow, looking for anomalies. The same file being created multiple times by SDXHelper could be a sign of a problem. For example, if the same file is being written repeatedly, maybe due to a bug in the installation process or a malicious attempt to overwrite or inject code. But I need to verify if this is typical behavior for SDXHelper.\n\nAlso, checking the hash-like strings in the filenames. They might be unique identifiers for each version or package. If they're all different, that's normal. But if they're the same, that might be a problem. However, looking at the provided entries, each filename has a different hash string, so that's probably normal.\n\nAnother angle: the number of entries. There are about 20 entries, most from SDXHelper. If this is part of a normal installation, that's expected. But if this is happening frequently or in a short time frame, it might be concerning. However, without knowing the time context, it's hard to assess.\n\nPotential malicious activity: If SDXHelper is being used to create files that are not part of a legitimate Office installation, that could be a problem. However, the filenames and directory structure align with what I've seen in Office installations. The fact that the files are JavaScript might be part of some configuration or script execution during setup.\n\nBut wait, JavaScript files in an Office installation? That seems unusual. Office typically uses binaries, but maybe these are part of some web-based components or scripts used during the installation process, especially if it's related to Click-to-Run or online deployment.\n\nAlso, the presence of the registry event from Chrome might be a red herring unless there's something else in the logs that connects it. But since it's the only Chrome entry, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn conclusion, while the majority of the logs appear to be from a legitimate process (SDXHelper creating files as part of an Office installation), the repetition of the same file creation multiple times might warrant further investigation. However, without more context or additional logs, it's difficult to determine if this is truly malicious or just a quirk in the installation process.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries provided appear to be from a legitimate process related to **Microsoft Office installation or updates**, but there are **potential red flags** that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Overview of Log Entries**\n- **Most entries** are from **`SDXHelper.exe`**, a known component of **Microsoft Office Click-to-Run** (used for deploying Office installations).\n- **File creation events** point to JavaScript files (`*.min.js`) in a directory structure typical of Office updates:\n  ```\n  C:\\Users\\fidelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...\n  ```\n- **One entry** from **`chrome.exe`** involves a **registry value change**, which is normal for Chrome but unrelated to the Office logs.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Legitimate Activity**\n- **SDXHelper.exe** is a **legitimate process** responsible for installing\/updating Office components. The creation of JavaScript files in the specified path could be part of:\n  - **Offline installation caching** (e.g., `OfflineFiles` directory).\n  - **Script execution** during setup (e.g., configuration or dependency resolution).\n- **Filename patterns** (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) suggest unique identifiers for specific packages or versions, which is common in software deployments.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Potential Red Flags**\n- **Repetition of the same file creation**: \n  - If the **same file** (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) is being created **multiple times** by `SDXHelper.exe`, this could indicate:\n    - **A loop or error** in the installation\/update process.\n    - **Malicious activity** (e.g., overwriting files, injecting code).\n  - However, in the provided logs, **filenames appear unique**, which is normal for different packages or versions.\n- **JavaScript files in Office directories**:\n  - Unusual, as Office typically uses binaries (e.g., `.dll`, `.exe`). However, JavaScript files might be used in **web-based components** (e.g., Office 365 add-ins) or **scripting during deployment**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Chrome Registry Event**\n- The **`chrome.exe`** entry involves a **registry value change**, which is **normal for Chrome** (e.g., storing user preferences, extensions, or settings). \n- **No immediate concern** unless correlated with other suspicious activity (e.g., unexpected behavior from Chrome).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Recommendations**\n- **Monitor for repeated file creation** by `SDXHelper.exe` with the **same filename** or unusual patterns (e.g., excessive file count).\n- **Check for unauthorized modifications** to the `Office\\SolutionPackages` directory (e.g., unexpected files, malware signatures).\n- **Verify the legitimacy of the installation\/update**:\n  - Ensure it's part of an **official Microsoft Office deployment**.\n  - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Microsoft's Office Deployment Tool logs** to trace `SDXHelper.exe` activity.\n- **Scan for malware**:\n  - Run a full system scan using updated antivirus software.\n  - Check for **unusual network activity** from `SDXHelper.exe` or Chrome.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Conclusion**\n- **Likely legitimate** if the logs are from a **planned Office installation\/update**.\n- **Further investigation** is needed if:\n  - The **same file is created repeatedly**.\n  - **Unusual network traffic** or system behavior is observed.\n  - **Malware signatures** are detected in the files.\n\nIf this is part of an **unexpected or uninitiated process**, it could indicate a **compromise** or **malicious activity**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a list of file creation events, all from the same process, SDXHelper.exe, in the same directory under Microsoft Office. The files all have names that start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a hash-like string and \".js\". \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what these files are. The name \"officeaicopilot-strings.min.js\" suggests they might be JavaScript files related to a feature called \"AICOPILOT\" in Microsoft Office. The \"min\" part indicates they are minified, which is common for production code to reduce file size.\n\nNow, looking at the pattern of the filenames. Each has a unique hash, which might be a version or build identifier. Since there are multiple files with the same hash, like \"min_9a8575295259d8d88fee11e5538812be.js\" appearing twice, that could mean there were duplicate creations, maybe from different processes or updates.\n\nBut why are there so many of them? If this is part of a normal operation, maybe during an update or when the application is initializing, it might generate these files. However, the sheer number of files (over 20) seems high. Typically, applications don't create that many files in a short period unless there's an issue.\n\nI should consider possible causes. One possibility is that SDXHelper.exe is part of a malicious payload, generating these files as part of its activity. However, SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, specifically for handling add-ins or other components. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother angle: the files are all JavaScript. If they're part of a legitimate update or feature, they might be part of a dynamic loading mechanism. However, the hash-based naming is more common in web development for caching purposes, which is a bit different from desktop applications.\n\nAlso, checking for duplicates. Some hashes are repeated, which might indicate that the process is trying to create the same file multiple times, which could be a sign of a problem, like a race condition or a loop in the code.\n\nBut I need to be careful. If this is from a user's system, maybe they're experiencing an issue with Office, and these files are part of that. However, the user hasn't mentioned any errors or symptoms, so this is speculative.\n\nAnother thought: the \"AICOPILOT\" might be a feature or a product name. Maybe it's a new feature in Office that's being rolled out, and these files are part of that feature's localization or resource files. The \"strings\" part might indicate localization strings, which are often minified and hashed for efficiency.\n\nBut again, the number of files is concerning. Legitimate software usually doesn't generate that many files in a single directory unless it's a temporary cache or something similar. However, the fact that they're all in the same directory under Office's installation might be normal for certain operations.\n\nI should also consider that the user might be seeing these files due to a specific action they took, like installing an update or running a particular Office application. Without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn summary, while the files could be legitimate, especially if related to a new Office feature, the high number and the hash-based naming might warrant further investigation. The user should check if there are any Office updates or issues reported, or run a virus scan to rule out malware, even though SDXHelper.exe is legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\nThe files you've listed appear to be **JavaScript files** generated by the **SDXHelper.exe** process, which is associated with **Microsoft Office** (specifically, it's used for handling add-ins or other components). Here's a breakdown of the key observations and potential implications:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **File Naming Pattern**:\n   - All files are named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`, where `<hash>` is a unique alphanumeric string.\n   - The \"min\" suffix indicates **minified JavaScript** (common in production code for optimization).\n   - The hash in the filename likely represents a **version or build identifier**.\n\n2. **Repetition of Files**:\n   - Some hashes (e.g., `9a8575295259d8d88fee11e5538812be`, `a97a3b3b45b83dda327cdb2b00b9f984`) appear **twice**, suggesting **duplicate creation** of the same file. This could indicate:\n     - A **redundant process** (e.g., multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe running).\n     - A **loop or error** in the code generating these files.\n\n3. **Location**:\n   - The files are stored in a directory under **Microsoft Office** (likely part of an add-in, feature, or localization resource).\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Explanations**\n1. **Legitimate Office Feature**:\n   - The files might be part of a **new Microsoft Office feature** (e.g., \"AICOPILOT\" could be a product or feature name).\n   - The \"strings\" in the filename may refer to **localization strings** or **resource files** used for dynamic content loading.\n\n2. **Update or Initialization**:\n   - The high number of files could be related to an **Office update** or **initialization process**, where temporary or cached files are created.\n\n3. **Malicious Activity (Unlikely but Possible)**:\n   - While **SDXHelper.exe** is a known legitimate process, **malware** could potentially hijack it to generate suspicious files.\n   - However, this is **less likely** unless there are other signs of compromise (e.g., unexpected network activity, system slowdowns).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Check for Office Updates**:\n   - Ensure your Microsoft Office installation is up to date. Sometimes, new features or updates generate temporary files.\n\n2. **Verify SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Confirm that **SDXHelper.exe** is legitimate by checking its **file path** (should be in the Microsoft Office installation directory, e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\v16.0\\`).\n\n3. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan using your **antivirus software** to rule out malware.\n\n4. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - If the files are created frequently or consume excessive disk space, investigate further (e.g., check for unauthorized processes or updates).\n\n5. **Contact Microsoft Support**:\n   - If the files are part of an unexpected Office feature or behavior, reach out to **Microsoft Support** for clarification.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe files are **likely legitimate**, especially if they are part of a new Office feature or update. However, the **repetition of files** and **high volume** warrant further investigation to ensure no malicious activity is occurring. If you're experiencing performance issues or unexpected behavior, consider the steps above."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing some system activity. The main thing here is to figure out if there's anything suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created, specifically JavaScript files in a directory under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The process responsible for most of these is SDXHelper.exe. Now, SDXHelper is part of Microsoft's Click-to-Run deployment, which is used for installing Office. So normally, this process might be creating files as part of updates or installations. However, the sheer number of files being created here is quite high. There are over 20 entries, many of them with similar names but different hashes or timestamps. That's a lot for a normal update.\n\nThen there's one event where Chrome is setting a registry value. That might be normal user activity, but combined with the other events, it's worth noting. However, the main concern is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper. If this were a legitimate update, you'd expect fewer files or maybe a different pattern. Also, looking at the file paths, they're all in the same directory, which might be a sign of a malicious process trying to drop a lot of files quickly, which is a common tactic for malware.\n\nAnother thing to check is if there are any duplicates. Wait, looking at the entries, there's a line that mentions the same file path twice: \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_e8258ccc81800836b588886c13cb1182.js\" appears twice. That's unusual. Duplicate file creations could indicate an error in the process or maybe an attempt to overwrite or replace files, which might be part of a malicious payload.\n\nAlso, the filenames have a pattern that looks like they could be obfuscated or generated dynamically. The \"min_\" prefix suggests minified JavaScript, which is common in legitimate web applications but could also be used by malware to hide code. However, the presence of \"officeaicopilot\" in the filename makes me think it's related to Office, but maybe it's a spoofed name.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that SDXHelper is being exploited. If the process is compromised, it could be used to write malicious files. The fact that so many files are being created in a short period might be a sign of that. Additionally, the registry event from Chrome might be unrelated, but it's a red flag if there's other suspicious activity.\n\nAnother angle is to check for any known malicious activity associated with SDXHelper. However, I don't recall any specific malware using SDXHelper as a vector. But that doesn't rule it out. The key here is the volume and the repetition of the file creation events. Legitimate processes usually don't generate that many files in such a short time, especially with the same naming pattern.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple file creations by SDXHelper, a high number of files, possible duplicates, and the filenames' structure. These factors combined make me think this could be a security incident. The user should investigate further by checking the integrity of the files, looking for any unexpected processes, and reviewing system logs for other anomalies.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate a high volume of file creation events by the **SDXHelper.exe** process, which is associated with Microsoft Office Click-to-Run deployment. While some file creation is expected during legitimate Office updates, the **pattern and volume** of these events raise concerns. Here's a breakdown of the key observations and potential risks:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Findings**\n1. **Massive File Creation by SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Over **20+ JavaScript files** (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_*.js`) are created in the same directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\{User}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\{UUID}\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`.\n   - This is **unusual** for a legitimate update process, which typically involves fewer files or different file types (e.g., executables, DLLs).\n\n2. **Duplicate File Entries**:\n   - The file `officeaicopilot-strings.min_e8258ccc81800836b588886c13cb1182.js` is listed **twice**, suggesting potential **duplicate writes** or errors in the process.\n\n3. **Suspicious Filename Structure**:\n   - The filenames include `min_` (common in minified JavaScript) and obfuscated hashes (e.g., `e8258ccc81800836b588886c13cb1182`), which may indicate **malicious payloads** disguised as legitimate Office-related files.\n\n4. **Registry Event from Chrome**:\n   - A single event shows **Chrome setting a registry value**. While this could be benign, it is **incongruous** with the rest of the activity and may warrant further investigation.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks**\n- **Malware Activity**: The **abnormal volume of files** and **obfuscated naming** could indicate a **malicious process** exploiting SDXHelper.exe to **drop payloads** (e.g., phishing scripts, backdoors).\n- **Compromised Process**: SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but if **compromised**, it could be used to **execute malicious code** or **persist on the system**.\n- **Data Exfiltration**: JavaScript files in the `OfflineFiles` directory might be used to **exfiltrate data** or **interact with external servers**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify File Integrity**:\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **Malwarebytes** to scan the files for malware.\n   - Check file hashes against **Microsoft's official repositories** to confirm legitimacy.\n\n2. **Investigate SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Use **Process Monitor** or **ProcDump** to analyze SDXHelper.exe's behavior.\n   - Check for **unexpected network activity** or **registry changes**.\n\n3. **Review System Logs**:\n   - Look for **other suspicious events** (e.g., unauthorized access, unexpected service startups).\n   - Correlate with **Windows Event Logs** (e.g., Security logs for failed logins, Process Creation events).\n\n4. **Isolate and Contain**:\n   - If malware is confirmed, **isolate the affected system** and **remove the malicious files**.\n\n5. **Update and Patch**:\n   - Ensure **Office and Windows are up to date** to mitigate known vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some file creation by SDXHelper.exe is normal, the **scale and pattern of activity** here suggest a **potential security incident**. Immediate investigation is recommended to rule out malware or process compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's chrome.exe and SDXHelper.exe. Chrome is a common browser, so some of its activities might be normal, like loading DLLs. But I notice that chrome.exe is loading urlmon.dll from System32, which is a legitimate file. However, there are multiple entries of chrome.exe creating files in the Downloads folder, specifically a file named \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\" and its Zone.Identifier streams. Zone.Identifier is usually created when a file is downloaded from the internet, so that's normal. But the repeated creation of the same file and its streams might be a red flag if it's happening excessively or in an unusual context.\n\nThen there's SDXHelper.exe, which is creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames are officeaicopilot-strings.min with various hashes. Office AICopilot might be related to Microsoft Office add-ins or copilot features, but the fact that SDXHelper is creating so many JS files in that location could be suspicious. SDXHelper isn't a standard Microsoft process; I'm not sure what it does. Maybe it's part of some software, but creating multiple files in Office's directories might be an indicator of something malicious, like a dropper or a tool that's embedding malicious scripts.\n\nAlso, there are several registry value set events by chrome.exe. Changing registry values can be part of legitimate operations, but if done in a way that's unusual or in specific keys, it could be malicious. However, without more context on which keys are being modified, it's hard to say. But combined with the file creation activities, it might be worth looking into.\n\nAnother point is the repetition of events. The same file creation by SDXHelper.exe happens multiple times with different hashes. That could be normal if it's part of an update or package installation, but it's also a tactic used by malware to spread or persist. The fact that these files are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory under SolutionPackages might be part of an Office add-in, but again, without knowing the expected behavior of SDXHelper, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe Zone.Identifier streams are usually created by Windows when a file is downloaded, to mark it as coming from the internet. The fact that chrome.exe is creating these streams for the Excel file is normal. However, the multiple entries might indicate that the file is being downloaded multiple times, which could be due to a user action, but could also be a sign of automated downloads or something else.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of SDXHelper.exe creating numerous JS files in Office directories and chrome.exe's activities might be worth investigating. While some activities are normal, the repetition and the locations of the files could indicate potential malicious activity. The presence of multiple files with similar names but different hashes might be a sign of a larger payload being distributed. However, without more context or known bad indicators, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the information, it's on the edge of suspicious, so marking it as interesting for further analysis makes sense.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n1. **Chrome Browser Operations**:\n   - **`urlmon.dll` loading**: Normal for Chrome to load system DLLs like `urlmon.dll` (part of Windows' URL moniker system).\n   - **Zone.Identifier Streams**: Common when files are downloaded from the internet, indicating the file was marked as \"downloaded\" by Windows.\n\n2. **Office Add-In Context**:\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** creating JavaScript files in `Office\\OfflineFiles` may align with legitimate Office add-in or co-pilot-related operations, though this requires validation against known good behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Potentially Suspicious Activity**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`**:\n   - **Multiple JS Files with Unique Hashes**: The creation of numerous JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_*.js`) with distinct hashes in the Office directory raises concerns. While this could be part of a legitimate update or package, the volume and repetition are unusual and may indicate:\n     - **Malware Persistence**: Embedding malicious scripts in trusted directories.\n     - **Dropper Behavior**: Generating payloads or configuration files for further exploitation.\n\n2. **Chrome's Registry Modifications**:\n   - **Frequent `Registry value set` Events**: While registry changes are common, the lack of context (e.g., specific keys modified) makes this ambiguous. However, combined with other activities, it could suggest attempts to modify system behavior.\n\n3. **Repeated File Operations**:\n   - **Multiple Creation of `Cronograma.xlsx` and Zone.Identifier Streams**: While downloading files is normal, the repeated creation of the same file and its streams could hint at:\n     - **Automated Downloading**: Possibly triggered by malicious scripts or persistence mechanisms.\n     - **File Tampering**: Overwriting or modifying files in a way that evades detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n- **Unusual Process Behavior**: `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Microsoft process. Its role and legitimacy require validation.\n- **Directory Anomalies**: Writing to `Office\\OfflineFiles` (typically for trusted add-ins) with non-standard files may indicate misuse of trusted paths.\n- **Lack of Context**: No clear correlation between Chrome and `SDXHelper.exe` activities, which could suggest unrelated or coordinated malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation**\nThis batch is **interesting for investigation** due to:\n- **Unusual file creation patterns** by `SDXHelper.exe`.\n- **Potential misuse of trusted directories** (Office OfflineFiles).\n- **Lack of clear benign context** for the observed behavior.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Validate the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., digital signatures, process tree, network activity).\n- Analyze the contents of the generated JavaScript files for malicious payloads.\n- Correlate registry changes with other system logs to identify potential modifications to critical settings.\n\nWhile not definitively malicious, the combination of anomalies warrants deeper analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. There are several events related to file creation and image loading. The processes involved include SDXHelper.exe, EXCEL.EXE, svchost.exe, and HxTsr.exe. \n\nLooking at the file paths, most of the created files are in standard locations like AppData, System32, or ProgramData. For example, SDXHelper.exe is creating JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That seems a bit odd because Office typically doesn't generate JS files in those folders. Also, there are multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe creating files with different language-specific UI strings, which might be part of a malicious payload or just normal operations? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's EXCEL.EXE loading several DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. These are legitimate system DLLs, so that's normal. But the fact that Excel is loading so many of them might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nWait, there's also a file stream created in a Temp directory with a .xlsx file. That could be normal, but the name is 1680A406.xlsx. Not sure if that's relevant.\n\nNow, the user mentioned \"malicious behavior.\" The key here is to find anomalies. The SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files in the Office SolutionPackages seems a bit off. Also, the presence of HxTsr.exe modifying the registry. HxTsr.exe is a known process related to hardware monitoring, but if it's modifying registry values, that could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother point is that SDXHelper.exe is creating files with names like \"af-za-ui-strings-json\" and others with different language codes. That seems like it's generating localization files, which might be part of a legitimate application, but in the context of Office, maybe not. However, the path includes \"OfflineFiles,\" which might be part of a package installation.\n\nI should check if there's any unusual combination of events. The main suspicious points are the multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in non-standard locations and the registry modifications by HxTsr.exe. However, without more evidence like unexpected network activity or process injections, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. \n\nConsidering all that, the batch might not be highly suspicious. The events could be part of normal Office operations or software updates. However, the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in the Office directory might warrant further investigation. I'll lean towards it being interesting but not definitively malicious without more context.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **moderate indicators of potential interest** but does not definitively point to malicious behavior. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation Activity:**\n   - Multiple entries show **SDXHelper.exe** creating files in the `Office\\SolutionPackages\\OfflineFiles` directory, with filenames like `am-et-ui-strings-json_...js` and `ar-sa-ui-strings-json_...js`. These files appear to be language-specific localization resources.\n   - **Context:** While unusual, such files could be part of legitimate Office package installations or updates, especially if tied to language packs or add-ins. However, the repetitive nature of the file creation (multiple language-specific files) raises a **low-level flag** for further scrutiny.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **HxTsr.exe** and **svchost.exe** are observed modifying registry values. \n   - **HxTsr.exe** is a known legitimate process (related to hardware monitoring tools like HWMonitor), but **registry modifications** by this process could indicate tampering or configuration changes. This warrants investigation into the specific registry keys altered.\n\n3. **Excel.EXE DLL Loading:**\n   - **EXCEL.EXE** loads standard system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `amsi.dll`, `urlmon.dll`). These are expected for normal operations (e.g., COM object handling, network requests). No immediate red flags here.\n\n4. **File Stream Creation:**\n   - A temporary `.xlsx` file (`1680A406.xlsx`) is created in a user-specific `Temp` directory. This could be part of normal Excel operations (e.g., temporary file generation during document processing). No suspicious behavior detected here.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity:** **Low to Moderate**  \n  The most suspicious element is the **repetitive file creation by SDXHelper.exe** in non-standard paths, which could indicate **unauthorized packaging or tampering**. However, this could also be part of a legitimate Office update or localization process.\n- **Registry modifications** by HxTsr.exe and svchost.exe are **not inherently malicious** but should be investigated to confirm their legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- **Investigate the SDXHelper.exe activity** further by:\n  - Checking if the files created are part of a known Office package or update.\n  - Monitoring for additional anomalous behavior (e.g., network connections, process injections).\n- **Audit registry changes** made by HxTsr.exe and svchost.exe to ensure they align with expected configurations.\n- Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user activity) for context.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe batch is **not definitively malicious**, but the **unusual file creation patterns** and **registry modifications** merit **further investigation** to rule out potential threats. No immediate action is required, but monitoring and deeper analysis are advised. \n\n**Final Verdict:** **Interesting (Moderate Risk)**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries about EXCEL.EXE creating file streams. The files mentioned are in the Temp directory and have names like \"1680A406.xlsx:Zone.Identifier\". Zone.Identifier is something I remember being related to Windows' zone identifier streams, which are used to mark files downloaded from the internet. But creating these streams might be normal, like when you download a file and Windows adds that stream. However, if there's a lot of these, maybe it's part of some activity.\n\nThen there are entries about SDXHelper.exe creating various files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with names that look like they could be localization files (like az-latn-az-ui-strings-json). But why would SDXHelper.exe be creating so many of these? SDXHelper is part of Microsoft Office, right? Maybe it's related to installing or updating Office add-ins or solutions. However, the repetition of some files (like the bg-bg-ui-strings-json file appearing twice) might be a red flag. Also, the paths are in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages, which is a place where Office might store temporary or solution-specific files. But creating a lot of files here could be normal during an installation or update.\n\nThen there's an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe the user is configuring it, which is normal. But that's just one event and might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the registry events, there are multiple entries where EXCEL.EXE sets registry values. Registry changes can be risky if they're modifying important keys, but without knowing the specific keys, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that there are so many registry events from Excel might indicate some automated process or maybe a macro running that's making changes. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, putting this all together. The majority of the events seem to be related to normal operations: Excel creating shortcuts, SDXHelper creating files for Office solutions, and some registry changes. However, the repetition of certain files and the number of registry events might be worth investigating. But I'm not sure if this is malicious or just a heavy Office usage scenario. Also, the Zone.Identifier streams could be part of downloading files, but if that's the only thing happening, it's normal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SDXHelper.exe activity is part of a malicious payload. But SDXHelper is a legitimate Microsoft process. However, if there are unexpected files being created in those directories, that could be a sign. But again, without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nI think the key points here are the multiple registry changes from Excel and the repeated file creations by SDXHelper. However, without additional indicators like unusual processes, network activity, or user behavior, it's hard to confirm if this is malicious. But since the user is asking if it's interesting for investigation, the answer might be that there are some anomalies worth looking into, like the number of registry events and the file creations, even if they could be benign.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **1. Excel.EXE Activity**\n- **File Creation**: Multiple entries show `EXCEL.EXE` creating `.LNK` shortcuts in the `Recent` directory (e.g., `Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx.LNK`). This is typical for Excel when opening or saving files, but the repetition of the same shortcut might indicate repeated user actions or automation.\n- **Registry Modifications**: Over a dozen registry value changes (`Registry value set`) by `EXCEL.EXE` are logged. While Excel may modify registry keys during normal operations (e.g., add-ins, settings), the volume of changes could suggest:\n  - **Malicious Behavior**: If the changes involve sensitive keys (e.g., `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office`), this could indicate tampering or macro-induced activity.\n  - **Legitimate Use**: Normal operations (e.g., updating preferences, add-in configurations) could also explain this, but further context is needed.\n\n---\n\n### **2. SDXHelper.EXE Activity**\n- **File Creation**: `SDXHelper.EXE` (a legitimate Microsoft Office process) creates numerous JavaScript files in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`. Examples include:\n  - `bundle_1fe8fdf08a76d34524f5d50f471c45e8.js` (repeated twice).\n  - Localization files like `az-latn-az-ui-strings-json`.\n- **Potential Concerns**:\n  - **Unusual Volume**: The creation of multiple files, especially repeated ones, might indicate:\n    - **Malicious Payload**: If these files are not part of a known Office solution, they could be malicious scripts or payloads.\n    - **Legitimate Use**: SDXHelper may generate these files during solution deployment or updates, but the repetition and lack of clear naming patterns (e.g., hashes) raise flags.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Winlogbeat.EXE Activity**\n- **File Creation**: A single entry shows `winlogbeat.exe` creating a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory. This is likely part of a configuration update or log shipping setup, which is normal for the tool. No immediate concern here.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Explorer.EXE and Registry Events**\n- **Registry Modification**: `Explorer.EXE` sets a registry value, which is common for user-initiated changes (e.g., policy settings, file associations). No clear malicious intent here.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Indicators for Investigation**\n- **Anomalies**:\n  - **Repetition**: The same files (e.g., `bundle_1fe8fdf08a76d34524f5d50f471c45e8.js`) being created multiple times by SDXHelper.\n  - **Registry Volume**: Unusual number of registry changes by Excel, which may indicate tampering or macro execution.\n- **Contextual Gaps**:\n  - **File Contents**: The actual content of the JavaScript files created by SDXHelper is not visible in the logs. If they contain obfuscated code or network-related instructions, this would be a red flag.\n  - **User Behavior**: Was the user actively using Office or SDXHelper during this period? If not, the activity might be automated or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Check File Contents**: Analyze the JavaScript files created by SDXHelper for suspicious code (e.g., obfuscation, network calls).\n2. **Monitor Registry Changes**: Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals** to trace the exact registry keys modified by Excel and determine their legitimacy.\n3. **Correlate with Network Activity**: Look for unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration during the same timeframe.\n4. **Verify SDXHelper Behavior**: Ensure that SDXHelper is part of a legitimate Office installation and not a rogue process.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., Excel shortcut creation, Winlogbeat file generation) is benign, the **repeated file creation by SDXHelper** and **high volume of registry changes by Excel** are **notable anomalies** that merit further investigation. These could indicate either legitimate heavy Office usage or potential malicious activity, depending on additional context."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to analyze the entire batch as a whole.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from EXCEL.EXE with the task \"Registry value set\". There are about 13 of those. Then, there are several entries from SDXHelper.exe related to file creation. The files are being created in specific paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory. The filenames look like they might be JavaScript files, possibly related to Office add-ins or solutions.\n\nNow, the key point here is whether this is normal behavior or something suspicious. Excel accessing the registry isn't inherently bad, but doing it repeatedly might be a red flag. However, the more concerning part is the SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files in the Office SolutionPackages folder. SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, particularly with add-ins and solutions. However, the creation of multiple JavaScript files with names that include hashes and language codes (like ca-es, cs-cz) might be part of a legitimate Office add-in deployment. But, the repetition and the specific paths could also be indicative of a malicious payload being installed, especially if these files are not part of a known, legitimate add-in.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the same file paths are being created multiple times. For example, the office_2e97d653...js file is created twice by SDXHelper.exe. This could be a sign of an attempt to overwrite or install multiple components, which might be part of a larger malicious activity. However, without more context, like the content of the files or additional events (like network connections to suspicious IPs, unusual process behaviors, etc.), it's a bit hard to be certain.\n\nBut given that all these events are related to Office processes and their associated helper executables, it's possible that this is part of a legitimate Office add-in installation or update. However, the sheer number of file creations and the repetition might still be worth investigating further. The presence of multiple language-specific files could be part of a legitimate localization effort, but it's also a common tactic in malware to include multiple language files to avoid detection.\n\nIn conclusion, while some of these activities could be normal, the combination of repeated registry access by Excel and multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in non-standard paths might indicate a potential security issue. Therefore, this batch of events is worth further investigation to confirm whether they are part of a legitimate process or a malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit a mix of activities that could be either legitimate or suspicious, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repeated Registry Access by `EXCEL.EXE`:**\n   - **13 events** of `EXCEL.EXE` performing \"Registry value set\" operations. While Excel may legitimately interact with the registry (e.g., for add-in configuration), **repeated or abnormal registry modifications** could indicate tampering or malicious behavior (e.g., persistence mechanisms).\n\n2. **File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Multiple files** are created in the `Microsoft Office\\SolutionPackages` directory under `AppData\\Local`. These files are JavaScript-based (e.g., `taskpane_e0bdd6190d96fa9514e08006ef2230b9.js`) and include language-specific codes (e.g., `ca-es`, `cs-cz`). \n   - **Patterns:** \n     - File names include hashes (e.g., `2e97d653...js`), which may indicate obfuscation or unique identifiers for add-ins.\n     - Some files are created **multiple times** (e.g., `office_2e97d653...js`), suggesting repeated installation or overwriting.\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Concern:**\n- **Unusual File Locations:** While `SolutionPackages` is a legitimate directory for Office add-ins, the **specific paths and filenames** (especially those with hashes) may not align with known, signed add-ins.\n- **Behavior of `SDXHelper.exe`:** This process is associated with Microsoft Office but is **not typically involved in creating JavaScript files** in the described manner. Its activity here could be **malicious** (e.g., deploying a malicious add-in) or **legitimate** (e.g., a new, untrusted add-in).\n- **Lack of Context:** No events related to network activity, process termination, or user interaction are provided, making it harder to assess intent.\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Scenarios:**\n- **Legitimate:** \n  - A user installing a **custom Office add-in** (e.g., a task pane or localization tool) might generate similar logs. \n  - The JavaScript files could be part of a **new, untrusted add-in** being deployed.\n- **Suspicious:** \n  - The **repetition of file creation** and registry access may indicate an attempt to **persist or propagate** malicious code.\n  - The use of **language-specific files** (e.g., `ca-es`, `cs-cz`) could be a tactic to **avoid detection** by mimicking legitimate localization efforts.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Verify Add-In Source:** Check if the files correspond to a **trusted Office add-in** (e.g., via digital signatures or manifest files).\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies:** Investigate for additional suspicious activities (e.g., network connections to unknown IPs, unexpected process behaviors).\n3. **Endpoint Analysis:** Use tools like **Microsoft Defender ATP** or **EDR solutions** to inspect the behavior of `SDXHelper.exe` and associated files.\n4. **User Context:** Confirm if the user has recently installed or interacted with **untrusted Office add-ins** or macros.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the activities could be **legitimate** (e.g., a new add-in deployment), the **repetition, file naming patterns, and lack of contextual clues** raise **sufficient suspicion** to warrant further investigation. This batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to the potential for malicious activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of file creation events from the Windows Event Log. The main process involved here is SDXHelper.exe, which is creating a lot of JavaScript files (with .js extensions) in the Office SolutionPackages directory. These files seem to be localized UI string files for different languages, like da-dk, fr-ca, etc. \n\nWait, but there's also an entry from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a Beats component used for shipping logs to Elasticsearch, so that might be part of a monitoring setup. But the majority of the events are from SDXHelper.exe.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe – I should check if that's a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper is associated with Microsoft's Office suite, possibly related to the setup or updates. However, the fact that it's creating so many files in the SolutionPackages folder, which is part of Office's installation directory, might be normal during an update or installation process. But I should also consider if this is a malicious activity. \n\nBut wait, the files being created are all .js files with language codes. That seems like standard localization files. However, if the user hasn't initiated an Office update or installation, this could be suspicious. Also, the presence of winlogbeat.exe might be unrelated, but it's a legitimate tool if the user is using the Elastic Stack.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repetition of SDXHelper.exe creating these files. If this is part of a normal process, there might be a pattern or a specific reason for generating so many files. But without more context, like the user's recent activities or other logs, it's hard to say. \n\nHowever, the key point here is that all the events are from legitimate processes (assuming SDXHelper and winlogbeat are genuine on this system). There's no indication of malicious activity like unexpected file types, unusual paths, or processes that don't match known legitimate ones. Therefore, the answer would be that these logs are normal, part of Office updates or setup, and the winlogbeat activity is part of log shipping. No immediate threat detected.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate normal system activity related to software updates and log shipping. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Activity**:\n   - **Purpose**: The files created by `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., `*.js` files in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`) are likely **localized UI string resources** for Microsoft Office. These files are standard during Office installations, updates, or language pack deployments.\n   - **Legitimacy**: `SDXHelper.exe` is a known legitimate process associated with Microsoft Office, often involved in setup or configuration tasks.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat.exe Activity**:\n   - **Purpose**: The file `winlogbeat.yml.new` created by `winlogbeat.exe` is part of a **log shipping configuration** (e.g., for Elastic Stack monitoring). This is a normal operation for tools like Winlogbeat, which collects and forwards logs to Elasticsearch or other destinations.\n\n3. **No Suspicious Indicators**:\n   - All file paths and processes align with legitimate software behavior.\n   - No unusual file types, unexpected directories, or signs of malware (e.g., obfuscation, unexpected network activity) are present in the logs.\n\n**Conclusion**: These logs represent routine system operations (Office updates\/localization and log shipping setup). No immediate security threats are detected."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events here are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named things like hu-hu-ui-strings-json and icon_built_in_svg_icon with long hashes. These look like resource files, maybe part of an Office add-in or some package. But why so many files being created? Also, some of the file paths are repeated, like the icon files being created twice. That might be a red flag if they're duplicates, but maybe it's just part of the installation process.\n\nThen there are events from EXCEL.EXE doing DNS queries and registry changes, and svchost.exe making registry changes. But those are common activities. However, the sheer number of file creation events by SDXHelper.exe is notable. SDXHelper is part of the Office suite, used for managing add-ins, so maybe this is related to installing or updating an add-in. But if this is a legitimate process, why so many files? Also, the presence of multiple registry events might indicate some configuration changes, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. The key here is whether there's any indication of malicious activity. The files being created are all .js files, which could be scripts. However, without more context, like the content of the files or if they're being executed, it's hard to tell. Also, the fact that SDXHelper is creating so many files in a short time might be suspicious, especially if it's not part of a known legitimate process. But if this is during an Office add-in installation, then it's normal.\n\nAnother angle: the file names include language codes (hu, it, ja, etc.), which might be part of localization resources. That makes sense for an Office add-in that supports multiple languages. However, the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times could be a sign of something wrong. Maybe the process is trying to overwrite files or there's an error in the installation.\n\nBut without seeing the actual content of the files or more context about the user's environment, it's a bit tricky. However, the fact that there's a large number of file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in the Office directory could be a sign of something unusual. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate process, but in the absence of more information, it's worth investigating further to ensure that it's not a malicious activity masquerading as a legitimate process.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries show a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation Activity:**\n   - **Volume of Events:** There are **13+ file creation events** by `SDXHelper.exe` in the `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. This is unusual for a process typically associated with managing Office add-ins, which usually does not generate this many files during normal operation.\n   - **File Patterns:** The files are named with language codes (e.g., `hu-hu-ui-strings-json`, `it-it-ui-strings-json`) and long hexadecimal hashes (e.g., `_db31d8ed8da6ede686f40face8f6c2e7.js`). These could represent localized resource files, but the repetitive creation of identical file names (e.g., `icon_built_in_svg_icon` appearing twice) may indicate **redundant operations** or potential **malicious payload delivery** (e.g., staged file drops).\n\n2. **Registry and DNS Activity:**\n   - **EXCEL.EXE and svchost.exe:** These processes show **registry modifications** and **DNS queries**, which are common during legitimate operations (e.g., updates, add-in activation). However, **no context** is provided to confirm if these actions are part of a known process or if they correlate with the file creation events.\n\n3. **Lack of Context:**\n   - **No process execution or network activity** is logged for the files created, making it unclear if they are passive resources or executable components.\n   - **No user interaction** or error messages are mentioned, which could indicate automated or stealthy behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **Unusual File Volume:** The high number of file creations by `SDXHelper.exe` (a legitimate Office process) could indicate **malware masquerading as a trusted component**, especially if the files are not part of a known Office add-in or update.\n- **Language-Specific Files:** The presence of language-specific files (e.g., `kk-kz`, `km-kh`) might be legitimate for internationalization, but the lack of metadata (e.g., file content, digital signatures) makes it hard to verify.\n- **Registry Changes:** While registry modifications by `svchost.exe` and `EXCEL.EXE` are common, they could also be part of **malware persistence mechanisms** if not tied to a known legitimate process.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Files:**\n   - Analyze the content of the created `.js` files (e.g., check for obfuscation, malicious code, or references to external resources).\n   - Verify if the files are signed by Microsoft or a trusted entity.\n\n2. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for **process execution logs** (e.g., `ProcessCreate` events) to confirm if any of these files are being run.\n   - Look for **network activity** (e.g., outbound connections) from `SDXHelper.exe` or related processes.\n\n3. **Check for Known Malware:**\n   - Use threat intelligence platforms (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX) to scan the files or hash values for malicious indicators.\n\n4. **Contextual Verification:**\n   - Confirm if the user recently installed Office add-ins, updates, or software that could justify this activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activity (e.g., `EXCEL.EXE` DNS queries) appears legitimate, the **high volume of file creations by `SDXHelper.exe`** and the lack of contextual evidence (e.g., file content, user activity) **warrant further investigation**. This could be a **legitimate process** (e.g., a poorly documented Office add-in) or a **malicious actor exploiting a trusted process**."}

So, first, looking at the data. There are a bunch of entries here. The first 20 entries are all about EXCEL.EXE performing \"Registry value set\" events. Then, starting from the 21st entry, there are several entries involving SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific directories under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. \n\nHmm. The repeated registry changes by Excel might be normal, but maybe not. However, the files being created by SDXHelper.exe are in directories related to Office solution packages. The filenames include things like \"offlinefiles\" and \"taskpane.js\". That makes me think these could be part of a malicious payload or an add-in. \n\nWait, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. I should check if that's a legitimate process. If not, then creating these files might be suspicious. Also, the fact that multiple files are being created in different package directories could indicate an attempt to install or deploy something. \n\nBut then again, some of these files might be part of legitimate Office add-ins or updates. However, the combination of multiple registry changes by Excel and file creation by SDXHelper.exe might be a red flag. The confidence here is a bit tricky. Since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the unusual process names and the file paths are suspicious. \n\nI think the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of these events could indicate a potential security threat, even if it's not confirmed. The justification would be the unusual process names and the creation of files in sensitive directories. Confidence around 0.7 because it's not definitive but the pattern is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by EXCEL.EXE combined with SDXHelper.exe creating numerous JavaScript files in Office SolutionPackages directories suggests potential malicious activity, such as add-in deployment or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are five entries here, all from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. Each one is a file creation event under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files being created are all JavaScript files with names that look like language-specific UI strings, like mk-mk, ml-in, mr-in, and nb-no. \n\nHmm, first thing I notice is that SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. I know that some legitimate software might use such names, but Office typically doesn't create files in the SolutionPackages directory with these names. The paths are in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office folder, which is a common location for Office add-ins or solutions.\n\nNow, the fact that multiple files are being created in quick succession by the same process might be suspicious. It's possible that this is part of a normal installation or update, but the repetition of the same file name (like the third and fourth entries are identical) could indicate an error or maybe an attempt to overwrite or inject malicious code. \n\nAlso, the file names include language codes, which might be part of a legitimate localization process. However, the presence of multiple such files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory could be unusual. I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is associated with some third-party software or malware. \n\nAnother point is the use of the FileCreate rule. If these events are being logged by a security tool, it's possible that the creation of these files is flagged as unusual. Since all events are from the same process and location, it might be part of a larger malicious activity, like downloading and executing payloads or modifying the Office environment.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a legitimate reason. For example, if a user is installing a language pack or a custom solution for Office, these files could be part of that. However, the repetition of the same file name might be a red flag. Also, the confidence here is a bit tricky. Without more context, like other events or process behaviors, it's hard to be certain. But given the process name, the location, and the repetitive file creation, I'd lean towards this being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory with suspicious language-specific JS filenames.
