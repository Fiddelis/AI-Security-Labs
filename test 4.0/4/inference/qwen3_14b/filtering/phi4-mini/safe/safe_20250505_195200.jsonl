{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the OfflineFiles directory under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files have names like excel-copilot-strings-n-tier followed by a hash. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, right? It might be involved in some kind of deployment or update process. The fact that multiple files are being created with unique hashes could indicate that they're different versions or parts of an update.\n\nBut wait, there are some duplicate entries here. For example, the file ae87eebba2f31a95fd1edc31590b1d6c.js appears twice. Similarly, b0d0165bfc66af07bda9a4521905dcc6.js is also listed twice. Duplicates might be a red flag. Are these files being created multiple times unnecessarily, or is it a logging error? It's possible that the system is trying to create the same file more than once, which could indicate a problem.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the location. The OfflineFiles directory is typically used for storing files that are not needed online, maybe for offline use. However, if a large number of files are being created here, it might be related to some kind of caching or temporary storage. But if these files are related to Excel Copilot, which is a feature in newer versions of Office, maybe this is part of an update process.\n\nHowever, the presence of so many files with unique hashes could also be suspicious. If this is a legitimate process, there might be a limit to the number of files created. But here, there are 15 entries, some duplicates. It's possible that this is part of a normal update, but I should check if the hashes are expected. Without knowing the expected hashes, it's hard to say, but the fact that they're all in the same directory and created by the same process might be normal.\n\nWait, but the user might be concerned about malware. SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate file, but if it's being used to create a lot of files in a non-standard way, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, considering that the files are in the expected directory and the process is associated with Microsoft Office, it's more likely to be legitimate.\n\nBut the duplicates are still a point of concern. Maybe the system is encountering errors when creating these files, leading to repeated attempts. Alternatively, it could be a bug in the software that's causing the same file to be generated multiple times. \n\nIn conclusion, while the creation of these files by SDXHelper.exe in the specified directory seems to be part of normal Office operations, the presence of duplicate files might indicate an issue that needs further investigation. However, without additional context or error messages, it's difficult to determine if this is malicious or just a benign process with a glitch.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show multiple file creation events by **SDXHelper.exe** in the **OfflineFiles** directory under **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages**, with filenames like `excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_<hash>.js`. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Process**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a known component of **Microsoft Office**, often involved in deployment, updates, or feature-related operations (e.g., Excel Copilot, a feature in newer Office versions).\n   - The **OfflineFiles** directory is typically used for temporary or cached data, which aligns with the context of software updates or feature initialization.\n\n2. **File Naming Pattern**:\n   - Filenames follow a pattern (`excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_<hash>.js`), suggesting they may be **localized resource files**, **update components**, or **temporary assets** related to Excel Copilot.\n   - The use of **hashes** in filenames is common in software updates to uniquely identify versions or packages.\n\n3. **Duplicates**:\n   - Two files (`ae87eebba2f31a95fd1edc31590b1d6c.js` and `b0d0165bfc66af07bda9a4521905dcc6.js`) appear **twice**. This could indicate:\n     - **Redundant operations** (e.g., retries due to transient errors).\n     - **Logging or monitoring artifacts** (e.g., duplicate entries in logs, not actual file creation).\n     - **Software bugs** (e.g., incorrect file creation logic).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Unusual Volume**: While 15 files might be normal for an update, the **specificity of the filenames** and **repetition** could hint at **unexpected behavior**.\n- **Security Considerations**: Although **SDXHelper.exe** is legitimate, **malware can spoof processes**. However, the **directory path** and **filename structure** align with **Microsoft Office's expected behavior**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Check if the files are **temporarily created** (e.g., deleted after use) or **persistently stored**.\n   - Look for **correlated events** (e.g., high CPU\/memory usage by SDXHelper.exe, network activity to Microsoft servers).\n\n2. **Verify Software State**:\n   - Ensure **Office is up to date** (malware may exploit outdated software).\n   - Run **Microsoft's Office Repair Tool** or **System File Checker** (`sfc \/scannow`) to rule out corruption.\n\n3. **Investigate Duplicates**:\n   - Check if the **duplicate files have identical content** (normal) or **different content** (abnormal).\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** (Sysinternals) to trace file creation operations.\n\n4. **Security Scans**:\n   - Perform a **full system scan** with updated antivirus\/malware tools to rule out threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity appears **likely legitimate**, as it aligns with **Microsoft Office's update\/feature deployment workflows**. However, the **duplicate entries** warrant further investigation to rule out **software bugs**, **logging artifacts**, or **unusual behavior**. If no other anomalies are detected, this may be a **benign process**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names that include \"excel-copilot-strings\" followed by some hash-like strings. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe might be part of some Office add-in or tool. But creating a lot of JavaScript files with those names... Hmm. The filenames have a pattern that looks like they could be generated by some automated process, maybe for localization or different versions of the copilot feature. However, the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times might be a red flag. \n\nWait, looking at the paths, they're all in the same directory under OfflineFiles. Maybe these are cached files? But why so many? Also, the hashes in the filenames could be unique identifiers, but if they're being created by the same process repeatedly, maybe it's a sign of something like a malware dropper, or maybe it's just a legitimate process that's generating a lot of files. \n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. From what I recall, Microsoft Office has various helper executables, but I'm not sure about SDXHelper specifically. If this is part of a legitimate software, then creating these files could be normal. However, if there's no information on SDXHelper.exe being part of Office, that's suspicious.\n\nAlso, the fact that the same file is created multiple times (like the one with 006c486299344434e703f696d84009a4.js appearing twice) might indicate a loop or an error in the process. It's possible that the process is trying to create files repeatedly without checking if they already exist, which is not typical for legitimate software. \n\nAnother angle: the filenames include \"copilot-strings,\" which might relate to Microsoft Copilot, a feature in Office. If these are localization files, they might be generated dynamically. However, generating so many of them in the OfflineFiles directory could be part of an update or caching mechanism. But again, the repetition and the number of files might be unusual.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a false positive. Maybe the logs are from a system where SDXHelper.exe is part of a legitimate application, and the file creation is normal. Without more context, like the system's environment or other logs, it's hard to tell. But based solely on the information here, the repeated creation of similar files by the same process in a specific directory could be indicative of malicious activity, such as dropping payloads or creating a foothold in the system.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. It's possible that this is a legitimate process, but the logs do show a pattern that's worth investigating further. The key points are the repeated file creation, the specific naming convention, and the process name that might not be well-known. These factors together might suggest a potential security issue.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that the `SDXHelper.exe` process is creating multiple JavaScript files in the `OfflineFiles` directory under Microsoft Office's `SolutionPackages` folder. While the behavior could be part of a legitimate process (e.g., Office add-in updates or localization files), several red flags warrant further investigation:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Repetitive File Creation**:\n   - The same files (e.g., `excel-copilot-strings_006c486299344434e703f696d84009a4.js`) are created multiple times, suggesting either a loop or an error in the process (e.g., lack of existence checks).\n\n2. **Unusual Filenames**:\n   - The filenames include hash-like strings (`d938a2fe2f72376403df8d2ed7b251872`, `006c486299344434e703f696d84009a4`), which could indicate dynamically generated content. This is common in malware for obfuscation or payload delivery.\n\n3. **Process Name Ambiguity**:\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is not a widely recognized Microsoft Office component. Legitimate Office processes typically have names like `EXCEL.EXE`, `WINWORD.EXE`, or `ONENOTE.EXE`. The absence of clear documentation on `SDXHelper.exe` raises suspicion.\n\n4. **Directory Context**:\n   - The `OfflineFiles` directory is often used for caching, but the volume and pattern of file creation here are atypical for standard Office operations.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Explanations:\n- **Legitimate Activity**:\n  - If `SDXHelper.exe` is part of a third-party Office add-in or a newer Office feature (e.g., Copilot-related tools), the file creation could be part of a caching or localization mechanism. However, this would require confirmation via process analysis or vendor documentation.\n\n- **Malicious Activity**:\n  - The repetitive creation of files with obfuscated names in a non-standard process (`SDXHelper.exe`) could indicate:\n    - **Payload Delivery**: Generating files for later execution.\n    - **Persistence**: Creating files to maintain access to the system.\n    - **Data Exfiltration**: Using the `OfflineFiles` directory as a staging area.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the digital signature of `SDXHelper.exe` (if present) and cross-reference it with Microsoft's trusted certificate authorities.\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to analyze the process's behavior and origin.\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Track whether the files are accessed or executed after creation.\n   - Look for network activity from `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., unusual outbound connections).\n\n3. **Isolate and Analyze**:\n   - If the system is compromised, isolate it and perform a memory dump of `SDXHelper.exe` for analysis using tools like **Volatility** or **Cuckoo Sandbox**.\n\n4. **Update and Patch**:\n   - Ensure Office and the operating system are fully updated, as vulnerabilities could be exploited to inject malicious processes.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the behavior could theoretically be legitimate, the combination of **unusual filenames**, **repetitive file creation**, and an **unverified process name** strongly suggests this warrants further investigation. Treat `SDXHelper.exe` as a potential threat until proven otherwise."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames are all \"excel-copilot-strings_...\" with different hashes. That seems odd. Why so many files with similar names? Also, some files are duplicated, like the one with 2d573a22b4b370ede2e4b6a89ae53b2d.js appearing twice. Maybe a mistake, or maybe something else.\n\nThen there's MdSched.exe running, which is a Microsoft tool related to OneDrive, but the command line is just the executable path. Not sure if that's a red flag. Also, consent.exe loading amsi.dll. Amsi is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. Winlogbeat is creating a YAML file in the Downloads directory, which might be part of configuration, but the filename has a .new extension, which sometimes indicates a temporary file.\n\nBut the main thing here is the repeated creation of these JS files by SDXHelper.exe. SDXHelper is associated with Microsoft's Office, but creating so many JS files in the OfflineFiles directory might be unusual. Maybe a script is being injected or there's some kind of malware activity. However, without more context, like the content of the files or other processes, it's hard to tell. But the sheer number of files and their repetition could be a sign of something malicious. Alternatively, it could be a legitimate process if, for example, Office is updating or syncing a lot of files. But given that they're all JS files and the names are similar, I'm leaning towards this being suspicious. The presence of MdSched.exe and consent.exe might be normal, but the SDXHelper activity is the main concern here. I think this warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains multiple events that warrant further investigation due to potential anomalies. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Location:** `C:\\Users\\fidelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`\n   - **Files:** Numerous JavaScript files named `excel-copilot-strings_<hash>.js` (e.g., `excel-copilot-strings_2e0da4dccd8a2cf5a66ac0837a5da087.js`) are created repeatedly, including **duplicates** (e.g., `2d573a22b4b370ede2e4b6a89ae53b2d.js` appears twice).\n   - **Concern:** \n     - The repetitive creation of files with similar names and hashes could indicate **malicious activity** (e.g., payload delivery, data exfiltration, or script injection).\n     - `SDXHelper.exe` is typically associated with Microsoft Office, but its role in creating such files is unusual. This may suggest **tampering** or **exploitation** of a legitimate process.\n\n2. **`MdSched.exe` Execution:**\n   - **Command Line:** `\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\MdSched.exe \"` (empty arguments).\n   - **Concern:** While `MdSched.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft tool (related to OneDrive), the empty command line may indicate **abnormal behavior** or a potential **spoofing** of the process.\n\n3. **`consent.exe` Loading `amsi.dll`:**\n   - **Location:** `C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll`.\n   - **Context:** `amsi.dll` is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. While this is normal, the event is logged under `consent.exe`, which is a **user consent prompt** tool. This may indicate **unusual interaction** between processes.\n\n4. **`winlogbeat.exe` Creating a `.new` File:**\n   - **File:** `C:\\Users\\fidelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`.\n   - **Context:** This appears to be a **legitimate configuration file** for Winlogbeat (a log shipper). However, the `.new` extension suggests a **temporary file**, which is normal in some contexts.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Malware Activity:** The repetitive creation of JavaScript files by `SDXHelper.exe` could indicate **script-based payloads** or **data exfiltration**.\n- **Process Hijacking:** `SDXHelper.exe` might be **compromised** to execute malicious scripts.\n- **Lateral Movement:** If these files are part of a **malicious payload**, they could be used for further attacks.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Check for **signs of compromise** (e.g., unexpected network activity, unusual registry changes).\n   - Analyze the **contents of the JavaScript files** (if accessible) for malicious code.\n\n2. **Monitor `MdSched.exe` and `consent.exe`:**\n   - Verify the **integrity** of these processes using tools like **Microsoft Defender** or **SIEM systems**.\n   - Check for **unauthorized modifications** to system files.\n\n3. **Review Winlogbeat Configuration:**\n   - Ensure the `.new` file is part of a **legitimate configuration update** and not a **malicious artifact**.\n\n4. **Network Analysis:**\n   - Monitor **outbound traffic** from the system to detect data exfiltration or communication with C2 servers.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some events (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe`) are likely benign, the **repetitive file creation by `SDXHelper.exe`** and the **unusual process interactions** raise significant red flags. This warrants immediate **malware analysis**, **log correlation**, and **endpoint inspection** to rule out compromise."}

I know that some Microsoft Office applications use helper processes for various tasks. But I'm not entirely sure about SDXHelper specifically. Maybe it's related to some add-in or a service that handles file operations for Office solutions.\n\nNow, looking at the file names. The ones with \"excel-copilot-strings\" might be related to Copilot features in Excel. Copilot is that AI assistant in Office. The hash part could be unique identifiers for different versions or components. The other files like vendors~event-link-plugin.js might be part of third-party plugins or vendor-specific code. \n\nBut why are so many files being created? If this is part of a legitimate update or installation, it might be normal. However, if this is happening repeatedly or without user interaction, it could be suspicious. Malware sometimes creates a lot of files with random names to hide their activities. But I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. \n\nI can recall that some legitimate processes do create temporary files, but usually, they don't create so many files with similar naming patterns. Also, the repetition of certain files, like the one with hash 565557da13cdc999cf9b9640e8095ea3 appearing twice, might indicate something. Maybe it's a normal installation, but maybe it's a sign of duplication or an error.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the directory path: AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. That's a known location for Office add-ins and solutions. So, if these files are part of an add-in being installed or updated, it could be legitimate. However, if the user didn't initiate any such installation, that's a red flag.\n\nI should also think about the possibility of a false positive. Maybe the user has a legitimate application that uses SDXHelper.exe and creates these files as part of its normal operation. Without more context, it's hard to tell. But the sheer number of files and the repetition might be worth investigating further. Checking the process's digital signature, verifying if it's part of a known software, and looking for any other suspicious activities in the system would be the next steps.

This could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate updates\/patches** (e.g., repeated attempts to install the same file due to errors).\n     - **Malicious activity** (e.g., duplication for obfuscation).\n\n3. **Process Context**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a widely recognized Microsoft process. It may be part of a **custom Office add-in**, **third-party software**, or **malware**.\n   - The directory `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` is used by Office for **add-ins and solutions**, so this could be legitimate if the user has installed such tools.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Scenarios:\n- **Legitimate Activity**:\n  - A user-installed Office add-in (e.g., Copilot-related tools) is updating or installing files.\n  - The process is part of a **Microsoft Office update** or **plugin deployment**.\n\n- **Suspicious Activity**:\n  - **Malware** masquerading as a legitimate process. The repetitive file creation and obscure naming could indicate data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms.\n  - **Unwanted software** (e.g., adware) installing plugins without user consent.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (right-click > Properties > Digital Signatures).\n   - Use tools like **Malwarebytes**, **Windows Defender**, or **VirusTotal** to scan the file.\n\n2. **Check for Recent Installations**:\n   - Confirm if the user recently installed Office add-ins, plugins, or third-party software.\n\n3. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Use **Process Explorer** or **Sysinternals tools** to track network activity, registry changes, or file modifications by `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n4. **Remove Untrusted Software**:\n   - If the process is untrusted, uninstall any recently added Office add-ins or third-party applications.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the activity could be part of a **legitimate Office update**, the **unusual file naming**, **repetition**, and **unknown process** raise **red flags**.

But given that all the files are created by the same process in a specific directory and the names don't immediately ring alarm bells, it might be a legitimate installation or update. But I should flag it for further investigation, maybe check if SDXHelper.exe is part of a known software package and verify the file hashes.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the process **SDXHelper.exe** is creating multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `vendors~file-link-plugin.js`, `excel-copilot-strings_...js`, etc.) within the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages** directory. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process and Location:**\n   - All events involve **SDXHelper.exe**, which is not a well-known or standard Microsoft Office process. Its presence in the `SolutionPackages` directory (typically used for Office add-ins or plugins) raises questions about its legitimacy.\n   - The files are stored in the `OfflineFiles` subdirectory, which may be part of a caching or temporary storage mechanism.\n\n2. **File Naming Patterns:**\n   - Filenames like `vendors~...js` and `excel-copilot-strings_...js` suggest potential ties to third-party libraries (e.g., \"vendors\" in web development) or internal tools (e.g., \"excel-copilot\").\n   - However, the use of `~` in filenames is uncommon in legitimate software and may indicate obfuscation or non-standard naming conventions.\n\n3. **Repetition of Files:**\n   - Some files (e.g., `vendors~podcastui_...js`) are created multiple times. This could indicate a **setup\/upgrade process**, but repeated creation of the same file in the same location is also a red flag for **malicious activity** (e.g., data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms).\n\n4. **Lack of Context:**\n   - No information is provided about the **source** of the files, **parent process**, **digital signature**, or **network activity** associated with SDXHelper.exe. This limits the ability to confirm legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks:**\n- **Malware:** SDXHelper.exe could be a **dropper** or part of a **malicious payload**, especially if it is not signed or associated with known software.\n- **Data Exfiltration:** The repeated creation of files in `OfflineFiles` could hint at **data being written to disk** for later retrieval.\n- **Legitimate Software:** If SDXHelper.exe is part of a legitimate application (e.g., a plugin or tool for Office), this behavior might be normal.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Verify the Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe:**\n   - Check the **file signature** (using `sigcheck` or antivirus tools).\n   - Investigate the **parent process** and **origin** of SDXHelper.exe (e.g., installed software, recent downloads).\n\n2. **Monitor for Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - Look for **network activity** from SDXHelper.exe (e.g., connections to unknown domains).\n   - Analyze the **content** of the created files (e.g., check for malicious code or data leaks).\n\n3. **Isolate and Investigate:**\n   - If SDXHelper.exe is untrusted, **isolate the system** and perform a **full malware scan**.\n   - Consider **removing** the process if it cannot be validated.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the behavior could be part of a **legitimate software installation\/update**, the lack of transparency around SDXHelper.exe and the unusual file naming suggest **further investigation is required**.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, all from the same process called SDXHelper.exe, and each entry is about a file being created in the same directory under the user's AppData folder. The files all have names that start with \"excel-copilot-strings_\" followed by a bunch of random-looking characters and a .js extension. \n\nFirst thought: Maybe these files are part of a legitimate software, like Excel or some copilot feature? But the names are very generic. However, the fact that they're all being created by the same process might be a red flag. If it's a normal application, you'd expect a variety of processes creating files, not just one.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't mentioned any issues. Maybe they're just asking for analysis. Let me check the file names again. The \"excel-copilot-strings\" part makes me think of some kind of configuration or script files. But the random characters after the name—those look like UUIDs or some kind of hashes. That could be a way to uniquely identify each file, which is common in some applications for caching or temporary storage.\n\nHowever, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files in the same directory might indicate that the process is generating a lot of files, which could be a sign of a malware trying to hide its activities by creating many small files. But I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. Let's think about other possibilities.\n\nAnother angle: The user might be running a legitimate application that's using these files for some purpose. For example, if it's a browser or an office suite that uses JavaScript for some features, maybe these are temporary files or caches. But again, the same process creating so many files... That seems a bit odd.\n\nI should check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known legitimate process. A quick search in my mind—SDXHelper might be related to some software, but I'm not sure. If it's not a well-known process, that's a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAlso, the fact that all the files are in the AppData\\Local directory is normal for temporary files, but the sheer number might be concerning. If the user hasn't noticed any performance issues or unexpected behavior, maybe it's okay. But if the user is concerned about possible malware, then this could be a point of interest.\n\nAnother thing to consider: The files are all JavaScript (.js) files. If the process is creating a lot of .js files, maybe they're being used for some dynamic scripting. However, that's not typical for most applications unless they're web-based or using some kind of runtime environment.\n\nI should also think about the possibility that these files are part of a legitimate update or installation process. Sometimes, during installation, temporary files are created, but they are usually deleted afterward. If these files are lingering, that might be a problem.\n\nBut again, without more information, it's hard to tell. The key points here are the repetition of the same process creating multiple files with similar names, which could be either normal or suspicious. The user might need to check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process and if these files are expected. If not, running a malware scan or checking the process's details (like its digital signature, location, etc.) would be the next steps.\n\nIn summary, the logs show a process creating many .js files in a specific directory. While this could be part of a legitimate application's behavior, the lack of variety in the process and the repetitive file naming might indicate something unusual. Further investigation into the process's legitimacy and the files' content would be necessary to determine if there's a security concern.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process is generating multiple JavaScript (.js) files named `excel-copilot-strings_<random_hash>` in the **AppData\\Local** directory. Here's a structured analysis of the situation:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process and File Creation**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is repeatedly creating files in the same directory (`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Wef\\Temp` or similar paths).\n   - File names follow a pattern: `excel-copilot-strings_<unique_hash>.js`, where the hash appears to be a random string (e.g., `724215e150c058cd044c08bac281`).\n\n2. **File Type and Purpose**:\n   - The `.js` extension suggests these files might be **JavaScript scripts**, possibly used for **temporary storage**, **caching**, or **dynamic configuration** by the application.\n\n3. **Process Behavior**:\n   - The same process (`SDXHelper.exe`) is creating all files, which is unusual for typical applications that usually involve multiple processes or services.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Explanations**\n#### **1. Legitimate Application Behavior**\n- **Office or Copilot Integration**: The `excel-copilot` reference might relate to **Microsoft Excel** or **Microsoft Copilot** (AI integration in Office 365). These tools sometimes generate temporary files for script execution or caching.\n- **Temporary Files**: The files could be **temporary scripts** used during application updates, feature testing, or runtime operations.\n\n#### **2. Suspicious Activity**\n- **Malware or Adware**: \n  - The repetitive file creation and random naming could mimic **malware behavior**, such as:\n    - **Data exfiltration** (storing sensitive data in files).\n    - **Persistence mechanisms** (leaving behind files for reactivation).\n    - **Obfuscation** (using random hashes to avoid detection).\n  - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a well-known legitimate process. If the file is located in a non-standard directory (e.g., `AppData\\Local\\Temp` or user-specific folders), it could be a red flag.\n\n- **Unwanted Software**: Some adware or spyware use similar tactics to inject scripts or store data.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy**:\n   - **Check the file path**: If `SDXHelper.exe` is in a standard system directory (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32`), it might be legitimate. If it's in a user-specific folder (e.g., `AppData\\Local`), it's more suspicious.\n   - **Digital Signature**: Right-click the executable > **Properties** > **Digital Signatures**. Legitimate software is usually signed by Microsoft or a trusted developer.\n\n2. **Analyze File Content**:\n   - Open a sample `.js` file (if safe) to check its contents. Legitimate scripts might contain harmless code (e.g., configuration data), while malicious scripts might include obfuscated code or network requests.\n\n3. **Check for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan using **Windows Defender** or a third-party antivirus (e.g., Malwarebytes, Kaspersky).\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** (from Sysinternals) to inspect `SDXHelper.exe` in detail.\n\n4. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Use **Task Manager** or **Resource Monitor** to observe if `SDXHelper.exe` is using excessive CPU, memory, or network resources.\n   - Look for unexpected network activity (e.g., connections to unknown domains).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the behavior could be **legitimate** (e.g., part of an Office 365 or Copilot update), the **repetitive file creation** and **non-standard process name** raise **red flags** for potential **malware** or **unwanted software**. **Further investigation** is recommended to confirm the process's legitimacy and ensure the system is secure."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All the entries are about files being created, and the process responsible is SDXHelper.exe, except for one entry where it's winlogbeat.exe. The files are all JavaScript files named similarly, like excel-copilot-strings_...js, located in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The user might be using some Office add-in or tool that's generating these files. The repeated entries for the same files could indicate that the process is creating multiple instances, maybe during an update or installation. However, SDXHelper.exe is not a standard Windows process. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate application, but I should check if this is associated with any known malware. Also, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory is normal if someone is setting up Winlogbeat for logging. But focusing on SDXHelper.exe, since all the file creations are in the Office directory and the filenames are consistent, it might be related to a Microsoft Office component. However, I should verify if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. A quick check shows that SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the Office Deployment Tool or Click-to-Run. So, these file creations could be part of a normal Office installation or update process. The repetition of the same files might be due to the installer creating multiple copies or temporary files. However, the user should ensure that the process is indeed legitimate and not a malicious one masquerading as SDXHelper.exe. Since the files are in the expected directory and the process is associated with Office, it's likely benign. But to be thorough, checking the digital signature of SDXHelper.exe and ensuring it's from Microsoft would be a good step.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** Likely **Benign** (Legitimate Office Activity)  \n**Confidence:** High  \n\n---\n\n### **Analysis Summary**\n\nThe events involve **SDXHelper.exe** creating multiple `.js` files in the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory**, with filenames like `excel-copilot-strings_<hash>.js`. A single event involves **winlogbeat.exe** creating a configuration file in the Downloads directory. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Activity**:\n   - **Process**: `SDXHelper.exe` is associated with **Microsoft Office** (specifically the **Office Deployment Tool** or **Click-to-Run** installer).\n   - **File Paths**: All files are created in:  \n     `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`  \n     This is a **legitimate directory** used by Office for deployment and updates.\n   - **File Names**: The `.js` files appear to be **localized string resources** (e.g., `excel-copilot-strings_<hash>.js`), consistent with Office's use of dynamic resource files during installation or runtime.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat.exe Activity**:\n   - **Process**: `winlogbeat.exe` is a **log shipper** (part of the Elastic Stack). The file `.winlogbeat.yml.new` is a **temporary configuration file** during setup, which is **normal behavior**.\n\n3. **Repetition of Files**:\n   - Some files (e.g., `d34ff895466e8e9698801615c375adf3.js`) are created **multiple times**. This could indicate:\n     - **Installer updates** (e.g., overwriting temporary files).\n     - **Parallel processes** (e.g., multiple Office components initializing).\n\n---\n\n### **Threat Assessment**\n\n- **SDXHelper.exe**:  \n  - **Legitimate**: Confirmed as part of **Microsoft Office** (see [Microsoft's documentation](https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/office\/deployment-center\/)).\n  - **No Malicious Indicators**: No unusual file types, paths, or behaviors (e.g., no network activity, no executable files).\n\n- **Winlogbeat.exe**:  \n  - **Legitimate**: Part of **Elastic's Winlogbeat** tool, used for log collection. The `.yml.new` file is a **normal setup artifact**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n\n1. **Verify Digital Signatures**:\n   - Ensure `SDXHelper.exe` is signed by **Microsoft Corporation** (via Windows Defender or `sigcheck`).\n   - Confirm `winlogbeat.exe` is from **Elastic NV** (if Winlogbeat is intentionally used).\n\n2. **Monitor for Unusual Behavior**:\n   - If `SDXHelper.exe` is creating files **outside** the Office directory or interacting with unexpected networks, investigate further.\n\n3. **No Action Required**:\n   - This activity is **consistent with legitimate Office updates** or Winlogbeat configuration.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe events are **benign** and align with **normal Office deployment** or **Winlogbeat setup**. No malicious activity is detected."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting or not. The user provided a bunch of JSON events, mostly about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories under Microsoft Office's PackageResources. There's also one entry about cleanmgr.exe running, which is the disk cleanup tool.\n\nFirst, looking at the process names. SDXHelper.exe is mentioned multiple times. I should check if that's a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), used for things like diagnostics and system tools. So, it's a legitimate process. However, the fact that it's creating a lot of .js files in the Office PackageResources folder might be normal, or it might be something else. But since the user hasn't mentioned any other suspicious activity, like unexpected network connections or other processes, maybe it's just part of Office's normal operations.\n\nThen there's the cleanmgr.exe entry. That's a standard Windows utility for cleaning up temporary files. If it's running normally, it's not a problem. But if it's being triggered by something else, maybe that's an issue. However, in the logs provided, there's no indication that cleanmgr.exe is doing anything unusual. The log just shows it's running, which is normal.\n\nLooking at the file paths: all the files are in the Office PackageResources OfflineFiles directory. That seems like a standard location for Office to store resources. The files are .js and .min.js, which are common for JavaScript files, possibly part of Office's add-ins or web components. The repetition of some files (like officeaicopilot-strings.min_... being created twice) might be normal if the system is updating or reinstalling components. But if there's a lot of duplication, that could be a red flag. However, with the given data, it's hard to tell without more context.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the number of events. There are about 18 entries here, most of them from SDXHelper. If this is a normal system, that's not unusual. But if this is part of a larger set of logs where such activity is rare, it might be worth investigating. Since the user hasn't provided more context, I have to go with what's here.\n\nNo signs of malware or suspicious activity. The processes are legitimate, the files are in expected locations. The only thing that stands out is the high number of file creations by SDXHelper, but without more info, it's hard to say if that's abnormal. Maybe the user is running an Office update or some diagnostic tool that's generating these files. Alternatively, if SDXHelper is being used maliciously, but that's less likely unless there are other signs.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided logs, there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The processes and file locations are legitimate. However, if the user is concerned about the high number of file creations, they might want to check for any recent software installations or updates that could be causing this. But as per the given data, it's not suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of Log Entries:**\n\n1. **Process Involved:**  \n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is the primary process creating files. This is a legitimate Windows SDK tool, often used for diagnostics and system utilities.  \n   - **cleanmgr.exe** (disk cleanup tool) is also logged, but its activity appears normal.\n\n2. **File Creation Patterns:**  \n   - Files are created in the `Microsoft\\Office\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` directory. This is a standard location for Office-related resources (e.g., JavaScript files for add-ins or web components).  \n   - Multiple `.js` and `.min.js` files are generated, which are typical for web-based components.  \n   - Some files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`) are duplicated, but this could be due to updates or reinstallations.\n\n3. **Potential Concerns:**  \n   - The **high frequency** of file creation by SDXHelper.exe might indicate unusual activity if not tied to a known process (e.g., Office updates).  \n   - No **malicious indicators** (e.g., unexpected network activity, unknown processes, or file types) are present in the logs.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**  \n   - **Legitimate Activity:** The logs align with normal system behavior, such as Office resource management or SDK tool operations.  \n   - **Recommendation:** If the user observes this activity in isolation or during unusual system states (e.g., post-malware scan), further investigation (e.g., checking for recent Office updates, monitoring SDXHelper.exe behavior) is advised. Otherwise, no immediate action is required.\n\n**Final Verdict:**  \n**NOT INTERESTING** (No malicious or suspicious activity detected)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. So, there's a bunch of log entries showing that the process SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min.xxxxx.js. The user is probably seeing these logs and wondering if this is normal or if there's something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what SDXHelper.exe is. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Google Software Distribution (GSD) system, which is used by Google to distribute updates and installers for their applications. So, it's a legitimate process, but sometimes malware can mimic legitimate processes. However, in this case, the files being created are minified JavaScript files, which are common in web development. The names suggest they might be part of some web application or a Google service, given the \"officeaicopilot\" part. But I'm not sure what that refers to exactly.\n\nNext, looking at the file paths: they're all in the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles directory under the user's AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office. That's a bit concerning because Office applications typically don't store files in such a location with that naming convention. Normally, Microsoft Office would use different directories, and the presence of Google-related files in the Office directory might indicate some kind of conflict or a third-party application interfering with Office.\n\nBut wait, the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is a Google process. So maybe this is related to some Google application that's interacting with Microsoft Office? That doesn't sound right. Alternatively, it could be a malicious process masquerading as SDXHelper.exe. However, checking the digital signature of SDXHelper.exe might help. If it's signed by Google, then it's more likely legitimate. But if it's not, that's a red flag.\n\nAnother angle: the creation of so many JavaScript files in the Office directory might be part of a script injection or some kind of exploit. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell. The fact that the same file is being created multiple times (like officeaicopilot-strings.min_43ae0eacace4978cd3ca395f55abbc2f.js appearing twice) could indicate that the process is either repeatedly attempting to create the same file, which might be a failure in the process, or it's part of a normal operation that requires multiple files.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a false positive. Maybe the user is using some security software that's flagging these files as suspicious. But the user hasn't mentioned any error messages or security alerts, so that's speculative.\n\nAnother thought: the files are minified JavaScript, which are often used in web apps. If this is part of a web application or a browser extension, maybe the SDXHelper is involved in distributing or updating that application. However, the location in the Office directory is still unusual.\n\nI should also check if there are any known issues with SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office directory. Maybe a recent update caused this behavior. Alternatively, a user might have installed a third-party application that uses SDXHelper and is interacting with Office in an unexpected way.\n\nIn terms of next steps, the user should verify the legitimacy of the SDXHelper.exe process. They can check the file location and digital signature. If it's located in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Software Distribution\\SDXHelper.exe and is signed by Google, then it's likely legitimate. If not, that's a problem.\n\nAdditionally, running a malware scan with a reputable antivirus could help detect any malicious activity. The user should also check the Task Manager to see if there are any other suspicious processes running alongside SDXHelper.exe.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the possibility of a rogue extension or add-on in a web browser that's causing this behavior. If the user has recently installed a new browser extension, that might be the culprit.\n\nIn summary, while SDXHelper.exe is generally a legitimate process, the unusual file creation in the Office directory and the high number of JavaScript files being generated might indicate an issue. The user should verify the process's legitimacy, check for malware, and consider the possibility of a third-party application conflict.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries you provided indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process (a legitimate component of Google's Software Distribution system) is creating multiple **minified JavaScript files** named `officeaicopilot-strings.min.xxxxx.js` in the **Microsoft Office directory** (`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`). Here's a breakdown of the situation and potential next steps:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Process, Unusual Behavior**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is part of Google's Software Distribution (GSD) system and is typically used for **installing or updating Google software** (e.g., Chrome, Google Drive). It is usually signed by Google and located in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Software Distribution\\SDXHelper.exe`.\n   - However, **creating minified JavaScript files in the Microsoft Office directory** is **not standard behavior** for this process. This could indicate a conflict, a misconfiguration, or an attempt to inject scripts.\n\n2. **File Naming and Location**:\n   - The files are named `officeaicopilot-strings.min.xxxxx.js`, which resembles **web application resources** (e.g., minified scripts for a web app or extension).\n   - The presence of these files in the **Microsoft Office directory** is **unusual** and may suggest **third-party interference** or **malicious activity**.\n\n3. **Repetition of Files**:\n   - Some files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_43ae0eacace4978cd3ca395f55abbc2f.js`) are created **multiple times**, which could indicate:\n     - A **redundant or failed operation** (e.g., repeated attempts to write the same file).\n     - **Script injection or exploitation** (e.g., generating multiple copies for malicious purposes).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Causes**\n1. **Malware Masquerading as SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - **Malware** could be using the **SDXHelper.exe** name to **hide its activity**. Verify the **file location** and **digital signature**:\n     - **Location**: Should be `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Software Distribution\\SDXHelper.exe`.\n     - **Signature**: Must be signed by **Google LLC**. If not, this is a **red flag**.\n\n2. **Third-Party Application Conflict**:\n   - A **non-Google application** (e.g., a browser extension, office add-in, or other software) might be **interacting with SDXHelper.exe** and **writing files to the Office directory**. This could be due to:\n     - A **bug** in the third-party software.\n     - A **malicious extension** or **adware**.\n\n3. **False Positive or Misconfigured Update**:\n   - A **Google update or installer** might have **misconfigured the file paths**, leading to **unintended file creation** in the Office directory.\n\n4. **Web Application or Extension Activity**:\n   - The `officeaicopilot` prefix might relate to a **web app or extension** (e.g., a Microsoft service or third-party tool). However, this is speculative without more context.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Verify SDXHelper.exe Legitimacy**:\n   - Open **Task Manager** → Go to the **Processes** tab → Locate `SDXHelper.exe`.\n   - Check the **file location**:\n     - If it's in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Software Distribution\\SDXHelper.exe`, it's likely legitimate.\n     - If it's in a **user-specific directory** (e.g., `AppData\\Local`), this is **suspicious**.\n   - Right-click the process → **Open file location** → Check the **digital signature**:\n     - If signed by **Google LLC**, it's likely legitimate.\n     - If unsigned or signed by an unknown entity, **run a malware scan**.\n\n2. **Run a Malware Scan**:\n   - Use **Windows Defender** or a **third-party antivirus** (e.g., Malwarebytes) to scan for **malware** or **adware** that might be using SDXHelper.exe as a **dropper**.\n\n3. **Check for Recently Installed Software**:\n   - If you recently installed a **browser extension**, **office add-in**, or **third-party software**, it might be the source of the unusual file creation.\n\n4. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** (from Sysinternals) to monitor **file creation** and **network activity** related to SDXHelper.exe.\n   - Look for **unexpected network connections** or **unusual disk activity**.\n\n5. **Contact Microsoft or Google Support**:\n   - If the files are **legitimate**, they might be part of an **unusual update or configuration**. Contact **Microsoft Support** for Office-related issues or **Google Support** for SDXHelper.exe concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile **SDXHelper.exe** is generally a legitimate process, the **creation of JavaScript files in the Microsoft Office directory** is **unusual** and warrants further investigation. Verify the process's legitimacy, scan for malware, and check for recent software conflicts. If the behavior persists, consider contacting Microsoft or Google for deeper analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this data. So, there are multiple entries here, all with the same process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" and the same task \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The file paths are similar but have different hashes at the end. Wait, some of the hashes are repeated. For example, \"min_90b26cdd531166e95e440a3f8250de19.js\" appears twice, and \"min_9c72510375a8b6772d8b0e4fca32e6a2.js\" also appears twice. The others are unique.\n\nHmm, first thought: these are all JavaScript files being created by the SDXHelper process. The fact that they're being created might be normal, but the repetition of some hashes could be a red flag. Maybe it's a benign process, but I need to check what SDXHelper.exe is. I recall that SDXHelper is associated with some software, maybe a game or a media player? Wait, but I should verify that. Alternatively, it could be malware. Malware often creates multiple files with similar names to avoid detection or to store data.\n\nAnother thing to note is the directory structure. All the files are in \"PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\" under the user's AppData. That's a common location for some applications to store temporary or cached files. However, if this is a legitimate application, it might be expected to create such files. But the repetition of the same files could indicate that the process is trying to recreate them, which might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the hashes are unique, which could be part of a legitimate update or download process. But if the same file is being created multiple times, maybe there's an error in the process, or it's trying to overwrite or replace files. However, without knowing the context of the application, it's hard to say. \n\nI should also consider the possibility that this is a false positive. Maybe the SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate component of a software, and the creation of these files is part of its normal operation. But the repetition of the same files might be a sign of something else. For example, if the system is trying to download the same file multiple times due to a network issue, but that's less likely with a hash-based naming.\n\nAnother angle: the file names all end with \".js\", which are JavaScript files. If this is related to a web application or a game, they might be using these files for some scripting purposes. But again, without knowing the specific application, it's hard to confirm.\n\nI should check if there are any known issues with SDXHelper.exe. Maybe a quick search would show if it's associated with any malware. However, since I can't perform a search right now, I have to rely on known information. SDXHelper.exe is sometimes associated with the Steam client, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be part of a different application.\n\nIn summary, the repetition of the same file hashes might be normal if the application is creating multiple copies for some reason, but it could also be a sign of malicious activity. The key factors here are the context of the application and the behavior of the process. Without more information, it's a bit tricky, but the repeated creation of the same files could be a point of concern.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided data indicates that the **SDXHelper.exe** process is creating multiple **JavaScript files** (`.js`) in the directory `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`. Here's a structured analysis of the observations and potential implications:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Repetition of File Hashes**:\n   - Some files (e.g., `min_90b26cdd531166e95e440a3f8250de19.js`, `min_9c72510375a8b6772d8b0e4fca32e6a2.js`) are created **multiple times**.\n   - This could indicate:\n     - **Normal behavior** (e.g., caching, redundancy for reliability).\n     - **Abnormal behavior** (e.g., malware attempting to overwrite files or hide malicious content).\n\n2. **File Naming Pattern**:\n   - All files follow a pattern: `min_<hash>.js`, suggesting they might be **minified JavaScript** files (common in web applications).\n   - The use of unique hashes implies these files are likely part of a **dynamic or versioned update process**.\n\n3. **Process and Directory Context**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is often associated with **Microsoft Office** or **Windows system processes**, though it can also be part of third-party applications.\n   - The `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\` directory is typically used for **offline storage** of resources (e.g., Office add-ins, templates, or cached data).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Explanations**\n#### **Legitimate Behavior**\n- **Software Updates**: The process might be downloading or caching JavaScript resources for an application (e.g., Office, a game, or a media player).\n- **Redundancy**: Creating duplicates could be a safeguard against file corruption or a temporary measure during installation.\n- **Offline Mode**: Files in `OfflineFiles\\` might be prepared for use when the system is disconnected from the internet.\n\n#### **Suspicious Behavior**\n- **Malware Activity**: Repeated creation of identical files could be a tactic to **obfuscate malicious payloads** or **persist on the system**.\n- **Resource Abuse**: If the process is generating excessive files, it might be **consuming disk space** or **impacting system performance**.\n- **Unusual Hashes**: If the hashes do not match known legitimate files, it could indicate **tampering** or **unauthorized content**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify the Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Check the **file location** of `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\` for Microsoft Office).\n   - Use tools like **Malwarebytes**, **Windows Defender**, or **Process Explorer** to scan for malware.\n\n2. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Use **Task Manager** or **Resource Monitor** to observe CPU, memory, and disk usage by `SDXHelper.exe`.\n   - Look for unusual network activity (e.g., unexpected data transfers).\n\n3. **Check for User Reports**:\n   - Search online for `SDXHelper.exe` and the observed file hashes to see if they are associated with known malware or legitimate software.\n\n4. **System Cleanup**:\n   - If the files are not needed, consider **deleting them** (after ensuring they are not part of a critical application).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the behavior could be **benign** (e.g., part of a legitimate application's update process), the **repetition of identical files** and the use of a **non-standard directory** warrant further investigation. If the process is untrusted or associated with suspicious activity, it is advisable to **quarantine or remove it**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they indicate any suspicious activity.

If they're all clustered, that might be normal, but if they're spread over a long period, that could be suspicious. However, the user hasn't provided timestamps, so I can't do that. Maybe the repetition of certain filenames is a clue.\n\nLooking at the filenames, there are multiple entries with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min...\" and some with \"word-copilot.min...\". The repetition of the same filename, like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_d4e700e1156c67b27923e16490b7d460.js\" appearing twice, might be a red flag. Why would the same file be created twice? That could be an error, or maybe a malicious attempt to overwrite or inject code.\n\nAlso, the presence of \"min\" in the filenames suggests they are minified JavaScript files, which is common for web applications. However, if these are being created in the local file system by an Office process, that might be unusual. Normally, Office applications might not generate minified JS files locally unless they're part of an add-in or some extension.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\". I should check if this is a legitimate process. If I recall, Microsoft Office doesn't have a process named SDXHelper.exe. It might be a typo or a different process. Alternatively, it could be a legitimate helper process, but I need to verify. If it's not a known legitimate process, that's a concern.\n\nThe directory path is \"C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\Solution Packages\\...\". This seems like a standard location for Office add-ins or solutions. However, the presence of multiple JavaScript files being created here might be normal if it's part of an add-in deployment. But again, the repetition and the specific filenames could be suspicious.\n\nI should also look for any anomalies in the file names. The hashes in the filenames (like \"d4e700e1156c67b27923e16490b7d460\") could be checksums or unique identifiers. If they're all different, that's normal. But if they're similar or repeated, that might indicate something's wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that there are two entries for the same file might suggest an attempt to overwrite or inject code. If the same file is created twice, maybe the second time is a malicious payload.\n\nAnother angle: are these files being created by a legitimate Office process? If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but the files are not part of any known Office add-in, that could be a problem. Alternatively, if SDXHelper.exe is not a legitimate process, that's a clear sign of malware.\n\nSince I don't have information on whether SDXHelper.exe is legitimate, I should consider that as a point of concern. Also, the large number of files being created (over 15 entries) might be normal if it's part of a large add-in, but the repetition of the same file name is suspicious.\n\nIn conclusion, the suspicious aspects here are the repetition of the same file name, the presence of minified JavaScript files in an Office Solution Packages directory, and the process name SDXHelper.exe which might not be legitimate. These could indicate either a benign but unusual activity or a potential security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate the creation of multiple JavaScript files by the process **SDXHelper.exe** in the **Microsoft Office Solution Packages** directory. Here's a structured analysis of potential suspicious activity:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations and Concerns**\n1. **Repetition of File Names**:\n   - Certain files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_d4e700e1156c67b27923e16490b7d460.js`) are created **twice**. This could indicate:\n     - **Malicious overwriting** of files (e.g., injecting code).\n     - **Errors** in the process generating duplicate files.\n     - **Unintended behavior** if the same file is being repeatedly generated.\n\n2. **Unusual File Types in Office Directories**:\n   - **Minified JavaScript files** (e.g., `.min.js`) are typically associated with **web applications**, not local Office processes. While Office can use JavaScript for add-ins, the presence of **numerous minified JS files** in the `Solution Packages` directory raises concerns about:\n     - **Malicious add-ins** or **unauthorized code execution**.\n     - **Unusual deployment** of external scripts.\n\n3. **Process Name \"SDXHelper.exe\"**:\n   - **Legitimacy Check**: This process is **not a known Microsoft Office component**. Valid Office processes include `OUTLOOK.EXE`, `WINWORD.EXE`, or `EXCEL.EXE`.\n   - **Suspicion**: If \"SDXHelper.exe\" is not a recognized legitimate process, it could be **malware** or a **rogue helper tool**.\n\n4. **Volume of Files**:\n   - **15+ files** created in a short timeframe might be normal for a large add-in, but combined with other anomalies (e.g., duplicates), it could indicate **unauthorized activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Malware Infiltration**: The process might be **downloading or generating malicious code** (e.g., scripts for phishing, data exfiltration).\n- **Add-in Tampering**: If the files are part of an **Office add-in**, they could be **compromised** (e.g., embedded malware or backdoors).\n- **Process Spoofing**: The name \"SDXHelper.exe\" might be **spoofed** to mimic a legitimate helper process.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (via properties or tools like **Process Explorer**).\n   - Search for \"SDXHelper.exe\" in Microsoft's official documentation or threat databases (e.g., VirusTotal).\n\n2. **Inspect Files**:\n   - Analyze the contents of the generated `.min.js` files (e.g., via a hex editor or JavaScript de-minifier) for **malicious code** (e.g., obfuscated scripts, API calls to suspicious domains).\n\n3. **Check for Add-in Compromise**:\n   - Review **Office add-ins** (via `File > Options > Trust Center > Trusted Add-ins`) for unauthorized or untrusted sources.\n\n4. **Network Monitoring**:\n   - Monitor network traffic from `SDXHelper.exe` for **unusual outbound connections** (e.g., to C2 servers, data exfiltration).\n\n5. **Malware Scan**:\n   - Run a full system scan using updated antivirus\/malware tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the files could be part of a legitimate Office add-in, the **repetition of file names**, **unusual file types**, and **unknown process name** strongly suggest **potential malicious activity**. Immediate investigation is recommended to confirm legitimacy or mitigate risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of JSON events, all related to file creations by SDXHelper.exe in specific paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. My job is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to check if these files are part of normal Office operations. The filenames include things like \"word-copilot.min_...\" and \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\", which might be related to Office add-ins or copilot features. However, the presence of multiple files with similar names in different package directories could indicate something unusual. \n\nSDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. Typically, Microsoft Office processes would be like EXCEL.EXE, WINWORD.EXE, etc. SDXHelper.exe might be a third-party tool or a component from a different application. If it's creating multiple JavaScript files in Office's directories, that might be suspicious. \n\nAlso, looking at the paths, they're in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. SolutionPackages are used by Office for add-ins, but the files being created here are JavaScript files, which are usually part of web content, not native Office add-ins. Native add-ins might use different file types or locations. \n\nAnother thing is the repetition of certain files. For example, \"word-copilot.min_2964af3c5a68dc6c600202a0762070c3.js\" appears twice. Duplicate file creations could be a red flag, possibly indicating an attempt to overwrite or inject malicious code. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there's a legitimate reason. Maybe the user is installing a new Office add-in that requires these files. But without more context, like user interaction or known good sources, it's hard to say. The fact that all events are from SDXHelper.exe and the specific file paths might be indicative of a malicious activity, such as a dropper or a component of malware trying to establish a presence. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit moderate. There are enough suspicious elements to warrant further investigation, but without more data (like process parent, user context, or network activity), it's not definitive. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.65.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files with suspicious JavaScript names (e.g., 'word-copilot.min_...', 'officeaicopilot-strings.min_...') are created by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory. This process and file pattern are unusual for standard Office operations and may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
