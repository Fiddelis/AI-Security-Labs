The first thing I notice is that there's a process called cmd.exe running with a command line that uses certutil to encode and decode files. Specifically, it's taking calc.exe and encoding it into a temporary file, then decoding it again. That seems suspicious because certutil is often used for encoding\/decoding files, but when combined with processes like cmd.exe and the use of temporary files, it might be part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for certutil.exe creating files in the Temp directory. The file paths mention things like \"componente_base_calc.txt\" and \"registro_geral_calc_decoded.exe\". The use of temporary files and the decoding process could indicate that an executable is being generated, which might be malicious. Also, the presence of multiple registry value set events might suggest that the malware is trying to persist or modify system settings.\n\nAnother point is the involvement of rundll32.exe with PcaSvc.dll. That's a legitimate DLL, but if it's being used in an unusual way, it could be a red flag. However, the SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll seems normal, but I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity related to that.\n\nLooking at the chrome.exe events, they're mostly network connections and registry changes. While registry changes can be benign, the repetition might not be significant on its own. The winlogbeat.exe events are about file creation, which could be part of a log collection tool, but if there are other suspicious activities, that might be a red herring.\n\nPutting this all together, the key suspicious elements are the use of certutil to encode\/decode files, the creation of temporary executables, and the multiple registry modifications. These activities are often associated with malware attempting to execute payloads or persist on the system. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events points towards potential malicious behavior. However, without more context or additional indicators, it's not 100% certain. So, I'd classify this as interesting with a confidence around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil used for file encoding\/decoding, temporary file creation in AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp, and registry modifications.
