The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I should look through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's not unusual, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the commands. There's a command line that includes \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" with a log path pointing to $env:TEMP\\key.log. The name \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" sounds like it could be related to keylogging, which is definitely malicious. \n\nThen there are multiple entries where PowerShell creates files in temporary directories, like the one in AppData\\Local\\Temp. Creating files in temp folders can be normal, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might indicate something's wrong. Also, there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. Not sure if that's bad, but the name is in Portuguese, maybe \"objeto_temporario\" means temporary object. Not sure if that's a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is the registry events. Chrome.exe is setting registry values multiple times. That might be normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe not. However, the main concern here seems to be the PowerShell scripts. The fact that the same script is being called from different paths (like C:\\tarefa_base, C:\\elemento_secundario, etc.) might indicate that the attacker is trying to obfuscate the path. Also, the script's name is consistent, which could be a sign of a malicious script being executed multiple times.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is deleted immediately after creation, which might be an attempt to cover tracks. The file was created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory and then deleted. That's suspicious because why create a file just to delete it? Maybe it's a temporary file, but in combination with the keylogging script, it's more concerning.\n\nThe image loaded events include some legitimate DLLs like clr.dll, MpOAV.dll, and urlmon.dll. Those are part of .NET and Windows Defender, so that's probably normal. But the fact that PowerShell is loading those might not be an issue unless there's something else.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script being executed multiple times from different paths, along with file creation and deletion in temp directories, suggests that this could be a malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these factors makes me think this is worth investigating. The confidence is high because the keylogging script is a clear indicator of potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events involve executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in temporary directories, suggesting potential keylogging activity. File creation\/deletion in temp folders and repeated execution of suspicious scripts from obfuscated paths indicate possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user gave me a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The answer should be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification and confidence level.\n\nLooking at the first event: there's a PowerShell command that's running a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is logging keystrokes to a temporary file. The path mentioned is C:\\tarefa_base\\entrada_ativo\\entrada_temporario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That seems suspicious because keystroke logging is often associated with malware or keyloggers. The command line uses the $env:TEMP variable, which is a common tactic to hide files in temporary directories.\n\nThe second event mentions a file created at C:\\elemento_comum\\registro_principal\\elemento_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. Wait, that's the same script name as the first event. But the path here is different. However, the fact that the same script name appears in two different locations might be a red flag. Also, the winlog task here is \"Execute a Remote Command,\" which could indicate that the script was executed remotely, which is another suspicious activity.\n\nThe third event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so this might be normal. The file path is in the Downloads directory, which isn't unusual for a user to have a new config file. This seems less suspicious.\n\nThe fourth event is PowerShell creating a file called pacote_temporario.txt. Again, PowerShell is a common tool, and creating a text file isn't inherently malicious. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, the file name is in Portuguese, which might be a red herring or just a normal file name.\n\nThe fifth event is svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization directory. Svchost.exe is a standard Windows process, and the file created here seems related to system optimization. This is likely a legitimate activity, so not suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the first two events involve the same script name, Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is used for logging keystrokes. The first event runs it via PowerShell with a temporary log path, and the second event mentions the script being created in another location. Even though the second event's file path is different, the combination of the script name and the remote execution might indicate an attempt to install a keylogger. The other events don't show any signs of malicious activity. \n\nHowever, I should check if Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is a legitimate script. If it's part of a legitimate software, then maybe it's not malicious. But the name \"Get-Keystrokes\" is commonly associated with keylogging, which is often used in attacks. The fact that the script is being executed via PowerShell and written to a temporary directory suggests it's trying to avoid detection. \n\nAlso, the presence of two different file paths for the same script might indicate that the attacker is trying to move the script around or that it's part of a larger attack. The remote command execution task in the second event adds to the suspicion. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the batch of events does show signs of potential malicious activity, specifically related to keylogging. Therefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.75. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation, but not enough to be 100% certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involve the execution of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1', a script commonly associated with keylogging, and suspicious file creation activities. The combination of PowerShell execution, temporary file logging, and remote command execution tasks raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
