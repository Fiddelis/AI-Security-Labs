{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events here are about files being created or images loaded. The processes involved are SDXHelper.exe, svchost.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. The file paths for the created files are mostly in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which might be normal if it's part of some Office add-in or update. However, there are several entries where SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple JavaScript files with similar names but different hashes. That repetition might be a red flag. \n\nWait, looking closer, some of the file names are the same, like officeaicopilot-strings.min_0ba...js appearing twice. Maybe that's just a coincidence, but repeated file creation could indicate something. Also, the process SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. If it's part of a software like Sophos (SDX stands for Sophos Data Exchange), then it might be normal. But if it's not, that's a problem.\n\nAnother thing is the Security Group Management event with process null. That might be a failed logon attempt or a security event that's not tied to a specific process. It could be a false positive, but it's worth noting.\n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal if it's being set up. But the .new extension suggests it's a temporary file, which is typical during configuration changes. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe, some repeated filenames, and a security event. If SDXHelper is legitimate, maybe it's just part of normal operations. But if that process is malicious, then the repeated file creation could be part of data exfiltration or something else. However, without more context on the process's legitimacy, it's hard to say. The presence of a security event also adds some uncertainty. \n\nI think the key points here are the repeated file creations by SDXHelper and the security group management event. These might not be malicious on their own, but they could indicate something worth investigating further. So, the answer is probably that it's interesting and needs more analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries include several events that warrant further investigation, though no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity Highlights**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Frequency:** `SDXHelper.exe` is observed creating multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_*.js`) in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. Some filenames are repeated (e.g., `min_0ba...js`, `min_2c2...js`), which could indicate either benign operations (e.g., updates) or potential data exfiltration.\n   - **Process Context:** `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Windows process. If this is a legitimate tool (e.g., part of Sophos or another software), the activity may be normal. However, if the process is untrusted or uninstalled, this could signal malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Security Group Management Event:**\n   - An event with the task **\"Security Group Management\"** is logged without a process or file context. This could indicate a failed authentication attempt, group policy change, or other security-related activity. Further analysis of associated logs (e.g., event IDs, user accounts) is needed to determine its significance.\n\n3. **`winlogbeat.exe` File Creation:**\n   - A temporary configuration file (`.yml.new`) is created in the `Downloads` directory. While this is typical during log shipper setup, the absence of other related logs (e.g., configuration changes, user activity) could hint at an incomplete or unauthorized setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Analysis**\n- **Validate `SDXHelper.exe`:** Check if the process is associated with legitimate software (e.g., Sophos, Office add-ins) and ensure it is signed by a trusted publisher.\n- **Correlate Security Events:** Investigate the **\"Security Group Management\"** event for context (e.g., user accounts, IP addresses, event IDs).\n- **Monitor `SDXHelper.exe` Behavior:** Use tools like Process Monitor or network analysis to confirm if the created files are benign or if the process communicates with external servers.\n- **Review Winlogbeat Configuration:** Ensure the `.yml.new` file is part of a legitimate configuration change and not a precursor to a malicious action.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs contain **indicators of potential interest**, particularly the repetitive file creation by `SDXHelper.exe` and the ambiguous security event. While these could be benign, they warrant further investigation to rule out malicious activity. **This batch is worth investigating further.** \n\n**Classification:** **Interesting (Needs Further Analysis)**."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. Now, SDXHelper.exe – I'm not too familiar with that process. Maybe it's a legitimate part of some software, but I should check if it's known. Wait, maybe it's related to Microsoft Office? Not sure. But the fact that it's creating so many JS files in the SolutionPackages folder might be normal if it's part of some update or installation process. However, the sheer number of files being created could be a red flag. Like, why so many different JS files? Maybe they're part of a legitimate update, but sometimes malware does that too.\n\nThen there's the chrome.exe process setting registry values. That's a normal activity for Chrome, but if there are multiple registry changes, maybe something's wrong. However, in the logs, it's only two instances of chrome.exe doing that, so maybe that's just normal operation.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. That's a legitimate location for some Office-related files, but again, the creation of multiple JS files might be unusual. Also, the naming of the files – they all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min...\" which makes me think of something related to AI or copilot features in Office. Maybe that's part of a new feature, but I don't know if that's standard.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the task is to determine if the logs are interesting for investigation. So, I need to check for signs of compromise. If SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of files in a legitimate directory, but the files themselves are not standard, that could be suspicious. However, without knowing what SDXHelper.exe is, it's hard to tell. If this is a known legitimate process, then maybe it's okay. But if it's not, then it might be malware.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the repetition of the same files being created. For example, some entries have the same file path being created multiple times. That might be normal if the process is writing the same file multiple times, but again, it's hard to tell without more context.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are registry changes by chrome.exe could be normal, but if there's a lot of them, that might be an issue. However, in the logs, it's only two instances, so probably not a big deal.\n\nI should also check if the user has any information about SDXHelper.exe. If they don't, then it's a red flag. Since I don't have that info, I have to assume it's unknown. So, creating many files in a specific directory by an unknown process might be suspicious. Therefore, these logs could be interesting for investigation because they might indicate unauthorized activity or malware.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate activity that could be **interesting for investigation**, as they show potential signs of unusual behavior that may warrant further analysis. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **High Volume of File Creations by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Over 20+ JavaScript files** (`officeaicopilot-strings.min*.js`) are created in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`.\n   - The naming pattern (`officeaicopilot-strings.min...`) suggests these files might be related to **AI\/copilot features** (e.g., Microsoft 365 Copilot), but the **repetition and volume** of such files are unusual for standard software updates or legitimate processes.\n\n2. **Unusual Process Behavior:**\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is not a widely recognized or documented process in Microsoft's ecosystem. Its role is unclear, and its repeated file-creation activity in a legitimate Office directory raises **suspicion** (e.g., potential for **malware** or **unauthorized data collection**).\n\n3. **Registry Changes by `chrome.exe`:**\n   - While `chrome.exe` modifying registry values is **normal for Chrome**, the lack of context (e.g., what registry keys are modified) makes it **inconclusive**. However, this is **not inherently suspicious** and may be unrelated.\n\n### Why This Matters:\n- **`SDXHelper.exe`** could be a **legitimate helper tool** (e.g., for Office updates or AI features), but its **unknown origin** and **aggressive file-creation behavior** warrant investigation.\n- The **JavaScript files** might be **malicious payloads** (e.g., scripts for data exfiltration, persistence, or lateral movement) if they are not part of a known, signed software package.\n\n### Next Steps for Investigation:\n1. **Check the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Verify its **file signature** (digital certificate), **hash** (e.g., SHA-256), and **origin** (e.g., is it part of a known Microsoft product?).\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **VirusTotal** to analyze the file.\n\n2. **Analyze the JavaScript files:**\n   - Inspect the content of the `.js` files for **malicious code** (e.g., obfuscation, network requests to suspicious domains, or exfiltration logic).\n\n3. **Monitor system behavior:**\n   - Check for **unusual network activity**, **registry changes**, or **process interactions** involving `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n4. **Cross-reference with threat intelligence:**\n   - Search for `SDXHelper.exe` in threat intelligence platforms (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX) to determine if it is associated with known malware.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs **require further investigation** due to the **unusual behavior of `SDXHelper.exe`** and the **unusual volume of JavaScript files** in a legitimate system directory. While not definitively malicious, this activity **could indicate a potential compromise** or **unauthorized software installation**."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in the Office installation directory. The files all have names starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a bunch of alphanumeric characters and a .js extension. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. I recall that some software uses helper processes for various tasks. But why is it creating so many JavaScript files in the Office directory? That seems unusual. Office typically doesn't need to generate JavaScript files in its own folders unless it's part of some add-in or update process.\n\nLooking at the file names, \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" might be related to localization or some kind of string resources. The \"min\" could stand for minified, which is common in JavaScript to reduce file size. But why so many of them? Maybe it's part of an update or a patch. However, the repetition of the same file names suggests that maybe there's a problem with the process, like it's trying to create the same files multiple times, which could indicate a loop or an error.\n\nAnother angle is checking if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. I know that some legitimate software might use such names, but it's also possible that this is malware. Malware often creates files in system directories to avoid detection. The fact that these files are in the Office directory, which is a trusted location, might be a red flag. Also, the use of JavaScript files in that context is not typical for Office, which usually deals with binary files or other formats.\n\nI should also consider the timestamps. If all these events are happening in a short period, that could indicate a rapid creation of files, which is suspicious. However, without timestamps, it's hard to tell. The repetition of the same files might indicate that the process is failing to create them the first time, so it's retrying, which could be a sign of a problem.\n\nAnother thought: maybe this is part of a legitimate software update. For example, if a software is updating its localization files, it might generate minified JavaScript files. But again, the repetition and the number of files seem high. It's more common to have a few such files rather than multiple duplicates.\n\nI should also check if there are any known issues with SDXHelper.exe. A quick search in my mind (since I can't browse the internet) tells me that SDXHelper.exe is associated with some adware or potentially unwanted programs. These types of programs often create numerous files and modify system settings.\n\nPutting this all together, the creation of multiple JavaScript files in the Office directory by SDXHelper.exe is suspicious. It could be part of a legitimate process, but given the context and the typical behavior of such files, it's more likely to be related to malware or an adware component. The repetition of the same files might indicate an error in the process, which could be a sign of malicious activity trying to overwrite or install files without proper checks.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that **SDXHelper.exe** is generating multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`) in the **Microsoft Office installation directory**. Here's the analysis and implications:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process Identity**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a standard Microsoft Office component. It is often associated with **adware** or **potentially unwanted programs (PUPs)**, which may hijack system processes to execute malicious activities.\n\n2. **File Behavior**:\n   - The files created (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`) are **minified JavaScript files**. While this is common in web development, generating such files in the **Office directory** is **unusual** and not typical for legitimate Office operations.\n   - **Repetition of the same files** (e.g., `7bbcea0e29cbd6a23375d3e16b983098.js` appearing twice) suggests **duplicate creation attempts**, possibly due to a **loop** or **error handling** in the process.\n\n3. **Location**:\n   - The files are being written to the **Office installation directory** (`C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\...`), which is a **trusted system location**. Malware often targets such directories to avoid detection, as they are less likely to be flagged by security software.\n\n4. **Potential Purpose**:\n   - The filenames suggest **localization\/translation resources** (e.g., `strings.min_...`), but the **volume and repetition** are inconsistent with legitimate software updates. This raises concerns about **malicious intent**, such as:\n     - **Injecting scripts** into Office applications.\n     - **Data exfiltration** via hidden JavaScript payloads.\n     - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., creating files to survive reboots).\n\n---\n\n### **Risks and Implications:**\n- **Malware Infection**: The behavior is highly suspicious and consistent with **adware** or **malware** attempting to **modify system files** or **embed malicious scripts**.\n- **System Stability**: Repeated file creation could indicate **resource exhaustion** or **corruption** of the Office installation.\n- **Data Security**: JavaScript files in system directories may be used to **execute malicious code** or **interact with external servers** (e.g., for phishing or data theft).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Use **antivirus software** (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes) to scan the system for **adware** or **malware**.\n   - Check for **unwanted programs** in **Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a program**.\n\n2. **Investigate SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Use **Process Explorer** or **Task Manager** to verify the **origin** of `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., file path, digital signature).\n   - If the file is not signed by Microsoft or a trusted developer, it should be **removed immediately**.\n\n3. **Check for Office Corruption**:\n   - Run **Office Repair** via:\n     - **Control Panel > Programs > Microsoft Office > Change > Repair**.\n   - Use **sfc \/scannow** and **DISM** to repair system files.\n\n4. **Monitor Network Activity**:\n   - Use tools like **Wireshark** or **Windows Firewall logs** to check if the files are communicating with **unauthorized servers**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe behavior described is **highly suspicious** and likely indicates **malware infection**. The repeated creation of JavaScript files in the Office directory by an unknown process (SDXHelper.exe) is not consistent with legitimate software behavior. Immediate action is recommended to **remove the threat** and **secure the system**."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office Package Resources directory. The files all have the same naming pattern: officeaicopilot-strings.min_ followed by a hash. Hmm, first thing I notice is that there are a lot of these files being created. Like, 16 entries here. But wait, some of them are duplicates. For example, the file min_a582bcf06a89d7ce6aa896e4f2c606f6.js appears twice, same with min_a97a3b3b45b83dda327cdb2b00b9f984.js. That's odd. Why would the same file be created multiple times?\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe... I'm not too familiar with that process. Let me think. Maybe it's related to some software installation or update? But creating so many files in the Office directory... Office usually doesn't generate a bunch of minified JavaScript files in its resources folder. Those files look like they could be part of a web application or an extension. Maybe a malicious payload?\n\nWait, the fact that the same files are created multiple times might indicate that there's an attempt to overwrite or maybe a failed installation. But why so many different hashes? Each hash is unique, so they're different files. But why so many? It's possible that this is part of a legitimate process, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a sign of malware trying to inject files into the system.\n\nAnother angle: the directory path is %AppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\PackageResources. That's a standard location for Office add-ins or customizations. If this is a legitimate add-in, the files might be part of its resources. However, the presence of so many files, especially with minified JS, might be suspicious. Legitimate add-ins usually don't generate dozens of such files. Also, the process name SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. If not, that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, the fact that the same file is created twice might be an error, or perhaps a loop in the installation process. If the process is trying to create the same file multiple times, that could indicate a problem. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn terms of threat indicators, the combination of unusual process name, multiple file creations in a non-standard directory, and the nature of the files (minified JS) could be indicative of a malicious activity. However, I can't confirm without more analysis, like checking the file contents, the process's origin, or looking for other related events in the logs.\n\nSo, considering all this, the logs might be part of a legitimate process, but the signs are more indicative of a potential threat. The answer should highlight the suspicious aspects and suggest further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate the creation of multiple JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the Office Package Resources directory by the process `SDXHelper.exe`. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious aspects and potential implications:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations and Concerns**\n1. **Unusual Process Name**:\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Microsoft process. Legitimate Office-related processes typically have names like `OUTLOOK.EXE`, `WINWORD.EXE`, or `ONENOTE.EXE`. The presence of an unfamiliar process raises a red flag.\n\n2. **Abnormal File Creation**:\n   - **Volume**: 16 files are created, many with unique hash-based names. While some files are duplicated (e.g., `min_a582bcf06a89d7ce6aa896e4f2c606f6.js`), the sheer number of files is unusual for a standard application.\n   - **File Type**: Minified JavaScript files (`*.min.js`) are often associated with web applications, extensions, or malicious payloads. Their presence in the Office directory is unexpected and potentially indicative of tampering.\n\n3. **Directory Context**:\n   - The files are created in `%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\PackageResources`, a location typically used for Office add-ins or customizations. However, the files do not appear to be standard Office resources, and their purpose is unclear.\n\n4. **Potential for Malicious Activity**:\n   - The repeated creation of files with unique hashes could suggest an attempt to inject or overwrite resources, possibly for persistence, data exfiltration, or other malicious purposes.\n   - The duplication of files (e.g., `min_a582bcf06a89d7ce6aa896e4f2c606f6.js` appearing twice) might indicate an error, failed installation, or a loop in the process.\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Explanations**\n- **Legitimate but Unusual**: If `SDXHelper.exe` is part of a legitimate third-party Office add-in or tool, the files could be part of its resources. However, this would be highly unusual and would require further validation (e.g., checking the publisher, digital signatures, or documentation).\n- **Malicious Activity**: The behavior aligns with tactics used by malware to inject payloads, evade detection, or establish persistence. The minified JavaScript files could be obfuscated code or part of a dropper.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Next Steps**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the file path and digital signature of `SDXHelper.exe`. Legitimate processes are typically signed by trusted publishers (e.g., Microsoft or known software vendors).\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to analyze the process.\n\n2. **Analyze File Contents**:\n   - Inspect the minified JavaScript files to check for malicious code (e.g., obfuscation, suspicious API calls, or exfiltration patterns).\n\n3. **Check for Additional Indicators**:\n   - Look for other suspicious activity in the logs (e.g., network connections, registry changes, or user behavior).\n   - Use a sandbox or static analysis tool to examine the files for malware.\n\n4. **Isolate and Remove Suspicious Files**:\n   - If the files are confirmed malicious, delete them and remove the associated process. Reinstall Office or the add-in from a trusted source.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs exhibit behavior consistent with **potential malicious activity**. While a legitimate explanation cannot be ruled out, the combination of an unusual process, abnormal file creation, and the nature of the files strongly suggests further investigation is warranted. Immediate action to isolate and analyze the files is recommended."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what's going on here. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash. The paths are all under the user's AppData Local Microsoft Office folder. Now, SDXHelper.exe isn't a process I recognize off the top of my head. Microsoft Office usually has its own processes, but maybe this is part of an add-in or some kind of package installer? However, creating so many files with similar names might be suspicious. It could be part of a legitimate update or installation, but it's also possible that this is malware generating a lot of files to hide its presence.\n\nThen there are entries related to chrome.exe. Chrome is loading DLLs from the Windows Defender Platform, which seems normal because Chrome often interacts with security software. The image load events for MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll are part of Microsoft Defender's real-time protection, so that's probably legitimate. The registry value set events for chrome.exe might be part of Chrome's normal operations, like updating settings or extensions. But I should check if there's anything unusual there. However, the user didn't provide the specific registry keys or values, so it's hard to tell. But since the other events related to chrome.exe seem to be standard, maybe they're not the issue.\n\nNow, looking back at the SDXHelper.exe events. The fact that it's creating so many files in the Office directory could be a red flag. Malware often creates files in temporary or user-specific directories to avoid detection. The repetitive nature of the filenames with different hashes might indicate that they're generated dynamically, which is common in malware. Also, the presence of multiple file creation events without any other processes involved might suggest that SDXHelper.exe is acting suspiciously. However, I should consider if there's a legitimate reason for this. For example, if someone is installing a new Office add-in or a language pack, it might create multiple files. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the user didn't mention any other processes or events that might be related. The chrome.exe events don't seem to be connected to the SDXHelper activities. The only other event is the registry changes from chrome.exe, which again, without more details, are hard to assess.\n\nSo, putting this together: the main concern is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a potentially sensitive directory. If this process is not known or expected on the system, it could be a sign of malicious activity. However, if SDXHelper.exe is part of a legitimate software that's being installed or updated, then it might be normal. Since the logs don't provide more context, the safest conclusion is that the SDXHelper.exe activity is suspicious and warrants further investigation. The chrome.exe events don't appear to be problematic based on the information given.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate **potential suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Concerns:**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` is creating **multiple JavaScript files** (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the **Office SolutionPackages directory** (`C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`).\n   - **Suspicious Patterns:**\n     - **Unusual Process Name:** `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Microsoft Office process. Legitimate Office processes typically include names like `OUTLOOK.EXE`, `WINWORD.EXE`, or `EXCEL.EXE`.\n     - **File Naming:** The filenames suggest dynamically generated content (e.g., `<hash>` in the name), which is common in malware for obfuscation or evasion.\n     - **Volume of Files:** Over **15+ files** created in a short timeframe in a directory typically used for Office add-ins or temporary installations.\n\n2. **Lack of Context for `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - No logs indicate that `SDXHelper.exe` is part of a legitimate installation or update. If this process is not registered in the system (e.g., no corresponding installer or documentation), it raises red flags.\n\n3. **Chrome-Related Activity (Less Suspicious):**\n   - **Image Load Events:** `chrome.exe` loading `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (part of **Windows Defender**) is **normal** and expected.\n   - **Registry Changes:** No malicious intent is evident from the limited data (e.g., no indication of keylogging or persistence mechanisms).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n  - Check if the process is signed by a trusted publisher (e.g., Microsoft).\n  - Verify its presence in the system (e.g., file location, digital signature, and parent process).\n  - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to analyze its behavior.\n- **Check for Malware:**\n  - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/antimalware tools.\n  - Monitor for unusual network activity or changes to the registry.\n- **Review Office Add-ins:**\n  - If Office is involved, check for recently installed add-ins or updates that might be associated with `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe **repetitive file creation by `SDXHelper.exe`** is highly suspicious and could indicate **malware activity**. The Chrome-related events do not appear malicious. Further analysis of `SDXHelper.exe` is critical to determine if this is a threat."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to analyze these log entries and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through each event.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with long, random-looking names. That seems odd. Why would SDXHelper.exe be creating so many JS files in that location? Maybe it's part of a legitimate Office update or package, but the frequency and the specific paths might be suspicious.\n\nThen there are entries from chrome.exe. Some of them are about creating files, like the Excel file with a Zone.Identifier, which is usually a marker for downloaded files. But there's also a file stream created for the same Excel file multiple times. That might be normal if the file is being processed, but the repetition could be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is the registry value set events from chrome.exe. Changing registry values can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if it's modifying settings that could help malware persist or hide.\n\nLooking at the EXCEL.EXE entries, they're loading several DLLs like mscoree.dll, amsi.dll, and others. Some of these are legitimate system components, but the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll might be normal. However, if there's any unusual behavior in how these are loaded, that could be a problem.\n\nThe last event is about user account management, but since the process is null, that might just be a system event and not relevant.\n\nPutting it all together: SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JS files in Office directories might be part of a malicious package, especially if those files are not part of a known legitimate update. The repeated file stream creations and registry changes by chrome.exe could indicate some form of tampering or data exfiltration. The EXCEL.EXE loading various DLLs might be normal, but combined with other suspicious activities, it raises concerns.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. Some of these could be legitimate. For example, Office might generate temporary files, and Chrome might create zone identifiers. But the combination of multiple unusual events, especially from SDXHelper.exe, which isn't a commonly known process, might warrant further investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because there's a possibility of false positives, but the presence of multiple suspicious events increases the likelihood of something being wrong.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries exhibit a mix of potentially legitimate and suspicious activities, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation**:\n   - **Frequency**: Multiple JavaScript files (`*.js`) are created in `Microsoft.Office.SolutionPackages` directories, with names containing random hexadecimal strings (e.g., `word_88b086261de1446381728f2f003dad876baa5ace5feab65b3fba352ef7fab4c6.js`).\n   - **Context**: While `SDXHelper.exe` is associated with Microsoft Office (e.g., managing add-ins), the volume and naming pattern of these files deviate from typical legitimate behavior. This could indicate a **malicious payload** or **tampered Office installation**.\n\n2. **Chrome.exe Anomalies**:\n   - **Zone.Identifier Files**: Creation of `~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx` (a temporary file marker for downloaded Excel files) and repeated `FileCreate` events for the same file may suggest **data manipulation** or **tampering**.\n   - **Registry Modifications**: Unspecified registry changes (`RegistryEvent`) by Chrome could hint at **configuration tampering** or **malware persistence**.\n\n3. **Excel.exe DLL Loading**:\n   - While loading system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `amsi.dll`) is normal for Excel, the inclusion of **Windows Defender's `MpOAV.dll**` (antivirus component) is not inherently suspicious. However, if these loads are **unusual in context** (e.g., during document processing), they may warrant scrutiny.\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **Zone.Identifier**: Normal for marking downloaded files.\n- **Excel DLL Loads**: Routine for Excel's operation, especially with .NET integration.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combination of **unusual file creation by SDXHelper.exe**, **repeated Chrome.exe activity**, and **potential registry tampering** raises **moderate concern**. While not definitively malicious, these events merit deeper analysis (e.g., file content inspection, network traffic monitoring, and checking for unauthorized Office add-ins). \n\n**Recommendation**: Flag for investigation due to the **cluster of atypical events** that could indicate **malware activity** or **compromised system components**.\n\n**Confidence Level**: **High** (due to multiple red flags), but **caution is advised** to avoid false positives."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: Excel.exe deleting a file named ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. The tilde and dollar sign in the filename suggest it's a temporary or backup file, maybe from Excel's auto-save feature. That's normal, but maybe not a red flag on its own.\n\nThen there are several entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process, so that's usually normal. However, multiple registry changes might be worth noting, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office, so creating files there might be part of normal operations. But there are two identical entries, which could be a duplication error or maybe a repeated action. Not sure yet.\n\nThen, Excel.exe is creating a file stream in a temporary directory, which seems normal for temporary files. The Zone.Identifier part might be related to marking files as downloaded from the internet, which is standard for security reasons.\n\nLoading coml2.dll and VBEUI.DLL by Excel.exe – those are legitimate system DLLs, so that's expected.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file is normal during setup. But the path is in Downloads, which might be less secure than a system directory, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at the repeated Registry value set events by Excel.exe. There are 11 of them. That's a lot. Excel usually doesn't modify the registry that much. Maybe it's part of some macro activity or add-in? If Excel is modifying multiple registry keys, that could be a sign of something unusual, especially if it's related to persistence or configuration changes.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple file creations by SDXHelper and Excel, but most of them seem to be in expected locations. However, the high number of registry changes by Excel is a bit concerning. Typically, Excel might modify the registry for things like add-ins or settings, but 11 times in a short period could indicate automated or malicious activity.\n\nAnother thing is the file deletion of the temporary Excel file. If that's part of normal operations, it's okay. But if it's trying to delete logs or other files, that could be a problem. However, the file path here is in the Downloads folder, which is common for user-generated files.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious part is the high number of registry modifications by Excel.exe. That's not typical and might indicate something like a macro running that's making changes. The other events seem to be part of normal operations. So this batch might be worth investigating further to check if the Excel process is behaving unusually, maybe due to a malicious macro or some other issue.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows a mix of normal system and application activities, but there are **indications of potential unusual behavior** that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Excel.exe and Registry Modifications**:\n   - **11 repeated \"Registry value set\" events** by `EXCEL.EXE` (e.g., `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\...`). \n   - **Why this is concerning**: Excel typically does not modify the registry extensively unless interacting with macros, add-ins, or external scripts. A high volume of registry changes in a short time could indicate:\n     - **Macro or script activity** (e.g., malicious macros modifying registry keys for persistence or configuration).\n     - **Unusual behavior** (e.g., tampering with Office settings or injecting hooks).\n\n2. **File Creation by SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Repeated file creation in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` (e.g., `fabric_...js` files).\n   - **Context**: SDXHelper is associated with Microsoft Office, and these files might be part of **add-in or template operations**. However, **duplicate entries** (same file paths in multiple logs) could suggest **redundant or forced operations** (e.g., a script repeatedly generating files).\n\n3. **File Deletion by Excel.exe**:\n   - Deletion of a temporary file (`~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) in the `Downloads` folder.\n   - **Normal behavior**: Excel often creates and deletes temporary files during document editing. However, **deletion of files in user directories** (especially if not explicitly initiated by the user) could be a red flag if part of a broader pattern (e.g., clearing logs or evidence).\n\n4. **Winlogbeat.exe Activity**:\n   - Creation of a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` folder.\n   - **Context**: Winlogbeat is a legitimate log-shipper tool. However, **config files in user directories** (vs. system or application-specific paths) might indicate **misconfiguration or unauthorized setup**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**:\n- **Malicious Macro Activity**: The repeated registry modifications by Excel could be linked to **malicious macros** (e.g., phishing documents with embedded scripts).\n- **Persistence Mechanisms**: Registry changes might be part of **persistence attempts** (e.g., modifying startup keys or injecting code).\n- **Unusual File Operations**: Repeated file creation\/deletion in non-standard locations (e.g., `Downloads`) could indicate **data exfiltration or evasion**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Check for Macro Activity**:\n   - Scan the affected Excel file (`Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) for macros or embedded scripts.\n   - Use tools like **Microsoft Defender ATP** or **VirusTotal** for analysis.\n\n2. **Investigate Registry Changes**:\n   - Correlate the registry keys modified by Excel with **known good baselines** (e.g., using **Sysinternals Process Monitor**).\n   - Look for **unusual keys** (e.g., `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\...` with unexpected values).\n\n3. **Monitor SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Check if `SDXHelper.exe` is running from **unexpected locations** (e.g., not part of the official Office installation).\n   - Use **endpoint detection tools** (e.g., **CrowdStrike**, **Carbon Black**) to flag suspicious behavior.\n\n4. **Review Winlogbeat Configuration**:\n   - Ensure the `.yml.new` file is part of a **legitimate configuration update** and not tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile many events are consistent with normal Office and system behavior, the **high volume of registry modifications by Excel.exe** and **repeated file operations** suggest **potential malicious activity** (e.g., macro exploitation). This batch **requires further investigation** to rule out threats like phishing, persistence, or data exfiltration."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events here are about Excel.EXE performing registry value sets. There are like nine entries where the process is EXCEL.EXE and the task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Then there are a few entries where the process is null and the task is \"None\". But the more interesting ones are the ones involving SDXHelper.exe.\n\nLooking at the SDXHelper.exe events, they're creating files in specific paths under the user's AppData directory. The files have names like office_2e97d65336bd5d3533e966e9de09077e.js and others. These files are being created multiple times, even with the same file paths repeated. Also, there's a DNS query event from EXCEL.EXE, which might be normal, but combined with the file creations, it could be suspicious.\n\nNow, why would this be interesting? Well, Excel.EXE is a legitimate process, but modifying the registry multiple times might indicate something. However, the main red flag here is the SDXHelper.exe creating a lot of JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That directory is typically used for add-ins or solutions, so creating multiple files there could be part of a malicious add-in or a data exfiltration attempt. The repetition of the same file paths might indicate that the process is trying to deploy or update something, but the presence of multiple files with different names could be a sign of malicious activity, especially if they're not part of a known legitimate add-in.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that there are multiple entries for the same files being created might suggest that there's an attempt to overwrite or install multiple components. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious. But since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, the combination of registry changes by Excel and unusual file creations by SDXHelper.exe would warrant further examination. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate software update or installation, but the unusual volume and the specific paths might be indicative of something more sinister. Therefore, it's worth flagging for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains activity that warrants further investigation due to the following indicators:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Unusual Volume of Registry Modifications by `EXCEL.EXE`:**\n   - **Nine** entries show `EXCEL.EXE` performing **\"Registry value set\"** operations. While Excel can legitimately modify the registry (e.g., for add-ins or configuration), repeated modifications without clear context may indicate tampering or unauthorized changes.\n\n2. **Suspicious File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Multiple** entries show `SDXHelper.exe` creating **JavaScript files** in the user's `AppData\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. This path is typically used for **Office add-ins** or **custom solutions**, but:\n     - The **repetition of file paths** (e.g., `transcription-strings.min_41d770caa4405d96cfefae03e2c3685f.js` created twice) suggests potential **redundant or forced deployment**.\n     - The **names of files** (e.g., `vendor_6885c85796bd643fd6bc6d7029ad257e.js`) resemble **obfuscated or minified code**, which is common in **malicious payloads** or **data exfiltration tools**.\n\n3. **Lack of Clear Legitimacy:**\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is not a standard Microsoft process. While it could be part of a **third-party add-in**, the absence of documentation or context for these files raises concerns.\n   - The **DNS query** by `EXCEL.EXE` (if tied to the same user\/session) could indicate **network communication** with external servers, potentially for **data exfiltration** or **C2 (command-and-control)** activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This is Interesting for Investigation:**\n- **Potential Malicious Add-In:** The file creation pattern resembles behavior seen in **malicious Office add-ins** that inject code or steal data.\n- **Unusual Behavior:** The combination of **registry modifications** (by a legitimate process) and **unexplained file creation** (by an obscure process) could indicate **tampering** or **exploitation**.\n- **Lack of Context:** No clear justification for the volume of registry changes or the purpose of the JavaScript files is provided in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n1. **Check File Contents:** Analyze the created JavaScript files for **malicious code** (e.g., obfuscation, API calls to external domains).\n2. **Verify `SDXHelper.exe`:** Confirm if this is a legitimate process (e.g., via digital signatures, vendor information) or if it’s associated with known malware.\n3. **Correlate with Network Traffic:** Investigate the **DNS query** from `EXCEL.EXE` to identify communication with suspicious domains.\n4. **Review User Activity:** Determine if the user has installed **unauthorized software** or if this activity aligns with **phishing** or **social engineering** attempts.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis activity is **suspicious enough to warrant investigation**. While not definitively malicious, the combination of **unusual registry changes**, **unexplained file creation**, and **lack of context** suggests the possibility of **malware** or **compromise**. Further analysis of the files and network behavior is critical."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and some hashes, like da-dk-ui-strings-json_fa00... etc.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in handling add-ins or solutions. The files being created are in the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles folder, which sounds like they might be part of an Office add-in or template. The presence of multiple files with different language codes suggests that these could be localized resources for an add-in.\n\nBut wait, why so many files? Each entry is a separate file creation. However, looking at the paths, some entries have the same package ID, like 36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b, which might be a specific add-in. The repetition of the same file name (like eu-es-ui-strings-json_a2e18453e21d34b5fedf0f74fed2ebd7.js appearing twice) could be a red flag. Maybe it's a duplicate or an error in the logging?\n\nHowever, if this is part of a legitimate Office add-in deployment, then creating multiple resource files in the SolutionPackages directory could be normal. The key is whether these files are expected. If the user hasn't installed any new add-ins recently, this might be suspicious. Alternatively, if they're in the process of developing or deploying an add-in, this could be part of the normal operation.\n\nAnother angle: the use of SDXHelper.exe. If this process is creating files in the Office directory, but the user isn't aware of any such activity, it could indicate a potential security issue. However, without more context, like other suspicious processes or unexpected behavior, it's hard to say.\n\nThe hashes in the filenames are probably unique identifiers for each resource. If these are part of a legitimate add-in, they would have specific hashes. But if they're generated by malware, the hashes might be random or part of a larger malicious payload. However, the filenames suggest they are UI strings, which are more likely to be part of a legitimate application's resources.\n\nIn summary, while the activity could be normal for an Office add-in deployment, the lack of context makes it a bit ambiguous. The repetition of certain files and the sheer number might be worth investigating further, but without additional signs of compromise, it's not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the `SDXHelper.exe` process (associated with Microsoft Office) is creating multiple `.js` files in the `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` directory under the user's Office installation path. These files are named with language codes (e.g., `da-dk`, `fr-ca`) and unique hashes (e.g., `fa00...`, `a2e18453...`). Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Context**:\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is a known Microsoft Office process involved in managing add-ins, solutions, or localized resources.\n   - The `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` directory is typically used to store localized or offline resources for Office add-ins or templates.\n   - The filenames (e.g., `xx-yy-ui-strings-json_...`) suggest they are **localized UI string files** for an Office add-in or solution, which aligns with normal Office behavior.\n\n2. **Potential Red Flags**:\n   - **Repetition of Files**: Some files (e.g., `eu-es-ui-strings-json_a2e18453e21d34b5fedf0f74fed2ebd7.js`) appear twice, which could indicate logging duplication or a minor anomaly.\n   - **High Volume**: The sheer number of files (15+ entries) might be unusual unless the user is actively deploying a large-scale add-in with many localized resources.\n\n3. **Malicious Possibility**:\n   - If **no corresponding Office add-in** is installed or being developed, these files could indicate **unauthorized activity** (e.g., malware伪装 as legitimate Office processes).\n   - The use of unique hashes in filenames might be a tactic to evade detection, though this is speculative without further context.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Check for Office Add-ins**: Verify if the user has recently installed or updated an Office add-in that requires localized resources. If not, investigate further.\n- **Monitor for Unusual Behavior**: Look for other suspicious processes, unexpected network activity, or changes to the Office installation directory.\n- **File Analysis**: Examine the contents of the generated `.js` files (if accessible) to confirm they are legitimate UI strings or if they contain obfuscated code.\n- **Security Scans**: Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/malware tools to rule out malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the activity **could be legitimate** (e.g., deploying an Office add-in with localized resources), the **high volume of files** and **repetition** warrant further investigation. If no corresponding add-in exists, this may indicate **malicious behavior**. Context (e.g., user activity, recent software changes) is critical to determining the true nature of these files."}

The files are in paths related to Microsoft Office SolutionPackages, specifically under PackageResources\/OfflineFiles. The filenames look like they're UI strings in various languages, like gu-in, hr-hr, hu-hu, etc. There's also a fabric.js and some icon files. These might be part of a normal Office installation or update, but I should check if there's anything suspicious.\n\nThen there's an entry where EXCEL.EXE is setting a registry value, and several svchost.exe entries related to registry events. Registry changes can be normal, but combined with other activities, they might indicate something. However, svchost is a common system process, so unless there's something unusual in the registry keys, it might not be a problem.\n\nWait, but looking at the SDXHelper.exe activity again. SDXHelper is associated with Microsoft Office, so creating these UI string files could be part of a legitimate process. However, the repetition of certain files being created multiple times (like id-id-ui-strings-json appearing twice) might be normal if they're part of a package installation. But maybe not. Also, there's a fabric.js file which could be part of a legitimate Office resource, but I should check if that's typical.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there are some entries with process null and task None. Those might be incomplete logs or errors, but they don't seem to indicate malicious activity directly.\n\nNow, considering the registry events. EXCEL.EXE and svchost.exe making changes to the registry. If these changes are to keys that are not commonly modified, that could be a red flag. But without knowing the specific registry paths, it's hard to say. However, the presence of multiple registry events might be part of a normal operation, like an update or configuration change.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of the events are related to SDXHelper.exe creating files that seem to be part of Office resources. These could be legitimate if the system is installing or updating Office. However, if this is happening on a system where Office wasn't recently updated, or if there are other signs of compromise, it might be worth investigating further. The registry events by svchost and EXCEL are normal in many cases, but without more context, it's hard to be certain. \n\nBut since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, I should consider if there's any pattern that's suspicious. The fact that SDXHelper is creating so many files in the SolutionPackages directory might be normal, but if there's an unusual number of files or if they're in unexpected locations, that could be a problem. However, given the information here, it's not clearly malicious. The answer would probably be that it's not necessarily suspicious, but if there's a context where Office isn't expected to be installing updates, it might warrant further look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs provided appears to be **primarily related to legitimate system and application activities**, though a few points warrant closer scrutiny. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. SDXHelper.exe File Creation Events**\n- **Activity**: Multiple entries show `SDXHelper.exe` creating files in the `Microsoft Office SolutionPackages\/PackageResources\/OfflineFiles` directory. These files are named with language-specific UI strings (e.g., `gu-in-ui-strings-json`, `id-id-ui-strings-json`) and include files like `fabric.js` and icon resources.\n- **Likely Explanation**: \n  - **Legitimate**: These files are consistent with **Microsoft Office localization resources** or **update packages**. `SDXHelper.exe` is a known Office component involved in installing or configuring Office add-ins or language packs.\n  - **Red Flags**: \n    - Repeated creation of the same file (e.g., `id-id-ui-strings-json` appears twice). This could indicate **redundant operations** or **potential tampering** if the files are being overwritten or duplicated unnecessarily.\n    - The absence of clear user-initiated actions (e.g., an Office update or installation) might raise questions if this occurs in a system with no recent Office activity.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Registry Events**\n- **Activity**: \n  - `EXCEL.EXE` and `svchost.exe` trigger registry events (`Registry value set` or `Registry object added\/deleted`).\n- **Likely Explanation**: \n  - **Normal**: `svchost.exe` is a standard Windows process that hosts various system services. Registry changes by `EXCEL.EXE` could relate to **configuration updates** or **plugin management**.\n  - **Red Flags**: \n    - The lack of specificity in the registry keys (no paths provided) makes it difficult to assess whether these changes are benign or malicious. If these events are **unusual for the system's context** (e.g., no recent Excel updates or known service changes), they might warrant further investigation.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Incomplete\/Null Entries**\n- **Activity**: Two entries have `process: null` and `winlog: {\"task\": \"None\"}`.\n- **Likely Explanation**: These could be **log parsing errors** or **incomplete event captures**. While not inherently suspicious, they may indicate **system instability** or **log integrity issues**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Not Clearly Suspicious, but Context-Dependent**\n- **No direct signs of malware**: The activity aligns with **legitimate Office operations** and **standard system processes**.\n- **Potential for further investigation**:\n  - If the system has **no recent Office updates** or **unauthorized installations**, the repeated file creation by `SDXHelper.exe` could be anomalous.\n  - The registry events should be cross-referenced with known **system baselines** or **recent changes** to confirm legitimacy.\n\n**Recommendation**: Monitor for **unauthorized Office installations**, check for **unexpected language pack installations**, and review **registry changes** in the context of recent system activity. If this occurs in a **secure environment** with no known updates, a deeper forensic analysis may be warranted."}
