First, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of Image loaded events for SDXHelper.exe. It's loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Wait, those are legitimate system DLLs, so that might not be a problem. But why is SDXHelper.exe doing that? Maybe it's normal, but I should check if there are any other oddities.\n\nThen there's rundll32.exe executing a command with shell32.dll and a GUID. That seems a bit unusual. The command line includes -Embedding, which is sometimes used in malicious contexts. But I need to see if that's part of normal operations or something suspicious.\n\nThere's also winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a log file, maybe part of normal monitoring. Not too concerning.\n\nEXCEL.EXE is loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are related to antivirus and security features. Maybe Excel is doing some legitimate checks, but it's possible that malware could be using these to bypass detection. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe WmiPrvSE.exe process is involved, which is part of Windows Management Instrumentation. The image loaded event points to wmiutils.dll, which is a legitimate file. But again, depends on the context.\n\nThere are some User Account Management events, but they don't have process or file details. Maybe just normal user activity.\n\nRegistry value set events from svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. Those are common system processes, so unless there's a specific change, they might not be an issue.\n\nThe main thing I notice is the repeated Image loaded events from SDXHelper.exe. If that's a legitimate application, it's normal. But if SDXHelper.exe is a suspicious or unknown process, that could be a red flag. However, the user hasn't provided information on whether SDXHelper.exe is known or not. Given that the DLLs being loaded are system ones, maybe it's not a problem. The rundll32.exe command line with the GUID might be something to look into, but without more info, it's hard to tell. \n\nOverall, there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The events seem to be part of normal system operations. So I might classify this as NOT INTERESTING. But I should check again for any anomalies. The confidence is medium, maybe 0.5, since there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but some events could be worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily reflect normal system operations (e.g., legitimate DLLs loaded by SDXHelper.exe, Excel process activity, and standard Windows services). No clear indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior are present across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The majority of them are related to User Account Management under winlog's task. But then there are a few events involving EXCEL.EXE. Let me check each one.\n\nFirst, there's an event where EXCEL.EXE loads an image from coml2.dll. Wait, coml2.dll is a legitimate Windows system file, but loading it from System32 might be normal. However, sometimes attackers might use legitimate processes to load malicious DLLs. But in this case, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\coml2.dll, which is the correct location. So maybe that's just a normal process.\n\nThen there are multiple DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE. DNS queries themselves aren't necessarily bad, but if they're going to suspicious domains, that's a red flag. However, the event data here doesn't mention the domain or IP address, so I can't tell if they're malicious. But repeated DNS queries could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nNext, there are two file creation events where EXCEL.EXE creates a .LNK file in the Recent folder. .LNK files are shortcuts, and creating them in the Recent directory might be normal, like when you open a file. However, if the shortcut points to a malicious file, that's a problem. But the event only mentions the creation of the shortcut, not the target. Without more info, it's hard to say, but creating multiple shortcuts could be part of an attack, like phishing or tricking the user into opening a malicious file.\n\nNow, looking at the overall pattern: several User Account Management events, which might be normal administrative activities. But the EXCEL.EXE events include loading a DLL, DNS queries, and creating shortcuts. If these were isolated, maybe not suspicious, but combined with repeated DNS queries and shortcut creation, it could indicate something like a phishing attempt or malware trying to establish C2 communication.\n\nHowever, the lack of specific details like domain names in DNS queries and the target of the shortcuts makes it harder to confirm. The confidence here would be moderate. It's not a clear-cut attack, but there are enough suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. So the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show EXCEL.EXE performing suspicious actions: loading a system DLL (coml2.dll), making repeated DNS queries (potential C2 traffic), and creating shortcut files in the Recent directory (possible phishing or persistence attempt). Combined with unrelated User Account Management events, this suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
