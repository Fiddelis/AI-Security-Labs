So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's powershell.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, and others like chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe. The first event is a registry value set by powershell.exe. Not sure yet, but registry changes can be normal or malicious.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes creating a scheduled task using schtasks. The command line has a PowerShell script being executed with -ep bypass, which is a common tactic to bypass execution policies. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename says \"NonExistingScript,\" which might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to hide the real script name or it's a typo. Also, the scheduled task is set to run daily under the system account. That's suspicious because creating a task with high privileges could be part of persistence.\n\nAnother event shows schtasks.exe creating a task again, this time with a different path: c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the \"NonExistingScript\" part is odd. The task name is \"win32times,\" which doesn't seem standard. Also, the file created in the System32\\Tasks directory is named win32times, which might be a fake name to avoid detection.\n\nThere are multiple registry value set events for svchost.exe and chrome.exe. Chrome having multiple registry changes might not be normal. However, svchost.exe is a common host process, but if it's modifying the registry, that could be part of a compromise. However, the events don't show any obvious malicious activity beyond the scheduled tasks.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event is creating a file, which might be part of log collection, but the filename is .yml.new, which is a temporary file. Not sure if that's suspicious, but it's a legitimate process.\n\nThe PowerShell.exe events are accessing files, but the files mentioned don't have obvious malicious content. However, the use of -ep bypass in the command line is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity, as it's used to bypass PowerShell's execution policies, which is common in attacks.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of scheduled tasks with PowerShell scripts that don't exist (NonExistingScript) and the use of -ep bypass are red flags. The tasks are set to run daily under the system account, which is a persistence mechanism. Even though some events might be normal, the combination of these specific commands and the non-existent script names suggests an attempt to execute malicious code. Therefore, this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of scheduled tasks with PowerShell scripts using '-ep bypass' (bypassing execution policies), non-existent script filenames (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), and registry modifications by system processes. These indicators suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I'll look at each event to see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's normal. But the file path has a .new extension, which sometimes indicates a temporary file. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe creating a file called entrada_ativo.txt. PowerShell is common, but creating a file isn't necessarily bad. However, the file name is in Portuguese, which might be a red herring or could be part of a legitimate process.\n\nThen, there are two events where powershell.exe is accessing a process. The third event mentions ProcessAccess, and the fifth one is another ProcessAccess. Accessing processes could be normal, but if it's done without a clear reason, it might be suspicious. Also, the fourth event shows whoami.exe being executed, which just displays user info. That's usually benign unless used in a malicious context.\n\nPutting it all together, the main points are: multiple process creations and accesses, a new file created by winlogbeat, and a PowerShell script creating a file. However, none of the events show obvious malicious activity like downloading malware, executing suspicious commands, or accessing sensitive files. The presence of ProcessAccess might be normal if the user is running legitimate scripts. But since there's no clear indication of malicious behavior, maybe it's not interesting. However, the combination of multiple process accesses and file creations could be worth looking into further. But I'm not sure. Maybe the confidence should be medium. Justification would be that there's no clear malicious activity, but some events could be part of a larger pattern.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard process and file operations (e.g., winlogbeat file creation, PowerShell activity, whoami execution) without indicators of compromise, malicious payloads, or anomalous behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
