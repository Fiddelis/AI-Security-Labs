The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe and cmd.exe. The winlog tasks mention Process accessed and Process Create. That's normal, but then there's a command line in one of the cmd.exe entries that stands out. The command_line shows \"sc create win32times binPath= \\\"cmd \/c start c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\\\"\". Wait, that's creating a service with a path to a non-existing script. The filename has \"NonExistingScript.ps1\", which might be a red flag. Even though the script isn't found, the attempt to create a service with a malicious-sounding name could be suspicious.\n\nThen, there's another entry with sc.exe creating the same service again, but this time the path is \"c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Again, the same pattern of a non-existent script. Creating services with such names might be part of an attack to execute code later. Also, the use of \"sc qc win32times\" is querying the service configuration, which might be checking if the service was created successfully.\n\nLooking at the other processes, there's a lot of Registry value set events. That's common in normal operations, but combined with the service creation attempts, it might indicate configuration changes. However, some of these are from legitimate processes like services.exe and svchost.exe, which might be normal. But the repeated Registry events could be part of an attack's footprint.\n\nAnother thing is the Image loaded events for urlmon.dll. The calculator.exe and Calculator.exe (maybe a typo?) loading urlmon.dll. While urlmon.dll is a legitimate DLL, its loading by a calculator process might be unusual. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe it's part of a legitimate action, but combined with other events, it could be suspicious.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory is normal for log collection, but the filename has a .new extension, which might be part of a configuration change. However, that's probably benign unless there's other malicious activity around it.\n\nPutting it all together: the main red flags are the attempts to create services with non-existent scripts, which could be a sign of an attacker trying to set up persistence. The repeated Registry modifications and the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for these actions might indicate malicious intent. Even though some events are normal, the combination of service creation with non-existent scripts and multiple registry changes raises suspicion. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities could be legitimate, but the pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated attempts to create services with non-existent scripts (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), unusual registry modifications, and PowerShell\/cmd.exe usage patterns that could indicate persistence mechanisms or lateral movement. The combination of these events suggests potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at the data.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries with different processes. The first few entries have ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe with registry value set events. Then there's a Process accessed event for powershell.exe. Chrome.exe has several events too, including Pipe Created and multiple Registry value sets. Then there are Image loaded events for chrome.exe with specific DLL paths: amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Another Process accessed event for powershell.exe.\n\nHmm. Registry value set events are common in legitimate activities, but when combined with other events, they might indicate something. The Image loaded events are interesting because they show specific DLLs being loaded. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender as well. However, if these DLLs are being loaded by chrome.exe, that might be suspicious because Chrome typically doesn't need to load Defender's DLLs. That could be a sign of tampering or malware trying to disable security features.\n\nAlso, the Process accessed events for powershell.exe might indicate that someone is trying to access or manipulate the process, which could be part of an attack. However, PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities, so that alone isn't conclusive. \n\nThe repetition of Registry value set events for chrome.exe multiple times might indicate that there's some configuration change happening. But again, without more context, it's hard to say. The key points here are the Image loaded events with Defender's DLLs by chrome.exe. That seems unusual and could be a red flag. \n\nPutting it all together, the presence of these specific DLLs loaded by chrome.exe, along with multiple registry changes and process access events, might indicate a potential security issue. However, I need to be cautious. Maybe there's a legitimate reason for these DLLs being loaded. But given that the user is asking for investigation, these events do warrant further look into. So the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75. The justification is the unusual loading of Defender's DLLs by chrome.exe, which could indicate an attempt to interfere with security mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and unusual DLL loading by chrome.exe (e.g., amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll) suggest potential tampering or evasion techniques. PowerShell process access events also raise suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
