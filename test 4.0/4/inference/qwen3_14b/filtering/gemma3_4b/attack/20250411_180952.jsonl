{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe doing a DNS query, MpDefenderCoreService.exe having a network connection, and chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. These seem normal. Chrome and svchost are common processes, and DNS queries and network connections are typical. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe command, which is a standard tool to check user context. But then there's a lot of powershell.exe and cmd.exe activities. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but it can also be abused for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. \n\nLooking at the cmd.exe entry, there's a command to add a user \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" to the domain and add them to the Domain Admins group. That's a red flag. Adding users to Domain Admins is a significant privilege escalation. The password seems temporary, which might be part of a setup or attack. Also, there's another net.exe command adding another user and group membership. \n\nThen there's a net1.exe, which I'm not familiar with. Maybe a typo or a malicious binary? The path is C:\\Windows\\system32\\ which is unusual for net1.exe. Typically, system binaries are in system32, but net1.exe isn't standard. That's suspicious. \n\nThere are multiple Registry value set events from cmd.exe and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or modifying system settings. Also, the creation of files like .winlogbeat.yml.new and pacote_base.txt. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, but creating config files might be normal, but in combination with other events, it could be part of an attack.\n\nThe svchost.exe creating SRUtmp.log is normal, as that's part of the System Resource Usage tracking. But the repeated entries might be normal system activity.\n\nPutting this all together: the presence of multiple user additions to Domain Admins, using cmd.exe and net.exe with domain commands, and the use of non-standard executables like net1.exe. These activities suggest someone is trying to escalate privileges and modify system configurations, which is highly suspicious. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events points to a potential security incident. The confidence is high because adding domain admins and using suspicious executables are clear indicators of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: domain user\/group modifications via cmd\/net.exe, non-standard 'net1.exe' execution, and potential privilege escalation. These indicate possible lateral movement or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a batch of four events in JSONL format. My job is to analyze them as a whole and determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. The first one is svchost.exe creating a file at C:\\Windows\\System32\\sru\\SRUtmp.log. I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. The file path mentioned is part of the System Restore User (SRU) directory, which is used for temporary logs. Creating a file here might be normal, especially if it's related to system restore operations. But I should check if there's any suspicious activity here. However, the event just says \"File created\" without any other context, so maybe it's benign.\n\nThe second event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and forwarding logs. The file path is a .yml.new file, which could be part of a configuration setup. However, the presence of \"new\" in the filename might indicate that it's a temporary file being written, which is normal during configuration changes. But if this is unexpected, it might be worth looking into. However, since the user is fiddelis, maybe they're just installing or configuring winlogbeat, which is common.\n\nThe third event is powershell.exe setting a registry value. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. Setting a registry value could be part of a script or configuration change. However, without more context, like which registry key was modified or what the value is, it's hard to tell. But this alone might not be suspicious.\n\nThe fourth event is powershell.exe accessing a process. Again, PowerShell can be used to access processes for legitimate reasons, like troubleshooting or automation. But if it's accessing processes that are not typically accessed, that could be a red flag. However, the event doesn't specify which process was accessed, so it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, looking at the combination of events. The first two events involve file creation by legitimate processes in expected locations. The third and fourth events involve PowerShell doing registry and process access. But without more context, like unusual parameters, unexpected registry keys, or accessing sensitive processes, these might be normal activities. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events might be a sign of something, but not necessarily malicious. \n\nWait, but maybe the user is trying to see if there's a pattern. For example, if the PowerShell events are related to the other file creations. But the first two events are about different processes. The third and fourth are about PowerShell, but not linked to the other files. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the combination of svchost.exe creating a file in SRUtmp.log and PowerShell activities could be part of a larger attack. However, without more evidence, like network activity, unexpected processes, or other suspicious logs, it's hard to say. \n\nI need to consider if these events are normal or if they indicate a potential threat. The first event is likely normal. The second might be a configuration change. The PowerShell events could be part of a script, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nSince the justification requires a concise explanation, and the confidence is a float. Considering that there's no clear malicious activity here, but also no obvious benign context, maybe it's not interesting. However, the presence of PowerShell events might be a red flag. But since the user is using winlogbeat, which is a legitimate tool, and svchost is normal, maybe this is just regular system activity. \n\nI think the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because none of the events show clear signs of malicious activity. The justification would be that all events involve legitimate processes and normal system activities. Confidence around 0.6 because while there's no clear threat, the PowerShell events could be a minor concern, but without more data, it's not enough to classify as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) performing normal system operations (file creation, registry access) in expected locations. No clear indicators of compromise or suspicious patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
