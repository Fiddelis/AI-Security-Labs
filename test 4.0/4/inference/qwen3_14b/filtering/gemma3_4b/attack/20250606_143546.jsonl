The files mentioned are mostly system-related, like in the SoftwareDistribution folder, which I know is related to Windows updates. \n\nNow, HxTsr.exe stands out because I don't recall that being a standard Windows process. It might be a third-party or potentially malicious software. Then there's the sppsvc.exe creating a file in the store cache, which seems normal for activation services. The PowerShell activity creating a StartupProfileData file might be legitimate, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious scripts. \n\nThe svchost.exe entries are common, as they host various system services. However, the multiple File created events under SoftwareDistribution's Metadata folder could be part of a legitimate update process.

Also, the Image loaded events for urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll are standard, but if they're being loaded from unexpected places, that could be a red flag. \n\nI need to check if there's any pattern here.

However, the fact that there are multiple registry changes and file creations might be normal, but I need to check for any suspicious patterns.\n\nLooking at the file paths, there's a mention of waasmedic.etl and edbtmp.log. These are typically related to Windows Update and the Software Distribution service. The file created in the SoftwareDistribution folder might be part of normal update processes. However, the repeated registry value sets could be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys. But since the logs don't specify the registry keys being changed, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is that the process is svchost.exe in most cases, which is legitimate.

The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe is involved in registry value set and file creation events. The files are in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install directory, and one of them is AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe. That looks like a patch file, maybe part of an update. But svchost.exe is a normal system process, so creating files there might be legitimate, like Windows Update.\n\nThen there's MpSigStub.exe, which is related to Windows Defender. It's creating files in the Temp directory with names like mpasdlta.vdm and mpavdlta.vdm. These could be temporary files for updates or definitions. However, the presence of multiple files being created might be normal during an update cycle. But I should check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nNext, setup.exe is creating several files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory, like ie_to_edge_stub.exe and elevation_service.exe. These files seem to be part of an installation or update process for Edge. But why are they being created in that directory? Maybe it's a legitimate installation, but sometimes malware can disguise itself as legitimate processes. However, setup.exe is a common installer, so this could be normal.\n\nThere's also an event where RuntimeBroker.exe is setting a registry value. RuntimeBroker is usually associated with UWP apps, so that might be normal. The powershell.exe event shows a process access, which isn't inherently malicious but could be part of a script. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, looking for red flags. The files created by MpSigStub.exe in Temp might be temporary, but the names like mpasdlta.vdm and mpavdlta.vdm could be related to Defender definitions. However, the presence of multiple files and the fact that they're in Temp might be okay. The svchost.exe creating a patch file in SoftwareDistribution is likely part of Windows Update. The setup.exe creating Edge-related files is probably an installation.\n\nBut wait, are there any anomalies? For example, if these files were created without user consent or in unusual locations. However, the paths mentioned are standard for updates and installations. Also, the processes involved are legitimate system processes. There's no mention of network activity, unusual registry changes, or other suspicious behaviors. The events seem to be part of normal system operations like updates and installations.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple file creations and registry changes could be part of a larger activity. But without more data, like error messages or unexpected processes, it's hard to say. Maybe the user is concerned because these events are occurring in a short time frame or in a non-expected context. But based solely on the provided information, these events appear to be legitimate system activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event logs indicate a mix of **legitimate system activities** and **potential indicators of compromise (IoCs)**, but **no definitive malicious activity** is confirmed. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n1. **Windows Update\/Patch Installation**:\n   - `svchost.exe` creating `AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe` in `SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install` is consistent with **Windows Update** processes.\n   - `MpSigStub.exe` generating temporary files (e.g., `mpasdlta.vdm`, `mpavdlta.vdm`) in the `Temp` directory aligns with **Windows Defender definition updates**.\n\n2. **Edge Installation\/Update**:\n   - `setup.exe` creating files in `Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeCore` (e.g., `elevated_tracing_service.exe`, `identity_helper.exe`) is typical during **Microsoft Edge installation or updates**.\n\n3. **Standard System Processes**:\n   - `RuntimeBroker.exe` modifying registry values is normal for **UWP app management**.\n   - `powershell.exe` process access events are common for **scripting or system administration tasks**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Red Flags**\n1. **Unusual File Creation Patterns**:\n   - The **volume of file creation** by `MpSigStub.exe` and `setup.exe` could be **abnormal** if not tied to a known update\/installation event. However, this alone is not conclusive.\n\n2. **Process Involvement**:\n   - `svchost.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe` are **legitimate**, but their involvement in file creation\/registry changes should be cross-checked with **system logs** (e.g., `Event Viewer`) to confirm they are part of expected processes.\n\n3. **Lack of Context**:\n   - No **error codes**, **user interaction**, or **network activity** is mentioned, making it difficult to determine if these events are **isolated** or part of a larger attack chain.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs**: Check for **Windows Update logs**, **Defender scan activity**, or **user-initiated installations** to confirm legitimacy.\n- **Monitor for Anomalies**: If these events occur **outside of scheduled updates** or **without user consent**, further investigation is warranted.\n- **Check File Hashes**: Verify the integrity of files like `AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe` using **Windows Update Catalog** or **VirusTotal** to rule out tampering.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events **could represent normal system behavior** (e.g., updates, installations), but **further context** is needed to rule out **malicious activity**. **No immediate threat** is evident, but **monitoring and correlation** with other logs are recommended. \n\n**Verdict**: **Low risk** (likely legitimate), but **investigate further** if these events are unexpected or uncorrelated with known system activities."}

Let me start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there's a 'whoami.exe' process created. That's a normal Windows utility, so probably benign. Then there are several 'powershell.exe' events. PowerShell is common, but sometimes used for malicious activities. Let me check the command lines.\n\nLooking at the fourth event, the command line is a PowerShell script that uses New-Service to create a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". Then it starts the service. That seems suspicious because creating a new service with a custom executable isn't typical. The path also looks unusual and not part of standard Windows directories.\n\nNext, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell loading .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are normal for PowerShell, but the presence of several might be normal too. However, the creation of a new service with a non-standard executable is a red flag.\n\nThen there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory. That's common for scripts, but the fact that it's followed by a deletion could be an attempt to clean up evidence. Also, the file name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be a misleading name to appear legitimate.\n\nOther events involve Registry value sets by 'services.exe', but that's part of Windows services management. However, multiple registry changes might indicate configuration changes, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of a new service with a suspicious executable path, along with PowerShell activities that include creating and deleting temporary files, suggests potential malicious behavior.

The first few entries show the process 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading several DLLs from standard Windows directories like System32 and the .NET Framework. Those paths look legitimate, so maybe that's normal operation.\n\nThen there's a 'File created' event for PowerShell's StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That might be part of normal PowerShell setup, but not sure yet. The next event is a registry value set by PowerShell, which could be benign or part of some configuration.\n\nBut then things get interesting. There are multiple entries where a process with no name (maybe a remote command?) is executing a script called 'componente_auxiliar.ps1' from the path 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario'. The command line shows importing that module and trying to run 'Invoke-entrada_principal' with OutputDirectory set to the Temp folder. Also, there's a lot of repetition of the same command line in multiple logs, which might indicate a script that's being run repeatedly or logged multiple times.\n\nThe use of 'Invoke-entrada_principal' (which translates to 'Invoke-main-entry' in Portuguese) suggests some kind of main function or entry point being called. The fact that it's in a temporary directory could be a red flag, as attackers often use temp folders to execute malicious code. Also, the path 'C:\\unidade_logico' (which might be 'logical unit' in Portuguese) doesn't look like a standard Windows directory, which could be a custom or suspicious location.\n\nThe repeated execution of the same PowerShell command, combined with loading DLLs from .NET and then executing a script from a non-standard path, raises suspicion. It could be part of a legitimate application, but the combination of these events, especially the remote command execution and the use of temp directories, makes me think this might be malicious. The presence of error handling with exit codes and the Sleep command might be part of a larger attack sequence to avoid detection.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch shows both normal .NET operations and suspicious PowerShell activity that could indicate a potential security threat.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the process events. There's a PowerShell command that imports a module from \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". Then it tries to invoke something called \"Invoke-entrada_principal\" with an output directory set to the Temp folder. If there's an error, it exits with the exception's HRESULT. Then it sleeps for 5 seconds. Hmm, that seems a bit suspicious. Using PowerShell to import a module from a path that has '..\\\\' might indicate moving up a directory, which could be a way to access files outside the intended directory. Also, the use of try-catch to handle errors and exit with HRESULT might be part of a script that's trying to be stealthy.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is used to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with the binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\" located in \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\...\". Then the service is started. The repetition of this command in several logs (multiple entries with the same command_line) might indicate that this is part of an automated process or a script that's being executed multiple times. Creating a new service and starting it could be a way to install a backdoor or persistent malware on the system. Also, the fact that the same command is logged multiple times might suggest that the attacker is trying to ensure the service is created and running, possibly after some initial attempts failed.\n\nThen there are entries under the \"Execute a Remote Command\" task, which involve the file \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\" being executed. The path here is \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The repetition here as well—multiple logs pointing to the same file being executed. That could mean that this script is being run multiple times, perhaps as part of a larger attack chain. The combination of importing a module, creating a service, and executing remote commands might be part of a multi-stage attack. For example, the initial script could be downloading or executing another payload, then creating a service for persistence.\n\nLooking at the paths, \"unidade_logico\" and \"registro_comum\" might be part of a naming convention that's not standard, which could be a red flag. Also, the use of \"registro_secundario\" and \"registro_comum\" might be part of a structure that's being used to hide malicious activities under what seems like legitimate directories. The fact that the service is named \"objeto_ativo\" and the executable is \"tarefa_logico.exe\" could be obfuscated names to avoid detection. These names don't immediately ring a bell as standard system services, so that's another point to consider.\n\nThe confidence here would depend on how common these activities are. Creating services and executing PowerShell scripts are common in both legitimate and malicious contexts. However, the combination of multiple service creations, repeated execution of the same script, and the use of non-standard paths increases the likelihood of malicious intent. Also, the presence of error handling in the script (try-catch) might be an attempt to avoid detection by handling errors gracefully rather than crashing, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of the Temp directory as an output location. That's a common place for malware to store temporary files, which can be a sign of malicious activity. The sleep command (Start-Sleep) might be used to delay execution, possibly to avoid detection by timing-based analysis or to coordinate with other parts of the attack.\n\nPutting this all together, the logs show a pattern of activities that are commonly associated with malware installation: creating a service for persistence, executing scripts from non-standard paths, and using error handling to avoid detection. The repetition of the same commands in multiple logs suggests that these actions are being carried out repeatedly, which could be part of an attempt to establish a foothold in the system. Therefore, these events are likely to be interesting for investigation as they may indicate a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate **potentially malicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **PowerShell Script Execution with Obfuscation**:\n   - A PowerShell script (`componente_auxiliar.ps1`) is repeatedly executed under the task **\"Execute a Remote Command\"**. This script is located in a non-standard path (`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\...`), which may be obfuscated to avoid detection.\n   - The script imports a module from a path containing `..\\\\` (directory traversal), which could indicate an attempt to access files outside the intended directory structure.\n\n2. **Service Creation for Persistence**:\n   - Multiple logs show the creation of a service named **`objeto_ativo`** with the binary path pointing to **`tarefa_logico.exe`** in `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\...`. This is a common tactic for malware to establish persistence on a system.\n   - The repetition of this command across logs suggests **automated or repeated execution**, possibly to ensure the service is created despite initial failures.\n\n3. **Error Handling and Stealth**:\n   - The script uses a `try-catch` block to handle errors and exits with the HRESULT of any exception. This is often used in malware to avoid leaving traces or crashing, making detection harder.\n\n4. **Non-Standard File Names and Paths**:\n   - The service name (`objeto_ativo`) and executable (`tarefa_logico.exe`) use non-English, obfuscated names, which may be an attempt to evade signature-based detection.\n   - The directory structure (`unidade_logico`, `registro_comum`, etc.) is not typical for standard system components, raising suspicion.\n\n5. **Temporary Directory Usage**:\n   - The script specifies the **Temp directory** (`%TEMP%`) as an output location, a common practice for malware to store transient files.\n\n---\n\n### **Likely Scenario**\nThe logs suggest a **multi-stage attack**:\n1. **Initial Execution**: The script `componente_auxiliar.ps1` is executed remotely, possibly via phishing, exploit, or compromised credentials.\n2. **Persistence**: The attacker creates a service (`objeto_ativo`) to ensure long-term access to the system.\n3. **Stealth**: The use of obfuscated names, error handling, and directory traversal indicates an attempt to avoid detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Investigate the Script**: Analyze `componente_auxiliar.ps1` and `tarefa_logico.exe` for malicious payloads (e.g., using sandboxes, YARA rules, or static analysis).\n- **Check for Unauthorized Services**: Verify if `objeto_ativo` is a legitimate service or a backdoor.\n- **Audit Network Traffic**: Look for communication with external C2 servers or data exfiltration.\n- **Monitor User Activity**: Check if the script was executed by a legitimate user or via compromised credentials.\n\n---\n\n### **Confidence Level**\n**High** (90%+). The combination of repeated service creation, obfuscated paths, and stealthy scripting techniques strongly suggests malicious activity. However, further forensic analysis is required to confirm the threat. \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: These logs are **highly suspicious** and should be prioritized for investigation. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate potential compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries.\n\nMost of the events here have the task 'Execute a Remote Command' and the same file path: 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. That's a PowerShell script. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. But the repetition here is notable. There are multiple entries with the same process and file, which could indicate something like a script being executed multiple times, maybe in a loop or as part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there are a few other tasks like 'Logon', 'Special Logon', and 'Security Group Management'. However, the majority are the same task and file. The fact that the same file is being executed repeatedly might be suspicious. Even if it's a legitimate script, doing it multiple times could be a red flag. However, I need to consider if there's any context missing. For example, are these events part of a normal process? But the process is listed as 'None' for most entries, which might mean that the event is being logged without an associated process, which could be an anomaly itself.\n\nWait, the 'process' field is 'None' for most entries. The ones that do have a process are 'services.exe', which is a legitimate Windows process. But the repeated executions of the same PowerShell script without an associated process could indicate that the script is being run in a way that's not tied to a known process, which might be a sign of something malicious. Also, the file path has some non-English terms like 'unidade_logico' (which is Portuguese for 'logical unit') and 'registro_secundario' (secondary record). That might be a red herring, but it's also possible that the script is named in a way to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is that the task 'Execute a Remote Command' is often associated with remote code execution, which is a common attack vector. If this is happening multiple times, especially from the same file, it could be part of a broader attack. However, I should also consider that the logs might be from a system that's under normal operations, but the repetition is a key factor here.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple executions of the same PowerShell script, same task, and the process is missing for most. This pattern is more likely to be a security incident than a normal activity. Therefore, the classification should be 'INTERESTING' with a confidence level around 0.85. The justification is the repeated execution of the same script with the same task, which is a common indicator of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated executions of the same PowerShell script (componente_auxiliar.ps1) with 'Execute a Remote Command' task, which is a common indicator of malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are a bunch of entries here. The first thing I notice is that almost all of them have the same structure. The process is \"None\", the winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\", and the file path is \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". There are 16 entries like that, and then a couple of others with the task \"Windows Update Agent\" and no file.\n\nHmm, executing a remote command via a PowerShell script multiple times seems suspicious. Especially if it's the same script every time. PowerShell scripts are often used in attacks, especially if they're being executed remotely. The fact that it's repeated so many times could indicate an ongoing attempt or a persistent threat. But wait, the process is \"None\"—maybe that's a red flag. If the process isn't recorded, it might mean the system couldn't identify the process, which could be a sign of something evading detection.\n\nThen there are the two entries about the Windows Update Agent. Those might be normal, but if they're mixed in with the suspicious ones, maybe it's a way to blend in. However, the majority of the logs are the same. The repetition of the same file path and task is a strong indicator of something automated or malicious. Also, the file name \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\" translates to \"auxiliary component\" in Portuguese. That might be a red herring, but it's a script that's being run a lot.\n\nBut wait, could this be a false positive? Maybe the system is just logging normal operations. However, \"Execute a Remote Command\" sounds like a command that would be used in a penetration test or an attack. If this is happening repeatedly, it's more likely malicious. Also, the path seems to be in a non-standard location like \"unidade_logico\" which might be a typo or a custom directory. That's not typical for standard system processes.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the confidence level. Since all the events are the same, it's a pattern. If this were a normal activity, there might be variation. The fact that it's all the same could point to a script being run multiple times, possibly for persistence or data exfiltration. But without more context, like the source of the remote command or the user involved, it's a bit tricky. However, the sheer number of identical events is concerning.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the same PowerShell script being executed multiple times via remote command, same file path, same process (or lack thereof), and the repetition.
