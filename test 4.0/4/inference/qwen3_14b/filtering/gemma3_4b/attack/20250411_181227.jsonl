So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances of powershell.exe executing commands. The command lines are similar, using PowerShell to create scheduled tasks. The key parts here are the actions, triggers, and principals. The action is executing calc.exe, which is a legitimate Windows application, but the trigger is set to run at logon. The principal is set to the Administrators group with the highest run level. That's a red flag because creating a scheduled task that runs as an administrator at logon could be part of a persistence mechanism, which is common in malware.\n\nNow, the names of the scheduled tasks are things like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", \"entrada_ativo\", etc. These names don't seem to be standard or well-known, which might indicate they're custom-created, possibly by an attacker. The repetition of these commands across multiple events suggests a pattern. Even though calc.exe is a normal program, the use of scheduled tasks with admin rights is suspicious, especially if this is happening multiple times.\n\nAdditionally, there are other events related to PowerShell, like registry value sets and process accesses. However, the most concerning part is the scheduled task creation. The confidence here is high because creating multiple scheduled tasks with admin privileges is a known tactic in attacks. Even though the justification might not be 100% certain, the combination of these factors makes it a strong candidate for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with high privileges (RunLevel Highest) for the Administrators group, executing calc.exe at logon.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: they're all about 'powershell.exe' loading various DLLs like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These are all legitimate system files, part of .NET and Windows Defender. Loading these doesn't seem suspicious on its own. But then there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute something temporarily without leaving traces. The file is a PowerShell script, which might be part of a script that's being run and then cleaned up.\n\nNext, there's an event where PowerShell is used to create a scheduled task with 'calc.exe' as the action, triggered at logon, and set to run as Administrators with highest privileges. That's a red flag. Using Scheduled Tasks to execute calc.exe isn't normal; usually, calc.exe is just a test application. If this is part of a malicious payload, it could be a way to maintain persistence or execute code with elevated rights. The command line shows the use of New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask, which are PowerShell cmdlets that can be abused for such purposes.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. However, since they're all from chrome.exe and the task is 'Registry value set', it might be related to Chrome's own operations, like updating settings or extensions. Without more context, it's hard to tell, but if there's a pattern of excessive or unusual registry changes, that could be suspicious. However, the repetition here might just be normal behavior.\n\nThe last several events are about 'Execute a Remote Command' with the process field as None. That's odd. If the process is None, it might indicate that the event is not properly logged or there's a missing process name. However, multiple entries of 'Execute a Remote Command' could suggest that there's an attempt to run commands remotely, which is a security concern. But since the process is missing, it's unclear if this is legitimate or malicious.\n\nPutting this all together: the PowerShell events, especially the scheduled task creation with elevated privileges and the temporary file creation\/deletion, are suspicious. The other events might be benign, but the combination of these actions could indicate an attempt to compromise the system. The confidence here is moderate because while some events are suspicious, others are normal. However, the presence of the scheduled task with admin rights is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show suspicious behavior: temporary script creation\/deletion, loading of legitimate system DLLs (possibly for evasion), and a scheduled task creation with elevated privileges (Administrators group) executing calc.exe. These could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious code.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple lines where the process is None, and the winlog task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. That's a red flag. Repeated remote command executions could indicate someone trying to run commands on the system remotely, which is suspicious. But I need to check if there's more context.\n\nThen, there's an entry with a process that's a PowerShell command. The command_line shows creating a scheduled task with 'calc.exe' and setting the principal to Administrators with high privileges. That's odd because normally, you wouldn't set up a scheduled task to run calc.exe unless it's a test, but combined with the high privileges, it might be part of a larger malicious activity. The task name is 'unidade_comum$object' which seems like a random or obfuscated name, which is common in malware.\n\nNext, there's a process 'WmiPrvSE.exe' loading 'taskschd.dll'. WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation, and loading taskschd.dll (which is part of Task Scheduler) might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be part of an attack. However, I need to see if there's any other suspicious activity here.\n\nThen, multiple 'svchost.exe' processes setting registry values. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, but repeated registry changes could be an indicator of something trying to modify system settings. However, without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nAnother entry shows 'svchost.exe' creating a file in 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum'. System32 is a protected directory, and creating files there without proper authorization is suspicious. The filename 'unidade_comum' might be a placeholder or obfuscated name again.\n\nThen, there's a PowerShell process creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for legitimate scripts, but combined with other events, it might be part of a larger attack. Also, another PowerShell process creating a file named 'entrada_principal.txt' in Downloads. Not sure if that's suspicious on its own.\n\nChrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender's anti-malware scanning, and MpOAV is from Windows Defender as well. Loading these might be normal if Chrome is interacting with them, but it's worth checking if there's any unusual behavior here. However, the presence of these DLLs being loaded by Chrome might be legitimate, especially if the user is running Chrome with Defender enabled.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat process creating a YAML file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file is normal. However, the file is in the Downloads directory, which might be a red flag if it's not part of a legitimate setup.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events, the PowerShell creating a scheduled task with admin privileges, the file creation in System32's Tasks directory, and the registry changes by svchost.exe all point towards potential malicious activity. The fact that the scheduled task is using calc.exe (a benign application) might be a test, but the high privileges and the obfuscated task name are suspicious. The other events, like Chrome loading Defender DLLs and Winlogbeat creating a config file, might be benign, but combined with the other suspicious events, it's worth investigating.\n\nConfidence is a bit tricky. There are multiple suspicious events, but some could be false positives. However, the combination of remote command executions, scheduled task creation with admin rights, and file creation in protected directories gives me a confidence level around 0.75. It's not 100% certain, but enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events including repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' attempts, PowerShell creating a high-privilege scheduled task with obfuscated name, and file creation in protected System32\/Tasks directory.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user wants me to analyze all these events together and decide if they should be investigated.\n\nLooking at the logs, the first eight entries are all about chrome.exe performing a registry value set operation. The task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and the file is None. Now, chrome.exe is a common browser, and changing registry values isn't normal for it. But maybe it's part of normal operations? Wait, but if it's doing this multiple times, maybe that's suspicious. However, I need to check if there's anything else.\n\nThen there's the ninth event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. The path is in the Downloads folder, which is okay, but maybe not a big red flag. The next event is powershell.exe creating a file called \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\". The name seems random, maybe a placeholder. But creating a file isn't necessarily malicious unless there's more context.\n\nNow, the key here is that all the first eight events are the same: chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times. That's a lot of repeated events. Normally, a browser might not modify the registry that much. If this is part of a legitimate process, maybe it's something like updating settings, but repeated registry changes could be a sign of something else, like a malware trying to persist or alter system settings. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being changed, it's hard to tell. \n\nBut the other events don't show any obvious malicious activity. The file creation by winlogbeat seems normal, and the powershell-created file might just be a temporary file. However, the repetition of the same event eight times with chrome.exe might indicate a potential issue. Maybe a script is running that's modifying the registry multiple times, which could be part of a larger attack. But on the other hand, if it's a legitimate process, like a browser extension or some background task, it might be normal.\n\nI need to weigh the significance. Repeated registry modifications by a browser could be a red flag, but without more information, like the specific registry keys or other processes involved, it's a bit ambiguous. The other events don't seem to be problematic. So maybe the classification is \"INTERESTING\" because of the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe, which is unusual and could indicate a potential threat. However, the confidence might not be extremely high because there's not enough data to confirm it's malicious. But the presence of multiple similar events might be enough to flag it for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated registry modification events by chrome.exe (8 instances) may indicate anomalous behavior, as browsers typically do not frequently modify registry values. This could suggest potential persistence mechanisms or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
