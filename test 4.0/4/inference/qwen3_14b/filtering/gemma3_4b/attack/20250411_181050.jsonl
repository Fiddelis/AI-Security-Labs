{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these logs. The first thing I notice is the use of certutil.exe with commands to encode and decode files. That's often used for hiding data, which can be suspicious. There's a cmd.exe process running a command that uses certutil to encode calc.exe into a temporary file and then decode it back. That seems like it might be part of a payload delivery.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for certutil.exe creating files in the Temp directory. The file names are a bit obfuscated, which is a red flag. Also, the command line arguments involve encoding and decoding, which might be used to execute malicious code without leaving obvious traces.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of rundll32.exe executing a DLL from PcaSvc.dll. That's not typical and could indicate a malicious payload. Also, SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll might be part of a malicious process, as those are standard system files but their loading here seems out of context.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is usually benign, but combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of information gathering. The use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with various registry modifications could be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\nThe Chrome process and DNS queries might be normal, but when combined with the other suspicious activities, it's worth looking into. The file creation by winlogbeat.exe seems legitimate, but the rest of the events are more concerning.\n\nOverall, the combination of certutil usage, temporary file creation, and unusual process executions points towards potential malicious activity. The confidence is high enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files (potential payload delivery), rundll32.exe executing PcaSvc.dll (unusual), SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs (possible malicious process), and temporary file creation in AppData\/Local\/Temp (common in malware). Combined with registry modifications and process injections, this suggests potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries with chrome.exe related to Network connection detected (NetworkConnect). That's common for browsers, so maybe normal activity. But then there's a powershell.exe event where a file is created: componente_auxiliar.txt in the Downloads folder. That might be suspicious, but not sure yet. \n\nThen, there are several Registry value set events from chrome.exe. Chrome modifying the registry could be normal, but maybe if it's doing a lot, but the count here is 8 times. Wait, looking again, there are 8 entries with RegistryEvent for chrome.exe. That seems a bit much. But maybe it's just normal operations. \n\nThen, there's an entry for SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. Hmm, SDXHelper isn't a standard Windows process. Maybe a third-party app, but I should check if that's legitimate. Also, urlmon.dll is a legitimate DLL, but if it's being loaded by an unexpected process, that could be a red flag. However, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is correct. So maybe that's okay.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be part of its setup. But why is it in the Downloads folder? Maybe the user is installing it there. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nThen, powershell.exe has a couple of ProcessAccess events. Process access can be normal, but if it's accessing other processes without proper authorization, that could be an issue. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting this all together: The majority of events are from chrome.exe and normal activities. The standout is the powershell.exe creating a file in Downloads, but that alone might not be suspicious. The SDXHelper.exe loading a legitimate DLL might not be an issue. The multiple registry events from chrome.exe might be normal, but the high number could be worth checking. However, since there's no clear indication of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, file modifications, or unauthorized access, maybe this isn't interesting. But I need to be careful. Are there any other anomalies?\n\nWait, the file created by powershell is componente_auxiliar.txt. The name is in Portuguese, which might be benign, but sometimes attackers use such names to blend in. However, without knowing the context, it's hard to say. Also, the user might have downloaded it themselves. \n\nThe other events don't show any signs of malware or suspicious behavior. So, maybe this is just normal user activity. Therefore, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6, because there are some unusual events but nothing conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Most events involve benign processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe) performing typical operations (network connections, file creation, registry modifications). The SDXHelper.exe and winlogbeat.exe activities involve legitimate system components or user-installed tools. No clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
