{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each representing a system log event. My job is to analyze them all together and decide if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created. The process involved is \"SDXHelper.exe\". Now, SDXHelper might be part of some software, maybe a legitimate one, but I should check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the \"Office\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\" directory. That seems a bit odd. Office usually has its own set of files, but creating multiple JavaScript files (from the .min.js extensions) in an OfflineFiles folder might not be standard. Typically, OfflineFiles could be related to cached data, but generating so many JS files here is unusual.\n\nNext, the filenames are all minified JavaScript files with unique hashes. That's common in web development, but when they're being created on a local system, especially in a directory that's not typically used for such files, it raises a red flag. It could indicate that some malicious script is being downloaded and executed, or maybe a legitimate app is doing something unexpected.\n\nAlso, all the events are from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. If this process is legitimate, why is it creating so many files? Maybe it's part of an update or a feature that's not well-known. However, without knowing what SDXHelper is, it's hard to say. But considering the context, the sheer number of files created in a short period might be indicative of malware behavior, like downloading and executing multiple scripts.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there's only one event related to \"BitsTransfer.exe\" which is part of Windows Update. But the rest are all SDXHelper. That might not be directly related, but it's worth considering if there's a connection between the updates and the file creation.\n\nI should also think about the possibility of a false positive. Maybe SDXHelper is a legitimate helper tool for some software, and this is normal behavior. However, the lack of any other events (like process starts, network activity, etc.) makes it hard to confirm. The logs provided are only about file creation, so there's not enough context.\n\nIn cybersecurity, creating multiple files in non-standard directories, especially with minified code, is often a sign of malicious activity. The fact that all these files are JavaScript could mean they're being used to execute code on the system, perhaps as part of a payload.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the unusual file creation in a non-standard directory, the high volume of files, and the use of minified JavaScript files all point towards potential malicious activity. Unless there's a known legitimate reason for this behavior, it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system logs show a pattern of activity that warrants further investigation due to several suspicious indicators:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **High Volume of File Creations:**\n   - **17+ events** from `SDXHelper.exe` creating **minified JavaScript (.min.js)** files in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`.\n   - This is highly unusual for standard Office operations, which typically do not generate such files in the `OfflineFiles` directory.\n\n2. **Unusual File Naming and Content:**\n   - All files have **unique hash-based names** (e.g., `min_0d1ad4f1e67587dbd451127cb72e2305.js`), a common tactic in malware to evade detection.\n   - **Minified JavaScript** files are often associated with **malicious payloads** or **obfuscated scripts** (e.g., droppers, loaders, or exfiltration tools).\n\n3. **Lack of Contextual Clues:**\n   - No accompanying logs (e.g., process creation, network activity, or registry changes) provide context for `SDXHelper.exe`.\n   - No evidence of legitimate software updates or user-initiated actions (e.g., software installation, downloads).\n\n4. **Directory Anomalies:**\n   - `OfflineFiles` is typically used for **cached resources** (e.g., by Windows Update or Office), but **generating executable scripts** here is atypical and potentially malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats:**\n- **Malware Activity:**  \n  The behavior aligns with **malware** that downloads and executes scripts locally (e.g., a **loader** or **dropper**).\n- **Persistence Mechanism:**  \n  The files could be part of a **persistence strategy** (e.g., injecting code into legitimate processes or establishing a backdoor).\n- **Data Exfiltration:**  \n  JavaScript files might be used to **exfiltrate data** or **communicate with a C2 server**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:**  \n   - Check its **digital signature**, **file hash**, and **parent process** to determine legitimacy.\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to analyze the process.\n\n2. **Scan for Malware:**  \n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/EDR tools (e.g., Windows Defender, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne).\n\n3. **Monitor Network Activity:**  \n   - Check if the system is communicating with **suspicious domains\/IPs** (e.g., via `netstat`, Wireshark, or EDR logs).\n\n4. **Check for User Consent:**  \n   - Determine if the user intentionally installed software that could involve `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n5. **Isolate the System (if necessary):**  \n   - If malware is confirmed, isolate the system and perform a **forensic analysis**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs strongly suggest **suspicious behavior** consistent with **malware activity**. Immediate investigation is recommended to confirm the threat and mitigate risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office Resources directory. The files all have names that start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a long hexadecimal string and ending with .js. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. I know that some legitimate software uses this name, but it's also been associated with malware. However, the presence of multiple file creations might be normal if it's part of an update or installation process. But the fact that all these files are JavaScript minified files could be a red flag. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that these are logs from a system, so maybe they're looking for signs of malicious activity. The files are being created in the Office Resources folder, which is a legitimate directory for Microsoft Office. However, the repetition of the same process creating many files might indicate something. \n\nI should check if the hexadecimal strings are random. If they are, that could be a sign of generated files, which might be part of a malicious payload. Also, minified JavaScript files are common in legitimate software, but if they're being created in large numbers without user interaction, that's suspicious. \n\nAnother point is the lack of other processes or events. If this is the only activity, it might be benign. But if there are no other logs related to updates or installations, it's more concerning. Since the user hasn't provided more context, I should consider both possibilities. \n\nBut looking at the file names again, \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" â€“ maybe that's a typo or a misinterpretation. Could it be related to \"AI Copilot\"? Microsoft's Copilot feature? If so, maybe these are legitimate updates. However, the naming convention seems a bit off. \n\nI should also consider that some malware uses similar naming conventions to blend in. The fact that the same process is creating multiple files might be part of a dropper or a downloader. However, without more data like process parentage, network activity, or user interaction, it's hard to say for sure. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's no definitive proof of malicious intent here, the unusual number of files created by a single process in a legitimate directory, combined with the minified JavaScript files, raises some red flags. It's worth further investigation, such as checking the digital signatures of the files, looking for other suspicious activities, or using antivirus tools to scan the files.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Provided Logs:**\n\nThe logs indicate repeated creation of JavaScript minified files (`*.min.js`) by the process `SDXHelper.exe` in the directory `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Resources`. The filenames follow a pattern: `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hexadecimal string>`. Below is the breakdown of findings:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process and File Behavior:**\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is the process creating all files. This process is **not inherently malicious** but is **not a standard Windows process**. It is commonly associated with **Microsoft Office updates** or **third-party software** (e.g., some legitimate applications use this name).\n   - The files are **JavaScript minified files** (`*.min.js`), which are common in legitimate software (e.g., web applications, Office add-ins). However, the **large number of files** and **non-standard naming** raise concerns.\n\n2. **File Naming Anomalies:**\n   - The filenames contain **random hexadecimal strings** (e.g., `4821ae2dea51d5052f57184aa468b690`). This suggests **automated generation** of files, which could be:\n     - **Legitimate**: Part of a software update or dynamic resource loading (e.g., AI Copilot features in Office).\n     - **Suspicious**: A potential indicator of **malware droppers** or **payloads** (e.g., generated files to evade detection).\n\n3. **Directory Context:**\n   - The files are created in the **Microsoft Office Resources directory**, which is a **legitimate location** for Office-related files. However, **unauthorized file creation** here could indicate **compromise** (e.g., malware masquerading as a legitimate process).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats:**\n- **Malware Infection:** If `SDXHelper.exe` is not a legitimate process (e.g., no valid digital signature or mismatched file path), the files could be **malicious payloads** (e.g., scripts for data exfiltration, persistence, or exploitation).\n- **Resource Exhaustion:** The creation of numerous files could **consume disk space** or **slow down the system**.\n- **Bypassing Detection:** The use of random hexadecimal strings in filenames may be an attempt to **evade signature-based detection**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy:**\n   - Check the **file path** of `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\...` vs. `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\...`).\n   - Confirm the **digital signature** of the executable (right-click > Properties > Digital Signatures).\n\n2. **Analyze Files:**\n   - Use a **sandbox** or **static analysis tool** (e.g., VirusTotal, IDA Pro) to inspect the contents of the `.min.js` files for malicious code.\n   - Check for **obfuscation** or **unusual API calls** in the scripts.\n\n3. **System Scans:**\n   - Run a full **antivirus\/malware scan** (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes) to detect potential threats.\n   - Monitor **network activity** for unusual outbound connections (e.g., C2 servers).\n\n4. **Update Software:**\n   - Ensure **Microsoft Office** and the **operating system** are up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the behavior could be **legitimate** (e.g., part of an Office update or AI Copilot feature), the **unusual volume of files** and **non-standard naming** warrant further investigation. If `SDXHelper.exe` is confirmed to be malicious or the files contain harmful code, immediate action (e.g., removal, system cleanup) is required."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're suspicious. All the entries are about files being created by the process SDXHelper.exe, and all the file paths are in the same directory under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The filenames all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash and .js extension.\n\nFirst, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of some software, maybe related to Office or other Microsoft products. But I'm not entirely sure. However, the fact that all these files are being created in the same directory might be normal if it's part of an update or installation process. But then again, malware often creates a lot of files in temporary or specific directories.\n\nLooking at the filenames, they all have a similar structure, which might be normal for resource files or language packs. However, the use of \"aicopilot\" in the name is a bit odd. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Like \"aircopilot\" or something else? Not sure. Alternatively, it could be a legitimate name if it's part of a specific application.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there are multiple entries with the same filename. For example, \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_6757e88a72ccfde2563faf78f31d8e9c.js\" appears twice. That might be normal if the process is creating the same file multiple times, but it could also indicate something like a loop or repeated attempts to write the file, which might be suspicious.\n\nHowever, without more context, like the system's usual behavior, other logs, or if there are any other processes involved, it's hard to tell. These events alone might not be malicious, but they could be part of a larger pattern. Since all the files are being created by the same process in a consistent location, and assuming SDXHelper is legitimate, this might be normal. But if SDXHelper isn't a known legitimate process, this could be a red flag.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that these files are part of a legitimate application's resources, such as localization files (.min might be minified JavaScript). However, the presence of so many files with similar names might be unusual. Maybe the application is generating a lot of language files, but that seems excessive.\n\nIn summary, without more information, it's a bit ambiguous. The events could be normal if SDXHelper is legitimate and the files are part of its operations. However, the repetitive filenames and the specific naming convention might warrant further investigation, such as checking the process's reputation, verifying the files' contents, or looking for other suspicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the creation of multiple JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) by the process `SDXHelper.exe` in a specific directory under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. Here's an analysis of potential concerns and next steps:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process Legitimacy**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a widely recognized Microsoft Office component. It may be part of third-party software, a driver, or a legitimate application. However, its absence from standard Microsoft tools raises initial suspicion.\n\n2. **File Naming and Structure**:\n   - The filenames (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) suggest they could be **minified JavaScript resources** (e.g., localization files or application components). However, the repetitive naming and hash-based suffixes are unusual for standard resource files, which might typically use more descriptive names (e.g., `en-US.js`, `fr-FR.js`).\n\n3. **Repetition of Files**:\n   - Some files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_6757e88a72ccfde2563faf78f31d8e9c.js`) are logged twice. This could indicate:\n     - **Normal behavior** (e.g., retries during file creation).\n     - **Malicious activity** (e.g., attempting to overwrite or inject content).\n\n4. **Directory Context**:\n   - The files are created in a Microsoft Office-related directory (`SolutionPackages`). If `SDXHelper.exe` is not associated with Office, this could indicate **unauthorized activity** in a trusted system location.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks**\n- **Malware Involvement**: The repetitive file creation and opaque naming could suggest **malware** generating payloads or obfuscating its presence.\n- **Legitimate Software**: If `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate application (e.g., a third-party tool or add-in), the files might be **legitimate resources**. However, this would require confirmation of the process's origin.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (via properties or tools like **Process Explorer**).\n   - Search for the process name in **Windows Defender** or **antivirus databases** (e.g., VirusTotal).\n\n2. **Analyze File Contents**:\n   - Inspect the generated `.js` files for suspicious code (e.g., obfuscation, network requests, or references to external domains).\n\n3. **Check for Unusual Behavior**:\n   - Monitor system performance, network traffic, and registry changes during `SDXHelper.exe` execution.\n   - Look for **parent processes** or **related files** that might indicate a larger malicious payload.\n\n4. **Review System Context**:\n   - Determine if the user has installed non-Microsoft software that might use `SDXHelper.exe`.\n   - Check for recent updates or installations that could correlate with the file creation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the events could be **legitimate** (e.g., a third-party tool generating resources), the **unusual file naming**, **repetition**, and **non-standard process** warrant further investigation. If `SDXHelper.exe` is not a known, trusted component, the activity may indicate **malware** or **unauthorized software**. Immediate action (e.g., isolating the system, running a full antivirus scan) is recommended if there is any doubt about the process's legitimacy."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all indicating that the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the same directory under Microsoft Office's Resources\/OfflineFiles. The files all have names starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash and a .js extension.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, possibly related to the setup or updates. But I should verify that. If it's a legitimate Microsoft process, then creating these files might be part of normal operations, like updating language packs or other resources. However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files with similar names could also be a red flag for malware, especially if these files are not expected.\n\nLooking at the file names, they all seem to be JavaScript minified files. The naming convention with hashes might be used to uniquely identify different versions or language packs. But if these files are being created in a directory that's not typical for Office, that could be suspicious. However, the path mentioned is under \"OfflineFiles,\" which might be where Office stores temporary or cached files during installation or updates.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the number of files. There are quite a few entries here, each with slightly different hashes. If this is part of a legitimate update, it might be normal. But if the user hasn't performed any Office updates or installations recently, this could be unusual. Also, checking if these files are actually being used by Office or if they're just being created without purpose could help determine if they're malicious.\n\nI should also check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate file. The location of the executable matters. If it's in the Windows System32 directory or another trusted location, that's more likely legitimate. If it's in a user's temporary folder or an unusual directory, that's a warning sign.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that all the files are created by the same process might indicate that the process is generating these files dynamically. If the files are not part of any known Office update or installation package, that's suspicious. It's also possible that the hashes are obfuscation techniques used by malware to avoid detection.\n\nAnother angle is to check for any other processes or activities happening at the same time. Are there any other suspicious processes running? Is there network activity that might indicate communication with a C2 server? However, the logs provided don't include that information, so I can't say for sure.\n\nIn summary, while the process name is legitimate, the repetitive creation of numerous files with similar names in a specific directory could be either a normal part of an update or a sign of malicious activity. Further investigation into the legitimacy of the files, their contents, and the context of their creation would be necessary to determine if they're harmful.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Log Entries:**\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the process `SDXHelper.exe` is repeatedly creating JavaScript minified files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min*.js`) in the directory `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\resources\\OfflineFiles`. These files are named with unique hash-based suffixes, suggesting they may be versioned or language-specific resources.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n\n1. **Process Legitimacy:**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate component of **Microsoft Office**, typically involved in **setup, updates, or resource management**. It is usually located in trusted system directories (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\`).\n\n2. **File Naming and Purpose:**\n   - The filenames (`officeaicopilot-strings.min*.js`) resemble **localized resource files** (e.g., language packs or UI strings). The `.min` extension suggests **minified JavaScript**, which is common in software updates.\n   - The use of hash-based suffixes may indicate **versioning** or **unique identifiers** for different file variants.\n\n3. **Context of File Creation:**\n   - The `OfflineFiles` directory is a known location for **temporary or cached files** during Office installations or updates. This aligns with legitimate behavior if the system is undergoing an update or resource deployment.\n\n4. **Potential Red Flags:**\n   - **Repetition and Volume**: While creating multiple files is expected during updates, the sheer number of files (16 entries) and their uniform naming pattern could suggest **unusual activity**, especially if no recent Office updates or installations are recorded.\n   - **Absence of User Context**: If the user has not initiated an Office update or installation, the activity may be **unauthorized** or **malicious**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Verify Legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Check the **file path** of `SDXHelper.exe`. If it resides in a trusted location (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\...`), it is likely legitimate. If located in a user-specific or temporary directory, investigate further.\n\n2. **Scan for Malware:**\n   - Use **antivirus\/malware scanners** (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes) to scan the system for malicious activity, particularly focusing on the `OfflineFiles` directory.\n\n3. **Check for Recent Office Updates:**\n   - Confirm whether the user has recently performed **Office updates or installations**, which could explain the file creation.\n\n4. **Analyze File Contents:**\n   - If the files are accessible, inspect their contents for **obfuscation, unexpected code**, or references to external domains (e.g., via network requests). This could indicate malicious intent.\n\n5. **Monitor System Behavior:**\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **ProcDump** to track the behavior of `SDXHelper.exe` and ensure it is not interacting with suspicious networks or modifying system files.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe activity **could be legitimate** if tied to an ongoing Office update or resource deployment. However, the **repetitive nature** of the file creation and lack of clear user context warrant further investigation. **If no recent Office updates are detected**, the behavior may indicate **malware masquerading as a legitimate process**. Always ensure system security tools are up to date and perform thorough scans."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if there's anything suspicious going on. All the entries are about files being created by the SDXHelper.exe process in the Office installation directory. The files have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min_ followed by a bunch of hexadecimal characters. \n\nFirst, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of Microsoft's software, possibly related to Office or some other Microsoft product. But I should confirm that. Maybe it's a known legitimate process, but sometimes malware can masquerade as legitimate processes.\n\nNext, looking at the file names. They all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" and then have a hash-like suffix. The repetition of some files, like \"min_9482e537fc099e6121990c14d593ebbe.js\" appearing twice, might be normal if they're being created multiple times, but it's worth noting. However, if the same file is being created repeatedly in a short period, that could be a sign of something malicious, like a loop or trying to overwrite files.\n\nThe directory path is \"C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\OfficeClickToRun\\Office16\\Setup\\Install\\Files\". That seems like a standard path for Office installations. But I should check if that's a typical location for SDXHelper to create files. If it's part of the installation or update process, then it's legitimate. However, if the files are being created in a different location or if there are unexpected files, that's a red flag.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the volume of these files. There are 16 entries here, all from the same process. If this is part of a normal operation, there might be a reason for so many files. But if this is an unusual number, maybe it's part of a larger attack, like downloading components or payloads.\n\nAlso, looking at the file extensions: they're all .js (JavaScript) files. JavaScript files can be used for legitimate purposes, but they can also be used to execute malicious code if they're being run by an attacker. However, just having .js files isn't necessarily bad. The content of the files would matter, but since we don't have that here, we can't say for sure.\n\nI should also check if there are any known malware or suspicious activity associated with SDXHelper.exe. Maybe a quick search in threat intelligence databases or checking if any recent malware uses this process name. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother angle: the fact that all these files are being created by the same process might indicate that the process is generating a lot of files, which could be part of a data exfiltration attempt, or maybe it's a legitimate process that's just doing a lot of file operations as part of its function.\n\nAlso, the timestamps of the files. If all these files were created in a very short time frame, that could be suspicious. But again, without timestamps, I can't assess that.\n\nIn summary, the key points are:\n\n1. Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe.\n2. The nature and purpose of the files being created.\n3. The repetition of certain files.\n4. The directory path and whether it's a typical location.\n5. The number of files created.\n\nSince I don't have more information, like the process's digital signature, the files' contents, or the system's overall behavior, it's hard to definitively say if this is malicious. However, the fact that so many files are being created by a single process in a specific directory might warrant further investigation. Maybe checking the process's parent process, its command-line arguments, and verifying if the files are part of a known legitimate update or installation package.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of Log Entries:**\n\n1. **Process Legitimacy (SDXHelper.exe):**\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate Microsoft process associated with Office installation and updates. It is typically found in the `OfficeClickToRun` directory and is used for deploying Office components. However, malware can sometimes mimic legitimate processes. Further verification (e.g., checking digital signatures, parent process, or behavior) is needed to confirm legitimacy.\n\n2. **File Creation Patterns:**\n   - **File Names:** The files are named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`, with hexadecimal hashes. These could be part of a legitimate update process (e.g., resource files for Office), but the use of hashes may also be a tactic to obfuscate malicious payloads.\n   - **Repetition:** Some files (e.g., `min_9482e537fc099e6121990c14d593ebbe.js`) appear twice. While this could be normal during installation, repeated creation of identical files in a short timeframe may indicate tampering or malicious activity.\n\n3. **Directory Path:**\n   - The files are created in `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\OfficeClickToRun\\Office16\\Setup\\Install\\Files`, a standard location for Office updates. This aligns with legitimate behavior but should be cross-checked against known Microsoft update directories.\n\n4. **File Extensions (.js):**\n   - JavaScript files (.js) are common in legitimate software but can also be used to execute malicious code. Without inspecting the file contents, it is impossible to determine if they are benign or malicious.\n\n5. **Volume and Timing:**\n   - **16 files** created by the same process may be normal during an update, but the absence of timestamps makes it difficult to assess timing. A sudden surge in file creation could signal an attack.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- **Verify Process Legitimacy:** Confirm that `SDXHelper.exe` is signed by Microsoft and check its parent process. Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to analyze the process.\n- **Inspect Files:** Analyze the contents of the `.js` files using a sandbox or antivirus tool to detect malicious code.\n- **Monitor Behavior:** Check for unusual network activity, system performance issues, or unexpected changes to the registry or files.\n- **Update and Patch:** Ensure Office and the operating system are up to date, as attackers often exploit unpatched software.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the activity aligns with a legitimate Office update process, the lack of context (e.g., file contents, timestamps) and the repetition of files warrant further investigation. Users should remain cautious and verify the process's legitimacy through additional checks."}

However, the lack of any other processes or events related to these files might indicate something's off.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are duplicates (like min_e4d9... appearing twice) might not be a big deal if they're just being created multiple times, but if they're part of a larger malicious payload, that could be a problem. But without more context, like network activity or other processes, it's hard to tell.\n\nHmm, but considering the directory path and the nature of the files, it's possible that this is related to a malicious software trying to inject or modify Office applications. However, I should also consider that maybe it's a legitimate application that's not well-known. \n\nIn the absence of more information, the safest bet is to flag this as suspicious. The combination of the process name, the directory, and the type of files created could indicate a potential security threat. But I should also mention that further investigation is needed, like checking the digital signatures of the files, looking at the system's overall behavior, and maybe running a malware scan.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Log Entries:**\n\nThe provided logs indicate repeated creation of JavaScript minified files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the Microsoft Office resources directory (`%LocalAppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\...`) by the process `SDXHelper.exe`. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process Involvement:**\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is not a standard Microsoft Office process. While it may be associated with legitimate software (e.g., third-party tools or plugins), it is also commonly linked to **malware** (e.g., **CoinMiner**, **Ryuk ransomware**, or **adware**).\n\n2. **File Behavior:**\n   - **JavaScript minified files** are typically used in web applications or browser extensions. Their presence in the **Office resources directory** is **unusual** and may indicate **tampering** or **injection** into Office processes.\n   - The **repetition of file creation** (e.g., `min_e4d9...` appearing twice) could suggest **packaging or obfuscation** of malicious code.\n\n3. **Directory Path:**\n   - The files are created in `%LocalAppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\...`, which is **not a standard location** for user-generated JavaScript files. This could indicate **malicious activity** (e.g., **DLL hijacking**, **macro injection**, or **exploitation** of Office vulnerabilities).\n\n4. **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - **Unusual file creation** in sensitive directories.\n   - **Suspicious process name** (`SDXHelper.exe`) with no clear association to legitimate Office operations.\n   - **Lack of user interaction** or context (e.g., no logs of user-initiated downloads or installations).\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **High Suspicion of Malware:** The combination of:\n  - Unusual file creation in Office directories.\n  - Use of `SDXHelper.exe` (a known malicious process).\n  - JavaScript files (potential payload delivery).\n  - Repeated file creation (possible obfuscation or evasion).\n- **Potential Threats:**\n  - **Malware execution** (e.g., crypto-mining, data exfiltration).\n  - **Office exploitation** (e.g., macro-based attacks).\n  - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., registry modifications, scheduled tasks).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Immediate Action:**\n   - **Isolate the system** if this activity is detected in a production environment.\n   - **Run a full malware scan** using updated antivirus\/EDR tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes).\n   - **Check for process injection** (e.g., using `Process Explorer` or `Procmon`).\n\n2. **Investigation Steps:**\n   - **Analyze the files** (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) for malicious content (e.g., using VirusTotal, YARA rules, or static analysis).\n   - **Check the digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (if present) and verify its legitimacy.\n   - **Review system logs** for related events (e.g., registry changes, network activity, or user account activity).\n\n3. **Preventive Measures:**\n   - **Restrict file creation** in sensitive directories (e.g., via AppLocker or Group Policy).\n   - **Monitor for unusual process behavior** (e.g., using SIEM tools or EDR).\n   - **Educate users** about phishing and suspicious downloads.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe activity described is **highly suspicious** and likely **malicious**. It warrants immediate investigation and mitigation to prevent potential data breaches, system compromise, or lateral movement within a network. Further analysis of the files and processes is critical to confirm the threat and scope."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's SDXHelper.exe and chrome.exe. SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames are officeaicopilot-strings.min with various hashes. That seems a bit odd because Office usually doesn't generate JavaScript files with those names in that location. Also, the same file is being created multiple times with different hashes, which might indicate some kind of injection or modification.\n\nThen there's chrome.exe handling a file named Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. The events show file creation and stream creation for this Excel file, including the Zone.Identifier, which is typically used by Windows to track where a file was downloaded from. But the fact that chrome.exe is creating streams and the file is being accessed multiple times might be normal if it's just a regular download. However, the repeated creation of the same file with different hashes by SDXHelper.exe could be a red flag.\n\nAnother point is the EXCEL.EXE process being created with the command line pointing to the downloaded Excel file. That's a normal activity if someone is opening the file, but combined with the other events, it might be part of a larger pattern. The presence of multiple JavaScript files created by SDXHelper.exe in a Microsoft Office directory could suggest that something is trying to inject or modify Office's resources, possibly for malicious purposes like a macro or exploit.\n\nI should also check for any suspicious file paths or process names. SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process, and its activity in the Office directories is unusual. The repeated creation of files with different hashes might be an attempt to overwrite or inject malicious code. The Zone.Identifier part is normal for downloaded files, but if the file was downloaded from an untrusted source, that's a concern. However, the events don't mention the source, so that's an unknown variable.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of non-standard processes creating multiple files in sensitive directories, along with the normal Excel process opening a downloaded file, might indicate a potential security issue. The JavaScript files created by SDXHelper.exe could be part of a malicious payload. However, without more context, like the source of the Excel file or further malicious activity, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the unusual behavior of SDXHelper.exe and the repeated file creation, this seems worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **suspicious behavior** that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **Unusual File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Multiple JavaScript files** (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`) are created in the **Microsoft Office directory** (`C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...`). \n   - These files are named with unique hashes (e.g., `min_fed6f639486874dd9ba20993e56de4b2.js`), suggesting **dynamic generation** rather than standard Office resources. \n   - **Repetition of file creation** (same file names with different hashes) raises concerns about **injection, tampering, or malicious payload delivery**.\n\n2. **`SDXHelper.exe` as a Non-Standard Process:**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is not a known legitimate Microsoft process. Its activity in the Office directory and creation of non-standard files may indicate **malware or a compromised system**.\n\n3. **`chrome.exe` and `EXCEL.EXE` Interaction:**\n   - The Excel file (`Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) is downloaded and opened, which is normal. However, the **repeated file stream creation** by `chrome.exe` and the **absence of clear user intent** (e.g., no explicit user action logged) could hint at **automated or malicious behavior**.\n\n4. **Lack of Contextual Clues:**\n   - No evidence of **user interaction** (e.g., manual download, macro activation) is explicitly logged.\n   - The **source of the Excel file** is not mentioned, leaving room for concern if it originated from an untrusted location.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Malware Injection:** The JavaScript files generated by `SDXHelper.exe` could be part of a **malicious payload** (e.g., embedded macros, exploit code).\n- **Office Exploitation:** The presence of these files in the Office directory may indicate an attempt to **compromise Office's execution environment**.\n- **Persistence Mechanism:** Repeated file creation could be a **stealthy persistence technique** or part of **data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Analyze the Excel File:**\n   - Check for **embedded macros**, hidden payloads, or connections to external URLs.\n   - Use tools like **VirusTotal** or **Office Malware Scanner** for deeper inspection.\n\n2. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Verify if it is a legitimate process (e.g., check digital signatures, file reputation).\n   - Monitor its network activity for **C2 communication** or data exfiltration.\n\n3. **Check System Integrity:**\n   - Run a **full antivirus scan** and **memory analysis** for signs of compromise.\n   - Review Windows Event Logs for **unauthorized access** or process anomalies.\n\n4. **User Education:**\n   - Ensure users are cautious about opening **untrusted Excel files** or enabling macros.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of events is **highly suspicious** due to the unusual behavior of `SDXHelper.exe` and the potential for **malicious activity** involving the Excel file. Further investigation is **critical** to confirm whether this is a false positive, a benign anomaly, or a genuine security threat. \n\n**Verdict:** ðŸš¨ **Investigate Immediately**."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first entry: SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. Then, EXCEL.EXE is loading several system DLLs like mscoree.dll, coml2.dll, and combase.dll. That seems normal because Excel might need those for its operations. But then there's svchost.exe setting a registry value. Not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nLooking further, SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple JavaScript files in the same directory, with different language codes in the filenames, like af-za, am-et, ar-sa, etc. That's a lot of files. Maybe it's part of a legitimate Office update or localization, but creating so many files with similar names might be a red flag. Also, some files are duplicated, like ar-sa-ui-strings-json appearing twice. Could be a mistake or intentional.\n\nThen there's EXCEL.EXE creating a file stream in a temporary directory, which is normal for processing Excel files. But the Zone.Identifier part might indicate a downloaded file, which could be a security risk if it's from an untrusted source. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe repeated creation of JavaScript files by SDXHelper.exe in the Office folder is concerning. Typically, such files might be part of add-ins or macros, but if they're being generated in bulk, it could indicate malicious activity. Also, the fact that these files are in the SolutionPackages directory, which is used by Office for add-ins, might be a point of interest. However, if the user has legitimate add-ins, this might be normal. But without knowing the user's environment, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thing is that SDXHelper.exe is a known process related to Office, but if it's creating a lot of files in a short time, that might be unusual. Also, the registry change by svchost.exe could be part of a legitimate system update, but it's worth checking.\n\nOverall, the main suspicious points are the large number of JavaScript files created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office directory, possibly indicating an attempt to inject malicious code or a large-scale modification. However, without more context like the user's system state, recent activities, or known good\/bad indicators, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the volume and the location, it's worth flagging for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation, though they may not definitively indicate malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Location:** Files are created in `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`.\n   - **File Types:** Multiple JavaScript (`*.js`) files with language-specific codes (e.g., `af-za`, `am-et`, `ar-sa`, etc.) in their names.\n   - **Duplicates:** Some files (e.g., `as-in-ui-strings-json_07b3b1cb7e3b3b51784f64d66647a936.js`) are created multiple times.\n   - **Implication:** While `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate Office process (related to add-ins\/macros), the **high volume** of JavaScript files in a structured, localized pattern could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate Activity:** Part of an Office update or localization pack.\n     - **Suspicious Activity:** Potential for **malicious script injection** (e.g., if files contain obfuscated code or are linked to external resources).\n\n2. **`EXCEL.EXE` Interactions:**\n   - **DLL Loads:** Loading system DLLs (`mscoree.dll`, `coml2.dll`, etc.) is normal for Excel.\n   - **File Stream Creation:** A temporary Excel file (`1680A406.xlsx`) is created with a `Zone.Identifier` stream, which typically marks files as downloaded from the internet. This could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate:** User opened a downloaded Excel file.\n     - **Suspicious:** If the file is untrusted or contains embedded macros.\n\n3. **Registry Modification by `svchost.exe`:**\n   - A registry change is logged, but without specific details (e.g., key\/path), it is hard to assess. This could be part of a **system update** or a **malicious configuration change**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks:**\n- **Malicious Scripting:** The JavaScript files could be **exploit payloads** or **malware droppers**, especially if they:\n  - Reference external URLs.\n  - Contain obfuscated code.\n  - Are not signed by Microsoft.\n- **Persistence or Data Exfiltration:** If the files are part of a larger attack chain, they might be used for **data extraction** or **command-and-control communication**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Analyze the JavaScript Files:**\n   - Check file contents for obfuscation, external URLs, or suspicious code.\n   - Verify digital signatures (if any) and compare hashes against known-good databases (e.g., VirusTotal).\n\n2. **Monitor `SDXHelper.exe` Behavior:**\n   - Use process monitoring tools (e.g., Sysinternals Process Monitor) to track file access, network activity, and registry changes.\n\n3. **Check for Unusual Office Add-ins:**\n   - Review installed Office add-ins and macros for unexpected or untrusted sources.\n\n4. **Investigate the Excel File:**\n   - Analyze `1680A406.xlsx` for embedded macros, hidden data, or malicious content.\n\n5. **Correlate with System Logs:**\n   - Look for other anomalies (e.g., unexpected network connections, unauthorized user activity) around the same timeframe.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the activity could be **legitimate** (e.g., a bulk Office update), the **repetitive nature** of the JavaScript file creation and the presence of a `Zone.Identifier` flag merit **closer scrutiny**. Further analysis of the files and system context is required to determine if this represents a **security threat**."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The file names are JavaScript files with hashes in them. Then there are entries from EXCEL.EXE creating a .LNK file in the Recent folder and several registry value set events. There's also an entry with no process and task \"None\".\n\nFirst, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I know, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, specifically related to the Office Add-ins or Solution Packages. So creating files in the SolutionPackages directory might be normal, especially if they're part of an add-in or language pack. However, the presence of multiple files with similar naming patterns and hashes might be a red flag. But then again, those could just be different resources or translations.\n\nThe EXCEL.EXE creating a .LNK file in the Recent folder is normal behavior when you open a file, as Excel creates a shortcut there. The registry events might be part of normal operations, but having so many of them (14 entries) could indicate something unusual. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe the user was interacting with Excel a lot, or there's an add-in causing multiple registry changes.\n\nThe entry with no process and task \"None\" might be an error or an incomplete log entry. That could be a sign of something wrong, but it's not clear yet.\n\nNow, considering the possibility of malicious activity. If SDXHelper.exe was being used to inject malicious code, the files created might have suspicious content. But the file names here are typical for Office resources. Also, the fact that the same files are being created multiple times (like the office_strings and taskpane files) might be normal if they're part of an update or installation.\n\nAnother angle: the presence of multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in the SolutionPackages folder. If these files are not part of a known Office package, that could be suspicious. However, since the user hasn't provided additional context, I can't confirm that. It's possible that the user is installing or updating an Office add-in, which would involve creating these files.\n\nThe registry changes by EXCEL.EXE could be part of normal operation, but if there's an excessive number, it might be worth looking into. However, without seeing the specific registry keys or values, it's hard to assess.\n\nPutting it all together, the logs show normal activities related to Office processes, but the high number of events and the presence of a log entry with no process might warrant further investigation. However, based solely on the information provided, it's not clear if there's a security threat. The files created by SDXHelper.exe are in legitimate directories, so unless there's other evidence, this might just be normal system behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events appears to involve normal system behavior related to Microsoft Office processes, but there are a few points warranting further investigation:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation:**\n   - **Legitimate Activity:** `SDXHelper.exe` is a known Microsoft Office process associated with add-ins or solution packages. The files created (e.g., `office_strings.js`, `taskpane.js`) are typical for Office resources, possibly part of language packs or add-ins.\n   - **Repetition of Files:** Some files (e.g., `office_strings_247f8f78dd7820085808b5e8fec39119.js`) are created twice. This could indicate redundancy in the process or a minor anomaly, but not necessarily malicious.\n\n2. **EXCEL.EXE and Registry Activity:**\n   - **.LNK File Creation:** The creation of a shortcut (`C:\\Users\\fidelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\Recent\\...`) is normal when opening files in Excel.\n   - **Registry Events:** 14 registry modifications by `EXCEL.EXE` are logged. While this could reflect normal operations (e.g., add-in configuration), excessive or unexplained registry changes might indicate tampering or malware.\n\n3. **Log Entry with No Process:**\n   - A single event with `process: null` and `task: \"None\"` could be an incomplete log entry or a potential indicator of an error. This requires further validation to rule out logging issues or hidden processes.\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Moderate Risk:** The activity aligns with typical Office operations, but the repetition of files and excessive registry events merit closer scrutiny. No direct evidence of malicious intent is present (e.g., suspicious file paths, unexpected processes, or network activity).\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for associated network activity, user behavior, or other process interactions to confirm legitimacy.\n- **Validate File Integrity:** Use tools like Microsoft Defender or antivirus to scan the created files for malware.\n- **Investigate Registry Changes:** Review the specific registry keys modified by `EXCEL.EXE` to ensure they are legitimate.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are likely benign but should be monitored. No immediate action is required unless additional suspicious activity is detected. **Further investigation is recommended to confirm normal behavior.** \n\n**Final Verdict:** **Interesting for further analysis** (but not definitively malicious)."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a list of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. First, I'll look through the entries to spot any patterns or anomalies.\n\nMost of the entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like \"en-us-ui-strings-json_...\" which seem to be language-specific UI string files. There are multiple entries for the same file paths, like \"vendor_6885c85796bd643fd6bc6d7029ad257e.js\" being created twice. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, typically involved in managing add-ins or solutions. Creating multiple instances of the same file might be normal during installation or updates. However, the repetition could also indicate something like a loop or an error in the process. \n\nBut wait, looking at the timestamps (though not provided here), if these events are spread out over a long period, it might be a problem. But since the user hasn't provided timestamps, I can't confirm that. Also, the file names include hashes, which are common in legitimate software for versioning. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of unexpected processes or other suspicious activities. The first entry is from EXCEL.EXE, which is normal. All other entries are from SDXHelper.exe, which is expected. No errors or warnings are mentioned. \n\nConsidering all this, unless there's a known issue with SDXHelper.exe creating duplicate files, this might just be part of a normal Office update or add-in installation. Without additional context like error messages or unusual process behavior, it's hard to flag this as malicious. Therefore, it's probably not interesting for investigation unless there's more evidence.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate normal activity related to Microsoft Office add-in or solution package management. Here's the analysis:\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **Process Context:** All events involve `SDXHelper.exe`, a legitimate component of Microsoft Office used for managing add-ins and solutions.\n2. **File Creation:** Multiple `.js` files (e.g., `vendor_6885c85796bd643fd6bc6d7029ad257e.js`) are created in the `SolutionPackages` directory. These files appear to be language-specific UI string resources (e.g., `en-us-ui-strings-json_...`), which are typical during Office updates or add-in installations.\n3. **Duplicates:** Some files (e.g., `vendor_6885c85796bd643fd6bc6d7029ad257e.js`) are logged twice. This could reflect redundant operations during installation\/updates but is not inherently suspicious without additional context (e.g., timestamps, errors).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe activity aligns with standard Office operations. No anomalies, errors, or indicators of compromise are present. **No further investigation is warranted** unless additional context (e.g., unexpected process behavior, timestamps, or errors) is available. \n\n**Classification:** False Positive (Benign Activity)."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there's a bunch of file creation events, all logged by the SDXHelper.exe process, except for one that's from winlogbeat.exe. The files are all in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory, and the names seem to be language-specific UI string files, like fr-ca-ui-strings-json, gd-gb-ui-strings-json, etc. \n\nFirst thought: SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, right? It might be involved in handling add-ins or solutions. The fact that so many files are being created in the SolutionPackages folder makes me think that maybe this is related to some kind of package installation or update. But why so many different language files? That could be part of a legitimate update that includes multiple languages, but it's also possible that this is part of a malicious activity, like dropping files for a payload.\n\nWait, but there's also an entry from winlogbeat.exe, which is a filebeat variant used for log collection. The file it created is a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. That might be part of a normal installation process, like configuring a new instance of winlogbeat. However, the presence of this file doesn't immediately raise red flags unless there's something suspicious about the path or the file name. But the name is typical for a configuration file.\n\nLooking back at the SDXHelper.exe events, all the files are in the same directory structure and seem to be part of the Office SolutionPackages. The repetition of the same directory path and the naming pattern (language codes followed by _ui-strings-json) suggests that these are resources for different locales. This could be a legitimate update or installation of an Office add-in that supports multiple languages. However, the sheer number of files and the fact that they're all being created by the same process might be worth investigating further. \n\nBut wait, are there any anomalies? For example, if these files weren't supposed to be created, or if there's a sudden spike in such activity. Since the user hasn't provided any context about the system's normal behavior, it's hard to say. However, the presence of multiple files with similar names and the same process could indicate that the process is being used to deploy a large number of files, which might be part of a larger operation, whether benign or malicious.\n\nAnother angle: the file names include hashes or unique identifiers. For example, the first file is \"fa-ir-ui-strings-json_3d61f61c855e898d507d755317807516.js\". The hash part might be a timestamp or a unique identifier for the version. That seems like a normal practice for versioning files. However, if the hashes don't correspond to any known legitimate files, that could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nBut without knowing the expected files, it's hard to tell. Also, the process SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process, so unless there's other suspicious activity (like network connections to unknown IPs, unexpected registry changes, etc.), these file creations might be part of normal operations.\n\nHowever, the fact that there's a mix of different language files and the repetition might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is using the SDXHelper.exe process to inject malicious code disguised as legitimate UI strings. But that's a bit of a stretch without more evidence.\n\nAlternatively, this could be a false positive. The user might be running a legitimate software update that's generating all these files. The key here is that the process is legitimate, and the files are in a legitimate directory. Unless there's other indicators of compromise, this might not be malicious.\n\nBut the presence of so many files being created in a short period could still be concerning. It's possible that the system is being used to host or distribute files, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nIn summary, while the events don't immediately point to a security threat, the volume and pattern of file creations warrant further investigation. Checking the integrity of the files, looking for any unexpected network activity, and verifying the legitimacy of the SDXHelper.exe process would be the next steps.\n<\/think>\n\nThe observed events involve multiple file creation activities primarily attributed to the **SDXHelper.exe** process, with one event from **winlogbeat.exe**. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process Involved**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe**: A legitimate Microsoft Office process, commonly associated with managing add-ins, solutions, or Office 365 deployments.\n   - **winlogbeat.exe**: A log collector (part of Elastic Stack), typically used for monitoring and shipping logs.\n\n2. **File Patterns**:\n   - **Language-Specific Files**: Files like `fr-ca-ui-strings-json_6a32ba787ffa131e75557ad2d0b9d81e.js` suggest localization resources (e.g., UI strings for different locales). This is consistent with legitimate updates or installations that support multilingual environments.\n   - **Hashed Filenames**: The inclusion of alphanumeric hashes (e.g., `3d61f61c855e898d507d755317807516`) may indicate versioning or unique identifiers, common in software updates.\n\n3. **Directory Context**:\n   - Files are stored in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`, a known directory for Office-related packages and add-ins.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimacy Assessment**\n- **SDXHelper.exe Activity**:\n  - **Likely Legitimate**: The process and directory are associated with Microsoft Office, and the file naming aligns with localization resources. This could be part of a **legitimate update**, **add-in deployment**, or **language pack installation**.\n  - **Red Flags**: The volume of files and repetitive patterns could indicate **unusual behavior** if not aligned with expected system activity (e.g., no recent Office updates or add-in installations).\n\n- **winlogbeat.exe Activity**:\n  - **Likely Legitimate**: The creation of a `.yml.new` file in `Downloads` is typical during configuration setup for log collection tools. No immediate suspicious indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Unusual Volume**: A large number of files being created in a short period may indicate **malicious activity** (e.g., file dropper, payload deployment) if not tied to a known legitimate process.\n- **Lack of Context**: Without additional data (e.g., system logs, network activity, user behavior), itâ€™s challenging to confirm legitimacy definitively.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Next Steps**\n1. **Correlate with System Logs**:\n   - Check for other events (e.g., registry changes, network connections) associated with **SDXHelper.exe** or **winlogbeat.exe**.\n   - Verify if the files are signed by Microsoft and match expected hashes.\n\n2. **Check for Recent Updates\/Installations**:\n   - Confirm if a legitimate Office update or add-in was recently installed, which could explain the file creation.\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Use EDR\/XDR tools to monitor **SDXHelper.exe** for unusual behavior (e.g., unexpected network requests, process injection).\n   - Analyze the contents of the created files (e.g., via sandboxing) to ensure they are not malicious.\n\n4. **Review winlogbeat Configuration**:\n   - Ensure the `.yml.new` file is part of a legitimate configuration and not tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity is **likely legitimate** if aligned with recent Office updates or add-in deployments. However, the **volume and repetitive patterns** warrant further investigation to rule out **malicious use of the SDXHelper.exe process**. No immediate threats are evident from the provided data, but contextual analysis is critical."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if this batch is interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, most of the logs are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The file names look like they're language-specific UI strings, like \"en-us-ui-strings.json\" or similar. That seems normal for localization files. But wait, there's a lot of them. Maybe that's just part of a regular update or installation?\n\nThen there's an entry where the process is null and the task is \"None\", which might be an error or incomplete log. Not sure yet. Also, there's a registry event from EXCEL.EXE. Setting a registry value isn't necessarily bad, but combined with the other logs, maybe there's something going on.\n\nWait, SDXHelper.exe is a known Microsoft process related to Office, right? So creating these files could be part of normal operations. However, the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times might be a red flag. Maybe it's a malicious process trying to inject files? But then again, if it's part of a legitimate update, that's normal.\n\nThe registry change by EXCEL.EXE could be related to some configuration change. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the combination of multiple file creations and a registry change might be worth investigating. Also, the presence of a log entry with process null might indicate some anomaly.\n\nBut I need to check if SDXHelper.exe is typically involved in creating so many files. If this is part of a legitimate process, like an Office update, then it's not suspicious. However, if the files are being created in unusual locations or with unusual names, that's a problem. Here, the path is within the Office SolutionPackages, which seems legitimate.\n\nAnother thing: the user mentioned that the files are \"ui-strings-json\" for various locales. That's probably normal for localization. So maybe this is just a normal activity. The registry change might be unrelated. But then why are there so many file creation events?\n\nWait, looking at the logs again, some entries have the same file path repeated. Like \"ka-ge-ui-strings-json\" appearing twice. Maybe that's just a log duplication error. Or maybe the process is creating the same file multiple times, which could be a sign of something wrong.\n\nHowever, without more information, it's hard to say. The presence of a registry event might be a separate issue. But considering that the majority of logs are from SDXHelper.exe creating localization files, which is a legitimate process, maybe this isn't suspicious. But the user is asking if it's interesting for investigation. So perhaps the answer is that it's not necessarily malicious, but the combination of multiple file creations and a registry change might warrant further inspection to confirm it's legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries provided involve a mix of legitimate and potentially noteworthy activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation**:\n   - The majority of logs show `SDXHelper.exe` creating files in the `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. These files (e.g., `xx-xx-ui-strings-json`) appear to be localization resources for Office applications. This is **normal behavior** for `SDXHelper.exe`, which is a legitimate Microsoft process involved in Office updates and installations.\n\n2. **Registry Change by EXCEL.EXE**:\n   - A single entry indicates a registry value set by `EXCEL.EXE`. This is a **common operation** during software configuration and does not inherently indicate malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Potentially Worth Investigating**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation**:\n   - Some files (e.g., `ka-ge-ui-strings-json`, `km-kh-ui-strings-json`) are logged multiple times. While this could be due to logging duplication or normal update processes, **redundant file creation** might warrant further inspection to rule out anomalies (e.g., malicious scripts or loops).\n\n2. **Null Process Entry**:\n   - One log entry has `process: null` and `task: None`, which could indicate **incomplete or corrupted data**. This might be a logging artifact, but itâ€™s worth verifying if other entries with similar patterns exist.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Not Immediately Suspicious**: The majority of logs align with legitimate Office operations. `SDXHelper.exe` and `EXCEL.EXE` are trusted processes, and the file paths and names are consistent with localization updates.\n- **Recommendation for Further Investigation**:\n  - Check if the repetitive file creation is part of a known update or if it correlates with unusual system behavior.\n  - Investigate the null process entry to ensure itâ€™s a logging error and not a sign of unauthorized activity.\n  - Monitor for additional registry changes or unexpected process interactions that could indicate a broader issue.\n\n**Final Verdict**: The logs are **not clearly malicious**, but the repetitive file creation and null entry merit closer scrutiny to confirm legitimacy."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are a lot of entries where the process is EXCEL.EXE and the task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". There are seven of those. Then, there are several entries involving SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific directories under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The files have names that look like language-specific UI strings, like \"kok-in-ui-strings-json_e7dfbea71abb6781ead8c8671a96a5eb.js\" and similar ones. Some of these files are created multiple times, like the \"lo-la-ui-strings-json\" file appears twice.\n\nNow, thinking about potential threats. Excel is a common application, but if it's modifying registry values repeatedly, that might be suspicious. However, Excel can legitimately modify the registry during normal operations, like when adding add-ins or changing settings. But the number of events here might be a red flag. However, the main concern here might be the SDXHelper.exe process creating a lot of files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office Add-ins, specifically the \"Office Add-in\" development tools. So, if this process is creating numerous files, especially with unique hashes in their filenames, that could indicate that someone is deploying custom add-ins or possibly malicious code.\n\nBut wait, the filenames have parts like \"en-us_web_taskpane.js\" which sounds like a legitimate Office Add-in file. However, the repetition of certain files and the presence of many different language-specific files might be unusual. Also, the mix of registry changes by Excel and file creation by SDXHelper could be part of a larger operation. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious or just a user deploying a lot of add-ins.\n\nAnother angle: the filenames have unique identifiers (like e7dfbea71abb6781ead8c8671a96a5eb), which might be hashes or unique IDs. This could be normal for add-ins, but if these are being created in large numbers, it might indicate a deployment of multiple add-ins, which could be legitimate or not. Also, the fact that some files are created multiple times (like the \"lo-la\" and \"lv-lv\" files) might be due to updates or errors.\n\nHowever, considering that SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, and the files are in the expected directory, this might not be malicious. But the combination with the Excel registry changes could be part of a larger issue. Maybe the user is working on a project that involves a lot of add-ins, leading to these logs. But since the user hasn't provided more context, I have to base my judgment on the logs alone.\n\nIn threat hunting, a high number of file creations in sensitive directories by a helper process, along with registry modifications by a common application, might be worth investigating further. It's not a clear-cut malicious activity, but it's unusual enough that it could indicate something worth looking into, like a potential compromise or a misconfigured add-in deployment.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show a mix of **normal Office-related activity** and **potentially suspicious behavior** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Legitimate Activity**\n- **`SDXHelper.exe` creating files in `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`**:\n  - **Context**: `SDXHelper.exe` is associated with **Microsoft Office Add-ins** (e.g., for deploying or debugging add-ins). The files (e.g., `taskpane.js`, `ui-strings-json_...`) resemble **language-specific UI resources** for Office add-ins.\n  - **Legitimacy**: This is **expected** during development or deployment of Office add-ins, especially if the user is working on a multilingual or complex add-in project.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potentially Suspicious Behavior**\n- **Repetition of file creation**:\n  - Some files (e.g., `lv-lv-ui-strings-json_07aa48624a0778bb5f2a77d657aaf34a.js`, `mk-mk-ui-strings-json_d5d84409d668d3caadfc252ff722f991.js`) are created **multiple times**. This could indicate:\n    - **Redundant deployments** (e.g., accidental reinstallation of the same add-in).\n    - **Malicious activity** (e.g., injecting multiple payloads or obfuscating malicious code via unique hashes in filenames).\n\n- **`EXCEL.EXE` modifying registry values**:\n  - **Context**: Excel can legitimately modify the registry during normal operations (e.g., adding add-ins, changing settings).\n  - **Suspiciousness**: **Seven repeated \"Registry value set\" events** by Excel are unusual. While not inherently malicious, this could indicate:\n    - **Automated scripting** (e.g., a macro or external tool modifying registry keys).\n    - **Potential exploitation** (e.g., a malicious macro attempting to persist changes).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n- **Unusual file naming patterns**:\n  - Filenames like `kok-in-ui-strings-json_e7dfbea71abb6781ead8c8671a96a5eb.js` contain **hash-like suffixes** (e.g., `e7dfbea71abb6781ead8c8671a96a5eb`). This is common in **malware or obfuscated payloads**, though not definitive proof here.\n- **High volume of activity**:\n  - The combination of **multiple file creations** and **registry modifications** could indicate **coordinated activity** (e.g., a script deploying an add-in while modifying system settings).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the source of the files**:\n   - Check the **origin** of the files in `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` (e.g., are they from a trusted developer?).\n   - Analyze the **content** of the `.js` files for obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n2. **Monitor Excel activity**:\n   - Check for **unusual macros**, **external connections**, or **unauthorized add-ins** in Excel.\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals** to trace registry modifications.\n\n3. **Check for lateral movement**:\n   - Ensure no other processes are interacting with the same files or registry keys in an unexpected way.\n\n4. **Verify user intent**:\n   - If the user is a developer, this activity may be legitimate. If not, it could indicate **compromise** or **misconfiguration**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs are **not definitively malicious**, the combination of **repeated file creation by `SDXHelper.exe`**, **unusual filename patterns**, and **multiple registry modifications by Excel** raises **low-to-moderate risk**. Further investigation is recommended to rule out **malicious activity** or **misconfigured add-ins**."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all showing that the SDXHelper.exe process is creating files in the OfflineFiles directory under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files have names like ml-in-ui-strings-json, mr-in-ui-strings-json, and so on. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, right? It's involved in managing solutions and add-ins. Creating files in the OfflineFiles folder might be part of its normal operations, especially if it's handling language packs or UI strings for different locales. The filenames include language codes (like ml, mr, ms-my, etc.), which suggests they might be localization files.\n\nBut why are there so many duplicates? Some files are listed twice, like ml-in-ui-strings-json and ms-my-ui-strings-json. Maybe that's just a coincidence in the log entries, or maybe there's a loop or repeated action. However, the process is the same each time, and the task is FileCreate. \n\nNow, considering security aspects. Malicious activity often involves unexpected file creation, especially in unusual directories. However, the path here is within the AppData Local folder for Microsoft Office, which is a legitimate location for such files. The process is SDXHelper.exe, which is a known legitimate process. \n\nBut wait, could there be a possibility of a legitimate process being abused? For example, if SDXHelper.exe is being used to drop malicious files. However, the filenames here are typical for UI strings, which are part of normal operations. The hashes in the filenames might be checksums or version identifiers, which is common in software distribution.\n\nAnother angle: the repetition of the same file creation events. If this were a malicious process, you might see a pattern of creating multiple files rapidly or in different directories. But here, all the files are in the same directory, and the process is consistent. \n\nSo, putting it all together. The events seem to be part of a legitimate process, possibly related to updating or installing language packs or UI resources for Office. The duplication in log entries might be due to multiple events being logged for the same file creation, perhaps during a package installation. Since there's no indication of unusual processes, unexpected network activity, or other signs of compromise, this might not be a security incident. \n\nHowever, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is known to create such files. A quick recall: SDXHelper.exe is associated with the Office Deployment Tool and is used for installing and managing Office solutions. Creating these JSON files for UI strings could be part of that process, especially when deploying different language versions. \n\nTherefore, the classification here is likely \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activity aligns with the expected behavior of a legitimate process. The confidence is high because the process, file paths, and actions are all consistent with normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show SDXHelper.exe creating localized UI string files in a legitimate Microsoft Office directory. This aligns with normal Office deployment behavior, and no suspicious patterns (e.g., unusual file types, unexpected paths, or non-standard process behavior) are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
