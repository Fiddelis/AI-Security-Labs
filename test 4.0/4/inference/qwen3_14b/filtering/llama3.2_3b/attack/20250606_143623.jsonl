The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's 'whoami.exe' which is normal, but then multiple 'powershell.exe' entries. PowerShell is often used by attackers, so that's a red flag. \n\nOne of the PowerShell commands stands out: it's creating a new service called 'objeto_ativo' with a binary path pointing to 'tarefa_logico.exe'. That doesn't look like a standard Windows file. The fact that a new service is being created via PowerShell might be malicious.\n\nThen, there are image loads of 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading .NET DLLs like clr.dll and clrjit.dll. That could be part of a .NET application, but combined with the service creation, it's suspicious. Also, the temporary files being created and deleted might be part of an attempt to execute scripts without leaving traces.\n\nThe 'services.exe' process modifying the registry multiple times could indicate changes to service configurations, which is another suspicious activity. The setup.exe creating files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory might be legitimate if it's part of an installation, but without context, it's hard to say. However, the combination of these events—especially the service creation, registry changes, and the use of PowerShell for potentially malicious tasks—suggests that this might be a compromise.\n\nI need to check if there's a pattern here.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is 'setup.exe' creating files. The paths mentioned are in the Microsoft Edge directories, like 'show_third_party_software_licenses.bat', 'Installer\\setup.exe', 'msedge.exe', 'msedge_proxy.exe', and 'pwahelper.exe'. Now, setup.exe is often used by installers, but creating executable files in the Program Files directory might be suspicious. Normally, legitimate software might install files there, but if it's creating executables that aren't part of a known installation, that could be a red flag.\n\nThen there are registry events related to svchost.exe and services.exe. svchost.exe is a standard Windows process that hosts various system services, but if it's modifying the registry, especially if it's adding or deleting objects, that might indicate something's wrong. However, svchost can be part of normal operations, so I need to check if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the files created by svchost.exe in the Windows Temp directory. Temporary files are common, but the names like 'APPX.eupxogogonk2uz72tg0nuo3qd.tmp' might be related to Windows updates or app installations. However, if there's a large number of such files or they're being created in unusual contexts, that could be concerning. But in this case, it's just a few entries.\n\nAnother point is the 'setup.exe' creating files in the Application directory of Microsoft Edge. If this is part of a legitimate update, maybe, but if the setup.exe is not from a trusted source, that's bad. However, the logs don't provide information about the source or hash of the executable, so I can't confirm that.\n\nAlso, there's a PowerShell command executed with restricted execution policy, which is the default. The command is simple: writing 'Final result: 1' to the host. That seems benign, but maybe it's part of a larger script that's not shown here. However, on its own, it's not suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious points are the multiple file creations by setup.exe in Microsoft Edge directories. Since setup.exe is often used for installations, but creating executables in Program Files might be part of a legitimate installation. However, if these files are not part of a known legitimate installation, or if there's an unusual number of such events, that could be a sign of malicious activity. However, without more context, like the source of setup.exe or other indicators of compromise, it's a bit tricky.\n\nBut considering that all the files are in Microsoft Edge directories and the process is setup.exe, which might be part of an installer, maybe it's a legitimate activity. However, the fact that setup.exe is creating multiple executables, including one named 'show_third_party_software_licenses.bat' which could be a script that's not part of the standard installation, might be suspicious. Also, the registry modifications by svchost.exe could be part of a larger attack, but again, without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nI think the key here is that the batch includes multiple file creations by setup.exe in what seems like a software installation path, but also some registry changes. However, since Microsoft Edge is a legitimate product, maybe this is part of an update. But the presence of setup.exe creating files in the Application directory might be a red flag. The confidence is moderate because there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation, but not conclusive proof of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries include several activities that warrant further investigation, though they are not definitively malicious. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **`setup.exe` Creating Executables in Microsoft Edge Directories**:\n   - **Files**: `show_third_party_software_licenses.bat`, `msedge.exe`, `msedge_proxy.exe`, `pwahelper.exe` in `Program Files\\Microsoft Edge`.\n   - **Concern**: While `setup.exe` is commonly used for installations, creating executable files (e.g., `msedge.exe`, `pwahelper.exe`) in the Application directory of a legitimate software (Microsoft Edge) is unusual. Legitimate installations typically do not overwrite or create binaries in such locations. This could indicate an **unauthorized modification** or **malware masquerading as a legitimate installer**.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications by `svchost.exe`**:\n   - **Activity**: Multiple `Registry value set` events linked to `svchost.exe` (a standard host process for Windows services).\n   - **Concern**: While `svchost.exe` is legitimate, **unusual registry changes** (e.g., adding\/deleting keys) could indicate **malicious persistence mechanisms** or **tampering with system behavior**. However, without context (e.g., specific registry keys modified), this is inconclusive.\n\n3. **`svchost.exe` Creating Temporary Files in `Windows\\Temp`**:\n   - **Files**: `APPX.*.tmp` files (common in Windows Update\/AppX package operations).\n   - **Concern**: These files are **typically benign** (e.g., part of system updates). However, **excessive or unusual creation** of such files might suggest **malware caching payloads** or **exploiting temporary directories**.\n\n4. **PowerShell Execution**:\n   - **Command**: `Write-Host 'Final result: 1'` with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`.\n   - **Concern**: The command itself is harmless, but **PowerShell is often abused** in attacks (e.g., for downloading payloads). The lack of context (e.g., script source, additional commands) makes this **low risk** but worth monitoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Possibilities**\n- **Microsoft Edge Updates**: The `setup.exe` activity could be part of a **legitimate Edge update or repair**, though this would typically involve more structured logging (e.g., via `msiexec` or `winget`).\n- **System Updates**: The `svchost.exe` and `APPX.*.tmp` files might be **part of a Windows update** or **AppX package installation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs show **potential indicators of compromise** (e.g., `setup.exe` creating suspicious files, `svchost.exe` registry changes) but lack definitive evidence of malicious intent. **Further investigation** is recommended, including:\n- **Analyzing the source** of `setup.exe` (e.g., hash, digital signature).\n- **Checking for additional logs** (e.g., network activity, user context).\n- **Cross-referencing with known good behavior** for Microsoft Edge updates.\n\n### **Risk Assessment**\n- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity**: Moderate (suspicious patterns, but no clear proof).\n- **Recommended Action**: **Investigate further** using endpoint detection tools, check for anomalies in system behavior, and verify the legitimacy of `setup.exe`.\n\n**Final Verdict**: **INTERESTING** – The logs contain suspicious activity that merits deeper analysis."}

The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several instances of Image loaded events pointing to various DLLs, some of which are part of the .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, clrjit.dll, and others. These are legitimate system files, so that's normal. But then there are some file creation events in the Windows Temp directory, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_ files. That might be suspicious because creating temporary files could be part of an attack, especially if they're named in a way that suggests testing or script execution.\n\nAnother event shows the execution of a PowerShell command that's checking INF files for specific patterns. The command line is a bit complex, but it's looking for defaultinstall sections in INF files. That might be part of a script that's trying to detect certain configurations, which could be benign or malicious. However, the presence of multiple file creations and the use of PowerShell with restricted execution policy might indicate something is trying to bypass security measures.\n\nThen there's the use of Dism.exe with the command to disable Windows Defender. That's a red flag because disabling security features is a common tactic in attacks. The Dism.exe events also mention executable files in the Temp directory, which could be part of a malicious payload being executed.\n\nPutting this all together: PowerShell is being used extensively, there are attempts to disable security software (Windows Defender), files are being created in temp directories (common in malware), and there's interaction with system files. Even though some DLLs are legitimate, the combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because disabling defender and creating suspicious files in temp are strong indicators of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes loading .NET DLLs, creating temporary files, and attempting to disable Windows Defender via Dism.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. The first event mentions a file created named DismHost.exe in the Temp directory. The subsequent events all indicate that various DLL files (like DismProv.dll, AssocProvider.dll.mui, etc.) have been detected as executable.\n\nHmm, Dism.exe is known to use temporary files during its operations, especially when dealing with system images or updates. However, the presence of multiple DLLs being created in the Temp folder might be normal, but I should check if there's anything suspicious here. The filenames like DismProv.dll and others with .mui extensions are typically part of the Windows Imaging and Deployment Components. \n\nWait, but why are they being flagged as executable? The FileExecutableDetected rule might be triggering because these files are being written to the Temp directory, which is a common place for malware to drop files. However, since Dism.exe is a legitimate process, it's possible that these files are part of a legitimate operation, such as applying an update or package. \n\nBut the fact that so many files are being created in the Temp directory under a unique GUID folder could be a red flag. Malware sometimes uses temporary directories to store malicious payloads. However, without additional context like process command-line arguments, parent processes, or network activity, it's hard to say for sure. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. On one hand, the process is legitimate, and the files might be part of normal Dism operations. On the other hand, the sheer number of files and their placement in Temp could indicate something malicious. But since all the files are associated with Dism and the process is legitimate, it's more likely a false positive or part of a legitimate system update. \n\nI think the justification would be that while the events are related to Dism.exe, which is legitimate, the creation of multiple executable files in the Temp directory might be normal during deployment tasks. However, the system should be monitored for any unusual behavior. Since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here, it's probably not a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events logged involve the legitimate Windows process **`Dism.exe`** (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool), which is commonly used for system imaging, deployment, and update operations. The files created in the **`Temp`** directory (e.g., `DismHost.exe`, `DismProv.dll`, and various `.mui` files) are associated with Windows Imaging and Deployment Components, which are part of the operating system's update and configuration processes.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Legitimate Process**: `Dism.exe` is a trusted Windows utility. Its use of temporary directories (e.g., `AppData\\Local\\Temp`) during operations (e.g., applying updates, imaging) is normal behavior.\n2. **File Creation Context**: The files listed (e.g., `.dll`, `.mui`) are typically part of system packages or language resources used by `Dism.exe` during deployment tasks. The `.mui` files, in particular, are language-specific resource files for Windows components.\n3. **No Immediate Malicious Indicators**: There is no evidence of anomalous behavior (e.g., network activity, unusual command-line arguments, or parent processes) that would suggest malware. The files are not flagged as malicious in this context.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe events are likely **part of a legitimate system update or deployment operation**. While the creation of multiple executable files in the `Temp` directory might raise a flag, this behavior is consistent with `Dism.exe`'s normal operations. No actionable threat is detected here.\n\n**Classification**: **Not a security threat** (likely legitimate system activity).  \n**Recommendation**: Monitor for unusual `Dism.exe` behavior (e.g., unexpected command-line arguments, network connections) but no immediate action is required based on the provided data."}

The main thing here is that multiple files are being detected as executable by the FileExecutableDetected rule. These files are in the Temp directory under a unique GUID folder, which is a common tactic for malware to store temporary files.\n\nLooking at the file names, they have extensions like .dll.mui and .dll. MUI files are usually language-specific resources, but seeing them in the Temp folder might be suspicious. Also, the fact that DismHost.exe is being created and loading various DLLs from the same Temp directory could indicate that something is trying to execute code from these files. \n\nHowever, Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. Sometimes, it's used in legitimate scenarios, but the presence of multiple executable files in the Temp folder might be a red flag. The GUID in the path is a common way for malware to obscure the file path, making it harder to detect. \n\nBut wait, the events don't show any obvious malicious activity beyond the detection of these files. The classification as \"interesting\" might be appropriate here because the system's security rules are flagging these files as executable, which isn't typical for a Temp directory.

Still, the high number of executable files in Temp is concerning and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate activity involving the **`Dism.exe`** and **`DismHost.exe`** processes, which are legitimate Windows tools used for deployment and imaging. However, the events raise **suspicion** due to the following patterns:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Abundance of Executable Files in Temp Directory**:\n   - Multiple `.dll` and `.dll.mui` files (e.g., `TransmogProvider.dll`, `VhdProvider.dll`) are flagged as executable by the **`FileExecutableDetected`** rule.\n   - These files are stored in a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`) under a **GUID-based folder**, a common tactic used by malware to obscure file paths.\n\n2. **Suspicious Process Behavior**:\n   - **`DismHost.exe`** is launched with a command line referencing the same GUID folder, suggesting it may be interacting with the files in the Temp directory.\n   - **`ImageLoad`** events indicate that DLLs (e.g., `DismCorePS.dll`) are being loaded from the same Temp directory, which is unusual for legitimate tools.\n\n3. **Potential for Abuse**:\n   - While **`Dism.exe`** and **`DismHost.exe`** are legitimate, their use in this context (loading multiple executable files from a Temp directory) could indicate **malicious repurposing** (e.g., droppers, loaders, or exploit kits).\n\n---\n\n### **Why This is Interesting (but Not Definitely Malicious):**\n- **Legitimate Use Case**: Windows Imaging and Deployment tools (e.g., `Dism.exe`) can temporarily generate files in the Temp directory during operations like sysprep or image mounting. However, **this is typically limited to a small number of files**, not dozens of `.dll`\/`.dll.mui` files.\n- **Red Flags**:\n  - **High Volume of Executable Files**: The presence of **14+ executable files** in a Temp directory is highly atypical for normal system operations.\n  - **GUID-Based Obfuscation**: The use of a GUID in the file path is a common technique used by malware to evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **network activity** (e.g., outbound connections) from `DismHost.exe` or related processes.\n   - Look for **unusual registry modifications** or **file persistence** mechanisms.\n\n2. **Analyze the Files**:\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender ATP**, **Malwarebytes**, or **SIEM** to scan the files in the Temp directory for malicious content.\n   - Check the **hashes** of the files against threat intelligence databases (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX).\n\n3. **Monitor User Activity**:\n   - Determine if the user (`fiddelis`) was performing legitimate imaging tasks or if this activity occurred during an **unauthorized session**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe events are **suspicious enough to warrant further investigation** but **not definitively malicious** without additional context. The **high number of executable files in a Temp directory** and **GUID-based obfuscation** are strong indicators of potential malicious activity. \n\n**Classification**: `Interesting` (likely benign but requires deeper analysis).  \n**Confidence**: **0.7** (moderate risk due to suspicious patterns).  \n\nFurther analysis is recommended to rule out exploitation or repurposing of legitimate tools."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that the process involved is DismHost.exe and Dism.exe. These are part of the Deployment Imaging Service and Management (DISM) tool, which is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing Windows images. But I should be cautious because sometimes malware can masquerade as legitimate processes.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple entries where DismHost.exe loads various DLL files from a temporary directory. The paths all start with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\... and have names like LogProvider.dll, CbsProvider.dll, etc. Loading DLLs from the Temp folder can be suspicious because legitimate applications usually load DLLs from their own directories or system directories, not from temporary folders. This might indicate that someone is injecting malicious code or using a temporary location to avoid detection.\n\nThen there's the part where Dism.exe deletes several files from the same Temp directory. The files include DismCore.dll, DismHost.exe, and various .mui files. Deleting these files after loading them could be an attempt to clean up evidence. If these files were legitimate, why delete them? It's possible that they were part of a legitimate process, but the combination of loading and then deleting might be suspicious.\n\nI should check if the files being loaded are known to be part of DISM. For example, CbsProvider.dll might be a legitimate component, but the fact that they're all in the Temp directory and being deleted afterward raises a red flag. Also, the fact that multiple DLLs are loaded from the same temp folder might indicate that the process is not standard.\n\nAnother point is the use of the Temp directory. Malware often uses temporary directories to store files temporarily to avoid leaving permanent traces. The deletion of files after use could be part of that strategy. However, DISM might also use temp files during operations, so I need to consider if this is a normal operation or not.\n\nLooking at the event types: Process terminated for DismHost.exe, and File Delete logged for Dism.exe. The sequence of events could be part of a normal DISM operation, but the specific files involved and their paths are not typical. I should check if these DLLs are part of standard DISM operations. If they are not, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the fact that Dism.exe is deleting files that were loaded by DismHost.exe might be a sign of something malicious. Maybe the files were used to execute code and then deleted to avoid detection. Alternatively, this could be part of a legitimate process, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nI need to consider the possibility that this is a false positive. DISM can sometimes generate temporary files, but the combination of multiple DLLs from Temp and subsequent deletions is more indicative of malicious activity. However, without more information, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the context and the typical behavior of legitimate processes, this seems suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit behavior that warrants further investigation due to potential security concerns. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Unusual DLL Loading from Temp Directory:**\n   - **DismHost.exe** repeatedly loads multiple DLLs (e.g., `CbsProvider.dll`, `LogProvider.dll`, `SetupPlatformProvider.dll`) from a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`). \n   - **Legitimate Behavior vs. Suspicion:** While DISM tools can use temporary files, **loading numerous DLLs from a user-specific Temp folder** (not system-wide or application-specific directories) is atypical and raises concerns about **DLL injection** or **malicious code execution**.\n\n2. **File Deletion After Use:**\n   - **Dism.exe** deletes the same DLLs and associated files (e.g., `CbsProvider.dll`, `DismCore.dll`, `.mui` files) after they are loaded. \n   - **Suspicious Pattern:** Post-use deletion of files from the Temp directory could indicate an attempt to **remove evidence** of transient operations, which is common in **malware** or **exploits**.\n\n3. **Process Termination:**\n   - **DismHost.exe** terminates after loading the DLLs, which could be part of a **staged attack** (e.g., a dropper or loader).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threat Indicators:**\n- **DLL Side-Loading:** The use of Temp directory DLLs might indicate **side-loading** (replacing legitimate DLLs with malicious ones) or **DLL hijacking**.\n- **Cleanup Behavior:** Deleting files post-execution is a red flag for **malware** attempting to avoid detection.\n- **Unusual File Paths:** The Temp directory is not a standard location for DISM operations, which typically use system or application-specific directories.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n1. **Check File Signatures:**\n   - Verify the **digital signatures** of the loaded DLLs (e.g., `CbsProvider.dll`, `LogProvider.dll`) to confirm they are legitimate Windows components or third-party tools.\n\n2. **Analyze Temp Directory Contents:**\n   - Examine the **files in the Temp directory** (e.g., `33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`) for anomalies (e.g., hidden files, unusual timestamps, or unexpected file types).\n\n3. **Monitor Parent Processes:**\n   - Investigate the **parent process** of `DismHost.exe` and `Dism.exe` to determine if they are being invoked by unexpected applications or scripts.\n\n4. **Check for Malware Indicators:**\n   - Use **endpoint detection tools** (e.g., antivirus, EDR) to scan the system for malware or suspicious activity linked to the Temp directory files.\n\n5. **Review System Logs:**\n   - Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., **Windows Event Viewer**, **SIEM**) for additional context (e.g., failed login attempts, network activity, or registry changes).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile `Dism.exe` and `DismHost.exe` are legitimate tools, the **combination of loading and deleting multiple DLLs from a Temp directory** suggests **potential malicious activity**. This behavior is inconsistent with standard DISM operations and warrants immediate investigation to rule out **malware, exploits, or insider threats**."}

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what's going on here. The user provided a bunch of JSON logs that look like they're from Windows Event Logs, specifically related to process creation and some PowerShell commands. The main question is probably about what's happening here and whether it's malicious.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the logs. The first entry has a \"winlog\" task of \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\" and a \"file\" of \"None\". The \"process\" field here is a complex JSON string that includes command_line details. The command_line is using PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\" and then starting that service. The other entries are similar, repeating the same command but with the \"winlog\" task as \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"file\" as \"None\".\n\nNow, looking at the command, creating a new service and starting it via PowerShell could be suspicious. The service name is \"objeto_ativo\", which might be a made-up name. The binary path is in \"C:\\unidade_logico...\", which doesn't look like a standard Windows directory. Usually, services are installed in more standard locations like Program Files or System32. The fact that it's using PowerShell to create and start the service could be a sign of someone trying to install a backdoor or a malicious service.\n\nI should check if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is a legitimate file. If it's not known or if there's no record of it being part of any standard software, that's a red flag. Also, the use of \"New-Service\" and \"Start-Service\" in PowerShell might be part of a script to persist access on the system. The repeated entries might indicate that the service was created multiple times, which could be an attempt to ensure it's running even if it's removed.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the lack of file information. The \"file\" field is \"None\" in some logs, which might mean that the event didn't capture the file details, or maybe the file wasn't present. However, the \"process\" field has the command_line, so the actual executable is in the path provided.\n\nThe user might be asking if this is a security threat. Based on the information, it's likely suspicious. The creation of a new service with a non-standard path and using PowerShell to do so is a common tactic in malware. The service could be a backdoor, and the executable might be malicious. The repeated entries could be part of a persistence mechanism or an attempt to evade detection by reinstalling the service if it's removed.\n\nI should also mention that the service name \"objeto_ativo\" might be a placeholder or a name chosen to avoid detection. The lack of legitimate software associated with that name and path increases the suspicion. The user should check the file's hash, analyze it with antivirus tools, and monitor the system for any unusual network activity or other signs of compromise.\n\nIn summary, the logs indicate a potentially malicious activity where a service is being created and started via PowerShell, pointing to a non-standard executable. Further investigation is needed to confirm if this is a legitimate action or part of a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs provided indicate a potentially **malicious activity** involving the creation and activation of a new Windows service via PowerShell. Here's a breakdown of the key points and implications:\n\n---\n\n### **1. PowerShell Command Analysis**\nThe `command_line` in the logs shows the execution of the following PowerShell script:\n```powershell\nNew-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"\n```\n- **`New-Service`**: Creates a new Windows service named **\"objeto_ativo\"** (likely a placeholder or obfuscated name) with the binary path pointing to **`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`**.\n- **`Start-Service`**: Immediately starts the newly created service.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Suspicious Indicators**\n- **Unusual File Path**:  \n  The binary path **`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`** is **not a standard Windows directory**. Legitimate services are typically installed in:\n  - `C:\\Program Files\\...`\n  - `C:\\Windows\\System32\\...`\n  - Or via Windows Installer (MSI) packages.\n\n- **Non-Standard Service Name**:  \n  The service name **\"objeto_ativo\"** (Portuguese for \"active object\") is not a well-known or standard service name. This could be a **custom or obfuscated name** to avoid detection.\n\n- **Persistence Mechanism**:  \n  Creating a service via PowerShell is a common technique for **malware persistence**. The service could be a **backdoor** or **malicious payload** that runs silently in the background.\n\n- **Repeated Logs**:  \n  The logs show multiple entries with the same command. This might indicate an **attempt to ensure the service is re-created** if removed (e.g., by antivirus tools or manual cleanup).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Potential Risks**\n- **Malware Installation**:  \n  The executable **`tarefa_logico.exe`** could be a **malicious payload** (e.g., a backdoor, keylogger, or ransomware component).\n- **Evasion of Detection**:  \n  Using PowerShell for service creation helps evade traditional signature-based detection.\n- **Persistence**:  \n  The service would run at system startup, allowing the attacker to maintain access even after a reboot.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommended Actions**\n1. **Check File Integrity**:\n   - Verify the **hash** of `tarefa_logico.exe` using tools like **Windows Defender**, **Malwarebytes**, or **VirusTotal**.\n   - Compare the hash with known good files (if available).\n\n2. **Analyze the Executable**:\n   - Use **sandboxing tools** (e.g., ANY.RUN, Hybrid-Analysis) to analyze the behavior of `tarefa_logico.exe`.\n   - Check for network connections, registry modifications, or file operations.\n\n3. **Remove the Service**:\n   - If the service is confirmed malicious, delete it using:\n     ```powershell\n     Remove-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"\n     ```\n   - Use **`Get-Service`** to confirm the service is removed.\n\n4. **System Hardening**:\n   - Restrict PowerShell usage (e.g., via Group Policy or registry settings).\n   - Enable **audit logging** for service creation and modification.\n\n5. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Use **SIEM tools** (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack) to monitor for similar PowerShell activity.\n   - Check for unexpected network traffic from the service.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\nThe logs strongly suggest **malicious activity** involving the installation of a **non-standard service** via PowerShell. The file **`tarefa_logico.exe`** should be treated as **highly suspicious** until proven otherwise. Immediate investigation and mitigation are critical to prevent further compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first two entries stand out because they involve creating a new service with PowerShell. The command line shows the use of New-Service with a binary path pointing to tarefa_logico.exe, and then starting that service. That's a red flag because creating and starting a service without proper authorization can be part of an attack. The other entries are mostly about running PowerShell commands with Restricted execution policy, which is the default. Some of them are just writing 'Final result: 1' or checking INF files for certain patterns.\n\nNow, the first two events are definitely suspicious. They're modifying the system by adding a new service, which is a common tactic in malware to persist after an attack. The other events, while they might be part of some testing or legitimate scripts, don't show the same level of malicious intent. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell commands could be part of a larger attack, but without more context like file changes or network activity, it's hard to say. But since the first two events are clear indicators of potentially malicious activity, the batch as a whole is interesting enough to warrant investigation. The confidence is high because creating a service is a strong indicator, even if other events are benign.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The first two events show PowerShell creating and starting a new service with a non-standard executable path (C:\\\\unidade_logico...\\\\tarefa_logico.exe), which is a common technique for persistence in malware.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All three entries are about PowerShell commands being executed. The command line is the same in each case, so I need to analyze what that command is doing.\n\nThe PowerShell script is checking for INF files in the Windows directory's inf folder. It's looking for sections that match [defaultinstall.nt followed by architecture types like amd64, arm, etc. The script sets a result variable to 1 if it finds such a section, otherwise 0. The purpose here seems to be scanning INF files for specific installation sections related to different architectures.\n\nNow, why would this be suspicious? Well, INF files are used in Windows for installing drivers and other system components. The command is searching for defaultinstall sections, which might indicate someone is looking for installation configurations. However, the fact that the same command is logged multiple times in the same process might be normal if it's part of a legitimate system check. But if this is happening repeatedly or in an unusual context, it could be part of a malicious activity, like looking for vulnerabilities or preparing for an exploit.\n\nWait, but the classification is based on the entire batch. All three events are identical. The winlog tasks are 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which might be part of normal system operations. However, the PowerShell command itself is scanning INF files for specific sections. This could be part of a legitimate diagnostic tool, but it's also a technique used by malware to find system-specific configurations. \n\nThe key here is whether this behavior is out of the ordinary. If there's no other context, like other suspicious activities or known malicious indicators, then it might not be enough to classify as interesting. However, since the same command is logged multiple times, maybe in different tasks, it could indicate an automated scan. But without more data, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nConsidering that the command is not obviously malicious, but the repetition and the nature of scanning system files might be worth investigating. So, I think the classification here should be \"INTERESTING\" with a moderate confidence, as it's a potential indicator of activity that could be benign or malicious, requiring further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The same PowerShell command is executed multiple times, scanning INF files for architecture-specific installation sections, which could indicate system reconnaissance or potential exploitation attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
