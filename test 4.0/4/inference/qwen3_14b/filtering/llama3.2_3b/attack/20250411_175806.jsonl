{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. The user provided a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to analyze them to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key is to look at all events together.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. The first event is cmd.exe running a command to add a registry entry under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. The command adds \"registro_auxiliar\" pointing to \"C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe\". That's a common technique for persistence, modifying the registry to run a program at startup.\n\nThe second event is reg.exe adding another entry in the same registry key, \"entrada_principal\" pointing to \"C:\\Path\\pacote_temporario.exe\". Again, this is about setting up persistence. The third event is reg.exe with a registry value set, which might be related to the previous entries.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe creating a file \"modulo_padrao.txt\" in the Downloads directory. The fourth event is about a process access by powershell, but no file involved. \n\nNow, considering all these together. The main red flags are the modifications to the registry's Run key, which is a classic sign of malware trying to maintain persistence. Both cmd.exe and reg.exe are being used to add these entries. The fact that two different executables are being added to the Run key suggests that the attacker is setting up multiple points of entry. \n\nThe creation of a file by powershell might be part of the attack, but without more context, it's not immediately suspicious. However, combined with the registry changes, it could indicate a broader malicious activity. \n\nThe confidence here is high because modifying the registry for persistence is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Even if the file creation isn't clearly harmful, the combination with the registry events makes this batch interesting. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications in the Run key (HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run) detected via cmd.exe and reg.exe, indicating potential persistence mechanism setup. Combined with PowerShell activity, this suggests possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
