The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity related to powershell.exe. That's common, but sometimes it can be a red flag if it's doing unusual things. Let me check the command lines. Oh, several entries have the same command line: running Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the TEMP directory. That script name sounds suspicious. Keystrokes could imply capturing keyboard input, which is often used in malware to steal sensitive information.\n\nThen, there are multiple instances of the same script path being accessed from different directories. That might be an attempt to obfuscate the source or to use different paths to avoid detection. Also, the fact that the script is being executed multiple times with similar parameters could indicate an automated process or persistence mechanism.\n\nI also notice some image loads from .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. Those are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them isn't necessarily bad. However, when combined with the PowerShell activity, it might be part of a larger payload or a way to execute code.\n\nAnother thing is the File Delete and File Create events. The deletion of a PowerShell script file might be an attempt to clean up after execution, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid leaving traces. The creation of files in the Temp directory, like key.log, could be where the stolen data is stored.\n\nThere's also an event where the process is None, but the file path points to another instance of Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That might be a log entry from a different source or a misfire, but it's still worth noting.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file is probably normal, as it's a log shipper. Similarly, svchost.exe creating a file related to Delivery Optimization is likely legitimate. But the repeated PowerShell activity with the keystroke script is more concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated execution of a keystroke-logging script from various paths, combined with file creation and deletion, suggests potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the overall pattern here points towards something that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in $env:TEMP\\\\key.log, combined with file creation\/deletion events and .NET assembly loads, suggests potential keystroke logging malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look at these logs. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a known tool for collecting Windows logs, so that's normal. The second event is powershell.exe creating a file called entrada_padrao.txt. PowerShell is common, but creating a file in Downloads might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nWait, but why is the user fiddelis involved? Maybe that's a red herring. The first file is a .yml.new file for winlogbeat, which could be part of a configuration update. The second file is a text file. Neither seems malicious. No signs of unusual activity here. The processes are legitimate, and the files are in standard locations. No errors or unexpected behaviors mentioned. So probably not interesting. Confidence around 0.2 since there's no clear malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Both events involve legitimate processes (winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe) creating files in user download directories, which is common behavior for software installation\/configuration.
