{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. The first one is about MpDefenderCoreService.exe with a network connection detected. That's part of Microsoft Defender, so maybe legitimate. Then there's whoami.exe, which is a standard tool for checking user context. The command line shows it's being run normally.\n\nNext, powershell.exe and cmd.exe appear multiple times. The cmd.exe entry has a command adding a user and adding someone to the Domain Admins group. The command line uses net user and net group with domain parameters. That looks suspicious because adding users to Domain Admins is a high-privilege action. The passwords here are \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and similar, which might be temporary but still risky if used in a real environment.\n\nAnother cmd.exe instance is using net1.exe, which I don't recognize. Maybe a typo or a malicious tool? The net.exe command is adding another user to Domain Admins. Multiple attempts to add users to Domain Admins could indicate someone trying to escalate privileges or set up backdoors.\n\nThere's also svchost.exe creating SRUtmp.log, which is a normal system log file. Winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file might be part of configuration changes, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the repeated use of cmd and powershell with domain admin modifications is a red flag.\n\nI need to check if these commands are part of legitimate administrative tasks. Adding users to Domain Admins is a sensitive action that should be monitored. The presence of multiple such commands in a short time might indicate unauthorized access or a compromised system. The use of net1.exe instead of standard net.exe could be a sign of malicious activity. \n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows suspicious activities related to modifying domain admin groups and potential use of non-standard tools. The confidence is around 0.75 because while some events are normal, the combination of adding domain admins and unusual executables suggests a possible security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin users via 'net user' and 'net group' commands, use of non-standard executables (net1.exe), and repeated process access events for PowerShell and cmd.exe which are commonly abused for privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
