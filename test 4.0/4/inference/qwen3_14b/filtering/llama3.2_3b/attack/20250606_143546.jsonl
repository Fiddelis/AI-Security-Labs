The user provided a bunch of system events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if they're interesting enough for investigation. So, first, I should look through all the events to see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. One entry has a PowerShell command that imports a module from a path that looks a bit odd: \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The use of \"..\" in the path might indicate that it's navigating up directories, which could be a red flag. Also, the command line includes Invoke-entrada_principal and Start-Sleep, which might be part of a script trying to do something sneaky.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. Loading standard DLLs isn't necessarily bad, but the combination with other events might be suspicious. Also, the PipeCreated event for PowerShell could be part of inter-process communication, which might be normal but could also be used by malware.\n\nOther processes like whoami.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are legitimate, but svchost.exe creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory is interesting. SoftwareDistribution is related to Windows Update, so creating files there might be part of a legitimate update process, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something else. However, the filenames like UpdateAgent.dll, dpx.dll, and Mitigation.dll might be part of a legitimate update, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe key points here are the PowerShell script with the suspicious path and the multiple ImageLoad events. The presence of a command that seems to be executing a script from a non-standard location, along with the loading of various DLLs, could indicate an attempt to run malicious code. The use of \"Invoke-entrada_principal\" (which might be a typo or a custom function name) and the error handling with exit codes could be part of a malicious payload.\n\nHowever, there's not enough information to confirm this definitively. The events could be part of a legitimate script or a false positive. But given the combination of the suspicious command line and the multiple PowerShell-related events, it's worth flagging for further investigation. The confidence isn't 100%, but there's enough to consider it interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events with suspicious command-line arguments (e.g., importing a module from a non-standard path with '..' directory traversal) and loading of .NET-related DLLs, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where 'svchost.exe' is creating files in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory. The files mentioned are wcp.dll, TurboStack.dll, and fvereseal.dll. Hmm, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but creating multiple DLLs in that folder might be suspicious. The SoftwareDistribution folder is related to Windows Update, so maybe these files are part of an update? But the names like TurboStack.dll don't ring a bell as standard Windows components. I should note that.\n\nThen there's an entry where msedgewebview2.exe loads BitsProxy.dll from System32. That seems normal because BitsProxy is part of the Background Intelligent Transfer Service, which is used by Windows Update. But svchost.exe also loads the same DLL. Not sure if that's a problem yet.\n\nNext, there are several registry value set events by svchost.exe. Changing registry values can be a red flag, but again, svchost.exe is a host process for various services, so it's possible that legitimate services are modifying the registry. However, multiple registry changes without clear context might be concerning.\n\nLooking at the MpSigStub.exe entries, which is related to Windows Defender. It's creating temporary files in the Windows Temp directory. That seems normal for update processes. However, the filenames like mpasdlta.vdm and mpavdlta.vdm might be part of signature updates. But again, I need to check if these are standard or not.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory, like ie_to_edge_stub.exe and cookie_exporter.exe. Setup.exe is often used during installations, but the presence of these files under EdgeCore might be part of a legitimate Edge update. However, I should check if these are known files or if they're suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple file creations in Windows Update directories, some unusual DLL names, registry changes by svchost.exe, and setup.exe creating files in EdgeCore. The key here is whether these activities are part of a legitimate update or if they deviate from normal behavior. Since some of the filenames don't match standard components, and svchost.exe is involved in creating multiple files, this might indicate a potential issue. However, without more context like timestamps, user actions, or other security events, it's a bit hard to tell. But given the presence of multiple suspicious file creations and registry changes by a host process, I think this warrants further investigation. So, I would lean towards classifying this as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events presents several indicators that warrant further investigation, though they may not definitively point to malicious activity. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns**\n1. **Unusual File Creations by `svchost.exe`**:\n   - Multiple DLLs (`wcp.dll`, `TurboStack.dll`, `fvereseal.dll`) are created in the **`SoftwareDistribution\\Download`** directory, which is typically used by Windows Update. While legitimate updates can generate files here, **`TurboStack.dll`** and **`fvereseal.dll`** are not standard Windows components and may indicate unauthorized or tampered updates.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications by `svchost.exe`**:\n   - Multiple **registry value set** events are logged without clear context. While `svchost.exe` hosts many services, **unusual or frequent registry changes** could signal tampering, especially if tied to unexpected service behavior.\n\n3. **`MpSigStub.exe` and Temporary Files**:\n   - **`MpSigStub.exe`** (associated with Windows Defender) creates temporary files (e.g., `mpasdlta.vdm`, `mpavdlta.vdm`) in the **Windows Temp** directory. While this is normal for signature updates, the **volume of files** or **unusual naming** could hint at an ongoing update process or potential tampering.\n\n4. **`setup.exe` in `EdgeCore`**:\n   - **`setup.exe`** creates executables like **`ie_to_edge_stub.exe`** and **`cookie_exporter.exe`** in the **`Microsoft\\EdgeCore`** directory. These files are **not standard** for Edge and may indicate **unauthorized installations** or **malicious repackaging** of legitimate software.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Context**\n- **Legitimate Activity**:\n  - `svchost.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe` are expected during Windows Update or Defender operations.\n  - `setup.exe` is commonly used for software installations, including Edge updates.\n\n- **Suspicious Context**:\n  - **Unusual filenames** (e.g., `TurboStack.dll`, `fvereseal.dll`, `cookie_exporter.exe`) are not standard for Windows or Edge.\n  - **Lack of clear user-initiated actions** (e.g., no logs of user installations or updates) raises questions about the origin of these files.\n  - **Multiple file creations** in sensitive directories (e.g., `SoftwareDistribution`, `Temp`) without clear purpose could signal **malware persistence** or **exploitation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation**\n- **Investigate further** by:\n  - Checking **file hashes** of suspicious files (e.g., `TurboStack.dll`, `cookie_exporter.exe`) against known-good databases (e.g., VirusTotal, Microsoft Defender).\n  - Reviewing **Windows Event Logs** for related **Windows Update** or **Defender** events.\n  - Analyzing **process tree** and **network activity** during these events to detect lateral movement or exfiltration.\n  - Confirming if **user-initiated updates** or installations occurred around the same time.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events **raise concerns** due to **unusual file names, registry changes, and potential unauthorized installations**. While some activity could be legitimate, the **lack of clear context** and **non-standard components** suggest **further investigation is warranted**. This would not be classified as a **clear threat** but as **high-priority for analysis**. \n\n**Classification**: **Interesting for investigation** (Likely benign but requires deeper analysis)."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a process called setup.exe creating a file in the Program Files directory for EdgeCore. That path seems a bit off, maybe not a standard location. Then there's whoami.exe running, which is normal, but the real red flag is the PowerShell commands.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events, there's a command that creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to a suspicious location: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. That path doesn't look standard; it's using \"unidade_logico\" which might be a typo or a non-English term. Also, after creating the service, it starts it immediately. That's a common technique used by malware to persist on a system.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .NET DLLs like clr.dll and clrjit.dll. While those are legitimate, the combination with other suspicious activities might indicate something's wrong. Also, there's a FileDelete event for a temporary script, which could be an attempt to clean up evidence.\n\nAnother thing is the execution of a remote command from a file in \"registro_secundario\" with a .ps1 extension. The path again uses non-standard directories and the use of \"registro\" (which means \"registry\" in Portuguese) might be a red herring or part of obfuscation. The import-module command is trying to load a module from a non-standard path, which is suspicious.\n\nThe repeated execution of the same PowerShell command with \"Provider Lifecycle\" might be part of an attack chain. The presence of \"tarefa_logico.exe\" being loaded and the service creation points to potential malicious activity. Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll is loaded, but that's a legitimate file, so that's not necessarily bad.\n\nPutting it all together, the creation of a new service with a non-standard binary path, execution of remote commands from suspicious locations, and the use of PowerShell for these activities are all indicators of potential malicious behavior. The confidence is high because multiple events point to persistence mechanisms and suspicious file operations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell creating a new service with non-standard binary path (C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\...\\\\tarefa_logico.exe), execution of remote command scripts from non-standard directories, and loading of potentially malicious DLLs.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing some system event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with the same command line in PowerShell. The command lines involve importing a module from a path that includes \"registro_secundario\" and \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\". Then there's a try-catch block and some sleep command. That seems suspicious because importing modules and using try-catch could be part of error handling, but combined with other actions, it might be malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances where New-Service is used to create a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". Creating a new service isn't inherently bad, but if it's done without user consent or in an unusual context, it could be part of a malicious payload. Also, the fact that this is repeated multiple times might indicate an attempt to persist the service on the system.\n\nThen there are events where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path is the same \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\". This suggests that the script is being executed remotely, which is a red flag. Remote execution can be a sign of a breach, especially if the script is being run from a non-standard location or if the user didn't initiate it.\n\nThe paths mentioned, like \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\", have some directory traversal (the \"..\\\\\") which might indicate that the script is being accessed from a parent directory, possibly to bypass security measures or to obscure the actual location of the malicious file.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repetition of the same command lines across multiple events. This could be indicative of a scripted attack or a bot performing the same actions repeatedly. The presence of both service creation and remote execution in the same batch of events points towards a coordinated effort to compromise the system.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. Since there are multiple events pointing to suspicious activities—remote command execution, service creation with non-standard binaries, and repeated PowerShell commands—it's likely that this is a genuine security incident. However, I need to be cautious not to overstate the confidence if there's a possibility of false positives. But given the pattern here, the confidence is pretty high.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a justification that includes the suspicious PowerShell commands, remote execution, and service creation. The confidence would be around 0.9 because the indicators are strong and consistent across multiple events.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands import a suspicious module from a non-standard path, create a new service with a custom executable, and include remote execution indicators.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the entries have the same structure. The \"winlog\" task is \"Execute a Remote Command,\" and the file path is always \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1.\" The process is listed as \"None\" for almost all of them. There are a couple of other entries with \"services.exe\" and a \"Special Logon\" task, but those are few.\n\nNow, why would this be interesting? Well, repeated execution of the same remote command from the same file path might indicate something malicious. PowerShell scripts (.ps1 files) are often used in attacks, especially if they're being executed remotely. The fact that the process is \"None\" could mean that the execution isn't tied to a known process, which might be a red flag. It could be a sign of a script being run without proper context or permissions, maybe through a exploit or a malicious payload.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any legitimate reason for this. Maybe it's part of a normal system process, but the repetition and the same file path make me think otherwise. Also, the lack of process information might indicate that the system isn't logging the process details properly, or that the script is being injected in a way that evades detection.\n\nThe confidence here is high because multiple events with the same suspicious pattern are present. Even though there are a few other entries, the majority are focused on that one file and task. The classification would be \"INTERESTING\" because this could be a potential security incident, like a remote code execution or a script being used to compromise the system. The justification is the repeated execution of the same PowerShell script from the same path with no associated process, which is a common indicator of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated events show execution of the same PowerShell script (componente_auxiliar.ps1) from a non-standard path with no associated process, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here. The majority of them have the same structure: process is None, winlog task is 'Execute a Remote Command', and the file path is 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. There are 14 instances of this exact same event. Then there are two entries where the winlog task is 'Windows Update Agent' and the file is None.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is a security threat. Repeated execution of a remote command via a PowerShell script (since the file ends with .ps1) is suspicious. Normally, executing remote commands could be part of a cyber attack, like a remote code execution vulnerability being exploited. However, I should check if there's any context that might make this normal. For example, if it's part of a legitimate remote management tool or a scheduled task. But the fact that it's the same script being executed multiple times without any variation might indicate something malicious.\n\nThe 'Windows Update Agent' tasks might be normal, as Windows Update is a standard process. But the fact that they are logged here without any file path could be part of the normal update process. However, the key issue here is the repetition of the same remote command execution. If this is a legitimate process, it's unusual to see the same command executed so many times. \n\nAnother point is the file path. The path 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1' seems to be in a directory that's not standard. Typically, system files are in directories like C:\\Windows or C:\\Program Files. The presence of 'unidade_logico' (which translates to 'logical unit' in Portuguese) and 'registro_secundario' (secondary registry) might be a red flag, possibly indicating a non-standard or custom directory structure that could be used by malware to hide.\n\nAlso, the process being 'None' might mean that the event was logged without a specific process, which could be due to the event not being associated with a known process, or possibly a logging issue. However, in the context of security, if a remote command is executed without a clear process, that's a concern.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the repetition of the same event, the suspicious file path, and the lack of process information all point towards this being a potential security incident. However, I should also consider that maybe the logs are from a system that's undergoing some automated testing or has a legitimate remote execution setup. But without more context, the signs here are concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated entries show execution of the same PowerShell script ('componente_auxiliar.ps1') via 'Execute a Remote Command', which is suspicious.
