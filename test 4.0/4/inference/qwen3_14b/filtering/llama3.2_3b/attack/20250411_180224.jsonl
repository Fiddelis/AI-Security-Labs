The first thing I notice is multiple instances of schtasks.exe being used to create scheduled tasks. The command lines include creating a task that runs a PowerShell script with -ep bypass, which is often used to bypass execution policy restrictions. The scripts mentioned, like c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1, don't exist, which might be a red flag. Also, the tasks are set to run daily under the system account, which is unusual and could indicate persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe executing similar commands, and the repeated use of schtasks to query the task, which might be checking if the task was created successfully. The ImageLoad events for taskschd.dll are normal since that's part of the Task Scheduler service. However, the combination of creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges and using PowerShell with bypassed execution policies is suspicious.\n\nOther events involve file creation by winlogbeat and powershell, but those might be part of legitimate activities unless there's more context. The chrome.exe registry changes could be benign, but without more info, it's hard to say. However, the main red flags are the scheduled tasks with PowerShell scripts that don't exist and the use of -ep bypass, which are common in malicious activities. So, this batch seems interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple schtasks.exe commands create scheduled tasks with PowerShell scripts using -ep bypass (common in malicious activity).
