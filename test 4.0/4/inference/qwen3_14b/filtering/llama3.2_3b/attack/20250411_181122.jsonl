{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: 'whoami.exe' is run, which is a normal command to get the current user. Not suspicious on its own. Then there's a 'powershell.exe' process that's running a command to search for files containing 'password' in various formats. That seems a bit odd because searching for passwords in files might be part of a malicious activity, like looking for credentials. But it could also be a legitimate search if someone is trying to find password files.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of 'powershell.exe' with the same command line. The command uses 'findstr' and 'select-string' to search for 'password' in files. This is repeated several times, which might indicate that the process is trying to find sensitive information. Also, the 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks might be related to some logging or monitoring tools, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file, which is a log shipper. That's normal for monitoring, but maybe if it's creating a new config file, but the name is .yml.new, which could be part of an update or setup. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nOther events include 'Image loaded' for 'mscoreei.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll' which are .NET and Windows Defender components. Those are legitimate, but loading them might be part of normal operations. However, if they're being loaded in an unexpected context, that could be a red flag.\n\nThe 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' entries are just regular processes, probably harmless. The 'svchost.exe' modifying registry values is normal for system services, but again, depends on the context. If there are multiple registry changes, that might be suspicious, but here it's just two entries.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated use of PowerShell to search for passwords in files is a red flag. It's a common technique used in attacks to find credentials. The fact that it's done multiple times and the command is the same suggests it's part of a deliberate search. Also, the presence of 'winlogbeat' might be a monitoring tool, but the rest of the events don't show any obvious malicious activity beyond the PowerShell searches. However, the PowerShell command itself is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. The confidence is moderate because while the activity is unusual, it's not definitive proof of a breach without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to search for files containing 'password' across various formats (XML, DOC, TXT, XLS), which is a common technique in credential harvesting attacks. The repetitive nature of the command and the absence of clear legitimate context raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: OfficeClickToRun.exe with a DNS query. That's a legitimate Microsoft process, so probably not an issue. Next, there's a PowerShell command that's searching for files with 'pass' in their names, looking through various file types. That seems like it could be part of a password search, which might be malicious. But maybe it's just a user trying to find passwords in their own files? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That's a bit odd. Maybe a script is being set up to run at startup? Not sure if that's bad yet. Chrome.exe has several events, like DNS queries, registry changes, and loading DLLs. The DLLs mentioned are amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. So that's normal, I think. The network connections from Chrome are also common.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's just part of normal operations. But the file path is in the Downloads directory, which might be a red flag if it's not expected. The PowerShell processes accessing other processes could be normal, but the command line in one of them is deleting scheduled tasks. The schtasks commands are deleting tasks named things like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". That might be a way to remove existing tasks, which could be part of a cleanup by a malicious actor.\n\nThen there's the WMIC.exe command deleting notepad.exe processes. That's suspicious because using WMIC to delete processes can be a sign of someone trying to remove malware or other processes. However, it's also possible that this is part of a legitimate script, but combined with the other events, it might be more concerning.\n\nPutting this all together: the PowerShell command searching for passwords, the deletion of scheduled tasks, and the WMIC process deletion. These actions could indicate someone trying to clean up after an attack or gather information. However, there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious intent. The presence of multiple scheduled task deletions and the password search might be more indicative of a security investigation or a script that's part of a larger attack. But without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the combination of these events does raise some flags that warrant further investigation. So I think the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence of around 0.6. Not certain, but enough to flag for review.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell searching for credentials in files, deletion of scheduled tasks, and WMIC process deletion. These could indicate data exfiltration or cleanup post-compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about WMIC.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender directory. That's a bit suspicious because Windows Defender's files shouldn't be loaded by WMIC, which is often used for remote management. But maybe it's a false positive?\n\nThen there are several instances of cmd.exe and net.exe deleting user accounts. Commands like \"net user \/del\" are used to remove users, which could be part of an attack if done without authorization. The fact that multiple user deletions are happening might indicate someone is trying to remove administrative accounts or clean up after themselves.\n\nThere's also a process creating event for sc.exe deleting a service called \"win32times\". Deleting services can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if it's a service that's not supposed to be there or if it's part of a larger attack.\n\nThe PowerShell.exe processes being accessed might be part of scripting activities. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious. The Registry value set events could be part of configuration changes, but again, need more info.\n\nLooking at the files involved, the first one is from Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. That's a legitimate file, but the fact that WMIC is loading it might be unusual. Maybe a spoofing attack or a compromised process.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple user deletions, service deletion, and unusual process activity. These could be signs of an attacker trying to remove evidence or take control. However, some of these actions could be legitimate if part of a script or maintenance task. But the combination of deleting users, services, and the WMIC loading a Defender DLL seems suspicious. I'd lean towards INTERESTING with moderate confidence because while some actions are normal, the overall pattern suggests potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of user accounts via 'net user \/del', deletion of a Windows service ('win32times'), and WMIC loading a file from Windows Defender's directory (potentially indicating compromised system components). These actions align with lateral movement and cleanup phases of attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a deletion of a file named tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe in the Temp directory. That's a red flag because malicious software often deletes files after execution to cover tracks.\n\nThen there are multiple process creations and accesses involving PowerShell. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for executing commands. The events show that PowerShell is being used, but I need to check if there's any suspicious command lines. Looking at the command_line fields, some entries have \"powershell.exe & {}\" which seems like a placeholder or empty command, maybe just logging or testing. However, the fact that there are so many PowerShell-related events might indicate an attempt to run scripts or commands.\n\nThere's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp folder (__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1). Creating and deleting files quickly can be part of an attack to avoid detection. The presence of both creation and deletion events for the same file is suspicious.\n\nOther events include process access and image loading, such as loading mscoree.dll and MpOAV.dll. While these are legitimate system files, the context matters. If they're being accessed in an unusual way, it might be a sign of something malicious. However, the events don't show any obvious malicious activity beyond the file operations.\n\nThe repeated use of whoami.exe might be benign, like checking user privileges, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it could be part of a larger attack. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The main points are the file deletion and the PowerShell activities. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch has some suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because some events might be normal, but the combination of file deletion and PowerShell usage is concerning enough to classify as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process creations\/accesses combined with file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, which are common indicators of malicious activity. The deletion of a decoded executable file and subsequent creation\/deletion of a PowerShell script file in Temp suggest potential evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The answer should be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event to see what's going on. The first two entries involve 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll'. Wait, 'calc.exe' is a legitimate Windows process, but 'Calculator.exe' might be a typo or a different process. However, both are loading 'urlmon.dll', which is a legitimate DLL part of Windows. But why would that be suspicious? Maybe if they're loading from an unexpected path, but here the path is 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll', which is correct. So maybe that's normal.\n\nNext, there's an entry about 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, but creating a file in the Downloads folder might not be suspicious on its own. However, the filename is '.winlogbeat.yml.new', which could be part of a configuration file. Maybe it's just a normal installation or setup process.\n\nThen there's 'powershell.exe' with a 'Process accessed' event. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but without more context, like command-line arguments or unusual activities, it's hard to tell. The file is 'None', so maybe it's just a process access without a specific file involved.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries have DNS queries and network connections. Multiple DNS queries from chrome are normal, especially if the user is browsing. Network connections are also common. However, if there were unusual domains or IP addresses, that might be a red flag, but the logs don't specify those details. So maybe not suspicious here.\n\nPutting it all together: The first two events involve legitimate processes loading legitimate DLLs. The winlogbeat event could be part of a normal setup. The PowerShell and Chrome activities are common. There's no obvious malicious activity here. However, I should check for any anomalies. For example, if 'Calculator.exe' is actually a malicious process, but the log doesn't indicate that. The paths are all legitimate. No signs of privilege escalation, unexpected network activity, or file modifications. So maybe this batch isn't interesting. But I need to be cautious. The confidence level would be low because there's no clear indicator of compromise. So classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (calc.exe, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe) interacting with standard system components (urlmon.dll, DNS queries, file creation in user Downloads directory). No anomalous behavior, suspicious file paths, or high-risk activities detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
