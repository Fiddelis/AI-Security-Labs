{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe. That's common, but the tasks associated with them might be a clue. There are multiple ProcessAccess events, which might be normal, but then there's a ProcessCreate event with a command line that includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. These commands are typically used to gather information about the system, users, and groups. That's suspicious because they could be part of an attacker enumerating the system to find vulnerabilities or sensitive data.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events where PowerShell is loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. That's part of the .NET runtime, so maybe PowerShell is running a script that uses .NET, which isn't inherently bad. However, when combined with the other commands, it might indicate something more.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate and FileDelete event for a temporary script file. The file is created and then immediately deleted, which is a common tactic to avoid leaving evidence. The filename includes __PSScriptPolicyTest, which might be a red herring, but the fact that it's created and deleted quickly is suspicious.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated Provider Lifecycle events with the same command line. Provider Lifecycle might relate to event logging, but the repetition could indicate something is wrong, like a loop or a script that's not terminating properly.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes running commands that gather system information, loading .NET components, creating and deleting a temporary script file. This behavior is often seen in malicious activities, such as reconnaissance during an attack. Even though some of these actions can be legitimate, the combination here, especially the file creation and deletion, and the repeated commands, raises a red flag. The confidence isn't 100% because there's a possibility of false positives, but the pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands (e.g., 'net user', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey.exe \/list') and loading .NET runtime DLLs, combined with temporary script file creation\/deletion, indicative of potential reconnaissance or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at the entire batch as a whole, not individual events.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with the same command line in PowerShell. The command line includes a series of commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', and listing directories and files in C:\\Users. These commands are typically used for enumerating user accounts, groups, and stored credentials. That's a red flag because such activities are often part of reconnaissance during a security breach.\n\nThen there are entries related to 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' executing 'user' commands. The 'net user' command can be used to view or modify user accounts, which is another suspicious activity if done unexpectedly. Also, the presence of 'net1.exe' might be a typo or a malicious variant of 'net.exe', which could indicate a potential threat.\n\nLooking at the file events, there's a mention of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and shipping logs, but creating a new configuration file might be normal. However, the rest of the logs don't show other file creation events that could indicate data exfiltration or malware installation.\n\nThe 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks in the winlog entries might relate to the PowerShell processes, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the repetition of the same PowerShell command across multiple events suggests a pattern, which is concerning.\n\nAlso, the numerous entries with 'Security Group Management' and 'User Account Management' tasks could indicate that there's an attempt to manipulate user accounts or groups, which is a common attack vector. However, since these entries have 'process' as 'None', it might mean that the logs are incomplete or that the events were not properly captured by the logging system. That could be a sign of tampering or a system issue, but it's not definitive.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated PowerShell commands that are enumerating system information, combined with the 'net' commands and the security-related tasks, suggest that someone is trying to gather information about the system's users and groups. This is a classic sign of a reconnaissance phase in an attack. Even though some entries don't have process details, the overall pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. The confidence here is high because the combination of these events points towards potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to enumerate user accounts, groups, credentials, and file systems (e.g., 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', 'ls C:\/Users').

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of system events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The options are either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events to see if there's any suspicious activity. Let me scan through each line. \n\nThe first few entries have \"winlog\" with \"task\": \"Security Group Management\" and process as None. Not sure what that means yet. Then there's a process called cmdkey.exe with the command line \/list. That's a legitimate command for listing credentials, but maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are several entries with powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. I see \"Process accessed\" and \"File created\" events. The file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_logico.txt seems normal, but another file created in AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive might be more suspicious. Startup profiles could be used for persistence, but I need to check more.\n\nThere's a \"Registry value set\" event multiple times involving powershell.exe, conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and svchost.exe. Registry changes can be part of malware behavior, but again, need context. The \"File created\" event for winlogbeat.yml.new might be related to a log shipper, but if it's in the Downloads folder, maybe it's just a normal installation.\n\nLooking at the \"Image loaded\" events for urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate DLL, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, maybe. However, the process names here are Calculator.exe and svchost.exe, which are normal.\n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe command, which is just checking the user, so that's normal. The net.exe and net1.exe commands are related to network configuration. \"net localgroup\" is a standard command to view local groups, but \"net1.exe\" might be a typo or a different executable. Wait, \"net1.exe\" isn't a standard Windows tool. That could be a red flag. Maybe a typo, but if it's actually being executed, that might be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry. While PowerShell is common, excessive access or registry changes could indicate someone trying to manipulate the system. However, without more context like network activity or unusual commands, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe presence of multiple \"Registry value set\" events might indicate configuration changes, but again, not necessarily malicious. The files created are in typical locations, but the StartupProfileData file could be used for persistence. However, just creating a file there doesn't confirm malicious intent.\n\nPutting it all together: There's some suspicious elements like the net1.exe command, repeated PowerShell activity, and registry changes. However, none of the events are clearly malicious on their own. The confidence here is moderate. It's not a clear-cut case, but there are enough anomalies that might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process accesses, registry modifications, and file creations in user directories suggest potential malicious activity. The presence of 'net1.exe' (non-standard tool) and repeated process access events warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
