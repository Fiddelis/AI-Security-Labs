{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the processes involved. There's chrome.exe, which is normal. Then powershell.exe and cmd.exe appear multiple times. The cmd.exe entries have commands like 'systeminfo' and 'reg query' which are typical for gathering system information. But when combined with other activities, maybe that's a red flag.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks: there are Dns queries, Registry value sets, Process creates, and Image loaded events. The Image loaded events mention amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process is loading it, that's normal. But if it's being loaded by something unexpected, that could be an issue. However, in the logs, systeminfo.exe is loading amsi.dll, which might be okay, but I need to check if that's typical.\n\nAnother thing is the use of reg query on the Disk Enum registry key. That could be part of enumerating disk information, which is normal, but if done in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack. Also, the presence of multiple registry value sets could indicate attempts to modify system settings.\n\nThe svchost.exe process is creating files in the Windows Event Logs directory. That's a bit unusual because svchost is a generic host process for Windows services. Creating event logs might be normal, but if it's done in a way that's not typical, it could be a sign of something malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere's also a WmiPrvSE.exe process, which is related to Windows Management Instrumentation. The command line includes -secured and -Embedding, which might be part of legitimate WMI operations, but again, depends on the context.\n\nThe presence of multiple powershell.exe and cmd.exe processes running commands that query the registry and system information might be part of a reconnaissance phase. Attackers often use these tools to gather information about the system before escalating privileges or moving laterally.\n\nHowever, none of the events here show obvious signs of malware, like unexpected processes, network connections to suspicious IPs, or file modifications that aren't standard. The logs are mostly system-level activities that could be part of normal operations or just initial reconnaissance.\n\nConsidering all this, the activities are somewhat suspicious but not definitively malicious. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there's enough to warrant further investigation. So, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.65.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creation events involving command-line tools (cmd.exe, powershell.exe) querying system information and registry keys, combined with image load events for system DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll). These activities may indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts, though no direct malicious payloads are evident.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file at the path C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipper, and it might be creating configuration files. But I should note that.\n\nThen there are several events involving ApplicationFrameHost.exe and powershell.exe setting registry values. Setting registry values can be suspicious, especially if done by PowerShell, which is often used in attacks. But without more context, it's hard to say. The same goes for Process accessed by PowerShell. However, these might be part of normal operations, like software updates or user actions.\n\nChrome.exe has a lot of events here. It's creating pipes, setting registry values, and loading images like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. Loading these might be normal if Chrome is interacting with the defender, but maybe there's something off here. However, the paths are standard system directories, so that's probably legitimate.\n\nAnother event is powershell.exe creating a file called objeto_padrao.txt. That's a Portuguese term meaning \"default object,\" but the file name itself doesn't immediately scream malicious. However, the fact that PowerShell is creating files could be part of a script, but again, could be normal.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: there's a lot of activity from Chrome and PowerShell, but most of the events seem to be part of normal operations. The winlogbeat events are related to its own configuration files. The registry changes and file creations might be benign, but the high frequency of events from Chrome and PowerShell could indicate something. However, without more context like unusual processes, unexpected network activity, or other indicators of compromise, it's hard to classify this as malicious.\n\nBut wait, the repetition of Chrome.exe events with registry changes might be a red flag. However, Chrome is a common application that might interact with the registry for updates or settings. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events for legitimate DLLs might be normal. The file creation by winlogbeat is expected during setup.\n\nSo, considering all that, the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. They seem to be part of normal system operations, even though there's a lot of activity. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of a security incident. However, I should check if there's any unusual combination. For example, if the registry changes were from unexpected processes, but in this case, they're from known processes like Chrome and PowerShell. The confidence would be medium, maybe around 0.6, because while there's a lot of activity, it's not clearly malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily reflect normal system operations (e.g., winlogbeat configuration file creation, chrome.exe interacting with system components, and PowerShell\/registry activity). No clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a single event in JSONL format. The event shows that chrome.exe is involved in a registry value set event. The task is to determine if this batch (which only has this one event) is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what normal behavior looks like. Chrome.exe is a legitimate process, but it's also a common target for malware. However, a single registry event might not be suspicious on its own. But since the batch only has this one event, there's not much context. \n\nWait, the user said to analyze the entire batch as a whole. Since there's only one event here, I need to assess if this single event is enough to raise suspicion. Registry value changes by chrome.exe could be part of normal operations, like updating settings. But without more events, like multiple registry changes, network activity, or file modifications, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe confidence level would be low because a single event isn't enough to confirm malicious activity. However, the presence of chrome.exe in a registry event might be worth noting, but not necessarily a red flag. The justification should mention that a single event isn't enough to determine if it's malicious. So the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence of maybe 0.3, since there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior in just this one event.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"A single registry event related to chrome.exe is likely part of normal browser operations and lacks context for malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
