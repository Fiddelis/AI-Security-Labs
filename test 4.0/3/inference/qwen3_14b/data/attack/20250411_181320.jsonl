{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. But then I see a whoami.exe process being created. Whoami is a legitimate command to get the current user, but if it's being used in a suspicious context, that could be an issue. However, there's no immediate sign of misuse here yet.\n\nThen there's a lot of activity around powershell.exe. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. One entry has a command line with \"ls -recurse\", \"get-childitem -recurse\", and \"gci -recurse\". These are standard PowerShell commands for listing files recursively. But the fact that it's being run multiple times might be normal, but maybe not. However, the more concerning part is the image loads. There are several entries where PowerShell loads DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET. That's normal for PowerShell, especially if it's running scripts that require .NET components.\n\nWait, but then there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_2ou0ewlg.ry1.ps1. The name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be part of a script that's testing execution policies. However, creating and deleting a file could be a sign of something trying to execute a script temporarily. But since it's in the Temp folder and is deleted afterward, it could be a legitimate action, like a script that's self-cleaning. However, the fact that it's done by PowerShell might be worth looking into, especially if there's no clear reason for it.\n\nAnother point is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with the same command line. Provider Lifecycle events in Windows logs usually relate to WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) activity. If there's a lot of these, it could indicate that someone is interacting with WMI, which is sometimes used by malware for persistence or data exfiltration. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nLooking back at the PowerShell events, there are multiple \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" events. Changing registry values can be a sign of configuration changes, which might be benign or malicious. But again, without knowing the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe key suspicious elements here are the creation and deletion of the temporary script file and the repeated WMI provider lifecycle events. However, these could also be part of normal system operations or legitimate scripts. But considering that PowerShell is often used in attacks, and the combination of these events, it might be worth investigating further. The presence of multiple events related to PowerShell, along with the temporary file, could indicate that someone is trying to run a script in a way that's trying to avoid detection. However, I'm not 100% sure. The confidence is medium here. Maybe around 0.6 or 0.7. The justification would be the combination of PowerShell activity, temporary file creation\/deletion, and WMI events. But I need to check if there's anything more obvious.\n\nWait, the image load events include MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so that's not a problem. The other DLLs are part of the .NET framework, which is normal for PowerShell. So maybe those are okay.\n\nPutting it all together: the most suspicious parts are the temporary script file and the repeated PowerShell commands. However, without more context or other indicators, it's not definitive. But enough to flag for further investigation. So the answer would be that this is interesting, with a moderate confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Activity:**\n   - **Chrome.exe** performing DNS queries and network connections: Normal for a browser.\n   - **Whoami.exe** execution: A standard command-line utility for retrieving user context, though its presence alone is not suspicious.\n   - **.NET-related DLLs** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) loaded by PowerShell: Common in PowerShell script execution.\n\n2. **Suspicious Indicators:**\n   - **Temporary Script File Creation\/Deletion:**\n     - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) is created in the `%TEMP%` directory and immediately deleted. This pattern is often seen in **malicious scripts** that execute temporarily to avoid leaving persistent traces.\n     - The filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might hint at **script execution policy bypass** or testing, a common tactic in attacks.\n   - **Repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events:**\n     - Multiple PowerShell processes trigger \"Provider Lifecycle\" logs, which are often associated with **WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)** activity. While WMI is legitimate, excessive or unexplained use can indicate **malware persistence or data exfiltration**.\n   - **PowerShell Command Patterns:**\n     - Repeated use of `ls -recurse`, `get-childitem -recurse`, and `gci -recurse` suggests **recursive directory scanning**, which could be part of a **reconnaissance phase** (e.g., searching for sensitive files or credentials).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe activity is **potentially suspicious** due to the combination of:\n- Temporary script file creation\/deletion (common in stealthy attacks).\n- Repeated WMI-related PowerShell activity.\n- Recursive directory scanning, which may indicate **data collection**.\n\nWhile these events could be part of legitimate operations (e.g., system diagnostics, script testing), the **pattern of transient file creation and WMI interaction** warrants further investigation (e.g., checking for unauthorized access, script content, or anomalous registry changes).\n\n### **Confidence Level:**\n**Moderate (0.6–0.7)** – The indicators are not definitive proof of malicious activity but suggest a need for deeper analysis."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the entries are about PowerShell processes running commands like 'ls -recurse', 'get-childitem -recurse', and 'gci -recurse'. These commands are used to list files recursively, which is a common administrative task. However, when these commands are executed in PowerShell, especially multiple times, it might be a sign of someone trying to gather information about the file system. But is that suspicious? Well, it depends on the context. If it's a normal user doing routine checks, it's not a problem. But if it's part of a larger pattern, like trying to find sensitive files or exfiltrate data, that's a red flag.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are entries related to 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Engine Lifecycle', 'Pipe Created', 'Image loaded', 'File created', and 'Registry value set'. The 'Image loaded' event mentions a DLL from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate process, so probably not malicious. However, the 'File created' events show files being created in user directories, like 'objeto_principal.txt' and a .yml.new file. The .yml file might be a configuration file for something like Winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. But creating a .yml.new file could be part of an attack if it's trying to modify configurations.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Registry value set' events for svchost.exe and powershell.exe. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or modifying system behavior. However, svchost.exe is a normal system process, so that's not necessarily bad. But if there are multiple changes, it might indicate someone trying to alter system settings.\n\nThe 'User Account Management' events are a bit concerning. If there are multiple logons or account management activities, that could indicate an attacker creating new accounts or modifying existing ones. However, the logs don't specify any specific account changes, just the task name. So maybe not enough info here.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of the same PowerShell command across multiple events. If this is part of a script or automated process, it's not necessarily malicious. But if it's being run repeatedly without a clear reason, that's suspicious.\n\nThe presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files might be normal if it's part of log collection. But the .yml.new file could be a sign of configuration tampering if it's not expected.\n\nPutting this all together: The main points are the repeated PowerShell commands, the file creations in user directories, and the registry changes. However, without more context, like network activity, unusual processes, or lateral movement, it's hard to say. The events here are not overtly malicious, but the combination of PowerShell scripting and file\/registry changes might warrant further investigation. So, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence because there are enough suspicious elements that could indicate a security incident, but not enough to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Repetitive PowerShell commands using 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse' may indicate file system enumeration. Multiple 'Registry value set' events and file creation in user directories (e.g., 'objeto_principal.txt') could suggest potential configuration tampering or data exfiltration attempts. The presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating configuration files (.yml.new) may indicate log collection tool usage, but requires further context to assess legitimacy.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these logs. The first nine entries are all about 'User Account Management' with no process or file details. That's a bit odd because usually, if there's activity related to user accounts, there should be some process involved. Maybe these are just normal system events, but repeated multiple times without any specific details might be a red flag.\n\nThen, the next entries have more specific information. There's a 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a tool for collecting and shipping logs, so that might be part of a legitimate setup. But the file path ends with .yml.new, which could be a temporary file. Not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nNext, 'RuntimeBroker.exe' and 'notepad.exe' setting registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that's normal. Notepad doing registry changes might be okay if it's part of a user's actions, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Then 'powershell.exe' accessing a process. PowerShell is common, but if it's doing something unusual, that could be a problem. However, the log just says 'Process accessed' without details on what's happening.\n\nThen there's 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll'. Urlmon.dll is part of Windows, so loading it is normal. But why are both calc.exe and Calculator.exe doing this? Maybe a typo in the process names? Or perhaps different instances of the same process. The fact that two different processes are loading the same DLL might not be significant on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, most of the logs are either normal system activities or lack enough detail to be suspicious. The repeated 'User Account Management' events without process info might be a bit odd, but not necessarily malicious. The other events don't show any clear signs of intrusion or malicious activity. So I think this batch isn't interesting enough for further investigation. The confidence is medium because there's no obvious threat, but the lack of process details in some logs is a minor concern.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events primarily show normal system activities (e.g., registry changes, file creation by legitimate tools like winlogbeat.exe) and lack indicators of compromise. No suspicious patterns or malicious artifacts detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
