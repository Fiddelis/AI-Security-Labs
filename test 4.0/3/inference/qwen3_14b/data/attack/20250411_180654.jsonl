{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nThen there are several entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Multiple times, but registry changes can be normal, especially for browsers. However, repeated changes might indicate something, but not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate command to check user identity. Not a red flag by itself.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saves to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That script name sounds like it could be used for keylogging, which is malicious. The fact that it's being executed multiple times and the log path is in the temporary directory might be a sign of data exfiltration.\n\nThen, there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs. Those are part of the .NET runtime, so they're legitimate. But combined with the previous PowerShell activity, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nAlso, the same Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script is mentioned in multiple command lines, which suggests that the attacker is trying to capture keystrokes, possibly to steal sensitive information. The use of PowerShell for this is common in attacks, especially if it's executing scripts that aren't signed or are obfuscated.\n\nThe repetition of registry events and the multiple PowerShell processes accessing and creating files could indicate persistence mechanisms or attempts to evade detection. The combination of these events—especially the keystroke logging—points towards a potential security incident.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the presence of the keystroke logging script, along with multiple PowerShell activities and image loads, suggests malicious behavior. Even though some events are normal, the combination here is suspicious and worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious scripts (e.g., 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1') to log keystrokes to temporary files, combined with frequent registry modifications and .NET DLL loads, indicates potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances where PowerShell is executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The command lines all have similar structures, with different paths each time. The -LogPath parameter points to $env:TEMP\\key.log. Now, Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which is typically a malicious activity, like keylogging. That's a red flag right there.\n\nThen, there are events related to file creation and deletion. For example, a temporary file is created and then deleted. That's common in some malicious activities to avoid leaving traces. Also, the PowerShell process is involved in creating and deleting files, which might be part of an attempt to execute scripts without leaving evidence.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple executions of the same script from different paths. Even though the paths vary, the script name is consistent. This repetition could indicate an attempt to run the same malicious script multiple times, possibly to ensure it's executed or to bypass defenses.\n\nThere are also entries about image loaded, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That might be normal, but combined with the other events, it could be that the malware is trying to interact with or bypass the antivirus.\n\nThe presence of \"Execute a Remote Command\" in one of the logs is another suspicious point. That could mean someone is trying to run commands remotely, which is a common attack vector.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any benign activity here. For example, the file creation and deletion by PowerShell could be part of legitimate scripts. But the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a known malicious script, leans towards it being harmful. Also, the fact that the log files are being written to the TEMP directory is a common tactic for malware to store data temporarily.\n\nConsidering all these points, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions of a keylogging script, file creation\/deletion, and remote command execution suggests a potential security threat. The confidence is high, but not 100% because sometimes legitimate scripts might use similar names, though that's less common. Still, the pattern here is strong enough to flag it as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' (a known keystroke logging script) from various paths, combined with file creation\/deletion patterns and remote command execution, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch as a whole and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. The first event is about svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization directory. I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. The file path mentioned is part of the DeliveryOptimization feature, which is used for Windows Update and other system functions. The file name keyValueLKG.dat doesn't ring any bells as a malicious file. So this might be a normal system activity.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a new file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and forwarding logs. The file path here is a .yml.new file, which could be part of a configuration setup. Since the user is downloading and setting up Winlogbeat, this seems like a normal user action. No signs of malicious activity here.\n\nThird event is powershell.exe creating a text file in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is a common tool used by both users and attackers. However, in this case, the file is just a plain text file named entrada_padrao.txt. There's no indication of malicious code here. It could be a user creating a file, which is normal behavior.\n\nNow, looking at the combination of all events. All three events involve file creation, but none of the processes are typically associated with malware. The files created are in legitimate locations and by known tools. There's no unusual activity like unexpected network connections, privilege escalation, or access to sensitive areas. The processes involved are all legitimate, and the actions taken are typical for their purposes. \n\nI should check if there's any pattern or unusual combination. For example, if all three were from the same user or if there were multiple files created in sensitive directories. But in this case, each event is isolated and doesn't show any suspicious patterns. The user might be installing software or configuring tools, which is normal. \n\nTherefore, the classification here is likely \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no evidence of malicious behavior in the batch. The confidence is medium-high since the events are normal but could be part of a larger context. However, based solely on the provided data, there's nothing to flag.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) creating files in expected locations (system directories, user Downloads folder). No suspicious patterns, lateral movement, or malicious payloads detected in the provided data.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
