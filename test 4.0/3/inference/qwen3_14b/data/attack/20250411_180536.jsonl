{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's a line where the process is None and the task is also None. That might be a placeholder or an error, but not sure yet.\n\nThen, there's powershell.exe being accessed, which is common but can be used for malicious activities. The next event is whoami.exe being created, which is a standard command to get user info. However, the command line for cmd.exe is more concerning. It's using sc.exe to create a service with a path that looks suspicious: \"C:\\\\elemento_geral\\\\componente_comum\\\\modulo_geral\\\\bin\\\\unidade_base.exe\". Creating services with arbitrary paths can be a sign of malware trying to persist.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries of services.exe modifying registry values. Services.exe is part of Windows, but changing registry values repeatedly might indicate something trying to alter system settings. Also, sc.exe is being used again to start a service named \"elemento_auxiliar\", which could be a malicious service.\n\nThe image load events for pacote_padrao.exe, tarefa_base.exe, and objeto_logico.exe are loading DLLs from the Windows System32 and .NET directories. Those are legitimate locations, but if the executables themselves are malicious, it could be a problem. However, the presence of .NET DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll might be part of a legitimate application, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: the suspicious parts are the use of sc.exe to create services with non-standard paths, the multiple registry modifications by services.exe, and the image loads from potentially legitimate but also possibly exploited paths. The combination of these events could indicate an attempt to install a backdoor or persistence mechanism. However, some of these might be benign if they're part of a legitimate software installation. But given that there are multiple services being created and registry changes, along with the unusual paths, it's leaning towards being interesting for investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because some components are normal, but the combination does raise flags.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Unusual service creation via sc.exe with non-standard paths (e.g., 'C:\\\\elemento_geral\\\\...\\\\unidade_base.exe') 2) Repeated registry modifications by services.exe 3) PowerShell and cmd.exe usage with potential persistence mechanisms. These patterns suggest possible malicious behavior attempting to establish persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are processes like tarefa_logico.exe and estrutura_principal.exe loading images, which are .dll files from the Windows assembly and .NET Framework. These seem legitimate because they're part of the standard system paths. But then, there's a lot of Registry value set events from various processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, elemento_ativo.exe, modulo_secundario.exe, powershell.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and svchost.exe. \n\nNow, Registry events can be normal, but when multiple different processes are setting registry values, that might be a red flag. Especially if they're not typical processes. However, some of these are common system processes (like svchost.exe, conhost.exe), which might be doing legitimate things. But then there's also processes like elemento_ativo.exe and modulo_secundario.exe, which sound like they could be part of some application, but their names aren't standard. \n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating files in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, so creating a .yml.new file might be part of its normal operation, like configuration changes. But if that's the only file creation, maybe it's not suspicious. \n\nHowever, the repetition of Registry value set events from multiple different processes might indicate some kind of configuration changes or attempts to modify system settings. But without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother thing to note is that there are two entries for winlogbeat.exe creating the same file, which might just be a duplicate log entry. Also, the processes like Calculator.exe and calc.exe loading urlmon.dll are normal, as urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer and is used for URL handling.\n\nSo, putting this all together: there are several registry modifications by various processes, some of which are not standard. However, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity like unexpected file creations, unusual network activity, or privilege escalation. The events might just be part of normal operations, but the combination of multiple registry changes and non-standard process names could be worth investigating further. \n\nI think the confidence here is moderate. It's not a clear-cut case of malware, but the number and variety of registry events might be suspicious. So, I would classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.6. The justification would be the multiple registry modifications by various processes, some of which are not standard, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry value set events from non-standard processes (elemento_ativo.exe, modulo_secundario.exe) combined with legitimate system processes may indicate suspicious configuration changes. No clear malicious activity detected, but the pattern warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
