{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' being used. PowerShell is common, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be a red flag. The 'cmd.exe' entries have some command lines that look like they're trying to create services. For example, one line says \"sc create win32times binPath= \\\"cmd \/c start c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\\\"\". Wait, the script path is non-existent, which could be a sign of a failed attempt to execute a malicious script. Also, there's a mention of 'sc qc win32times', which checks the configuration of a service. Maybe the attacker is trying to create a persistence mechanism by setting up a service that runs a script.\n\nThen there's the 'Registry value set' events. Multiple processes like 'services.exe', 'cmd.exe', and others are modifying registry values. Changing registry keys can be part of malware installation or persistence, so that's concerning. The 'Image loaded' events for 'urlmon.dll' might be normal, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, it could be a problem. However, 'urlmon.dll' is a legitimate Windows component, so maybe that's just part of normal operations.\n\nAlso, there's a 'notepad.exe' and 'calc.exe' involved, but those are typically benign. However, the fact that 'calc.exe' is loading 'urlmon.dll' could be normal, but I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity around that.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated 'Registry value set' tasks. If multiple processes are modifying the registry, especially system-related ones, that might indicate an attempt to alter system settings for persistence or to hide the malicious activity.\n\nThe 'sc.exe' commands are creating a service with a path to a non-existent script. That might be a failed attempt to execute a script, which could be part of a larger attack. If the script doesn't exist, maybe the attacker is trying to trick the system into running something that's not there, or perhaps it's a typo. Either way, creating a service with a non-existent path is suspicious.\n\nAlso, the 'whoami.exe' is being run, which is a legitimate tool to check user context. But if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious commands, it might be part of reconnaissance.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple process creations, registry modifications, attempts to create services with non-existent scripts, and repeated access to processes like PowerShell and CMD. These could be signs of an attacker trying to establish persistence, execute commands, and modify the system. However, some of these events could be part of normal operations. But the combination of creating a service with a non-existent script and multiple registry changes makes me think this is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated PowerShell and CMD process creation, registry modifications, and an attempt to create a service with a non-existent script path (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1). These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior for persistence or execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these logs. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, but maybe the user is downloading something. Then there are several entries about ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and others like chrome.exe and powershell.exe performing registry value sets and process accesses. \n\nWait, the chrome.exe entries are mostly registry changes, which could be normal, but there's also an ImageLoad event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. However, the repeated registry events from chrome.exe might be suspicious. But then again, sometimes browsers modify the registry for settings.\n\nThe powershell.exe events are accessing processes, which could be part of normal operations, but could also be malicious. However, without more context, like unexpected command-line arguments or unusual process trees, it's hard to tell. The first event is just a file creation, which isn't necessarily bad. \n\nPutting it all together, there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The events are mostly normal system activities. The classification should be NOT INTERESTING because there's no strong evidence of a threat here. Confidence is around 0.6 because some events are neutral, but there's no obvious attack pattern.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show normal system activity (file creation by winlogbeat, registry changes by legitimate processes like chrome and powershell, and standard DLL loading). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
