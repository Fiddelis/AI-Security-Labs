{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's chrome.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, and Calculator.exe. The winlog tasks include DNS queries, network connections, registry changes, process accesses, and image loads. \n\nHmm, the first few entries are chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. Not sure yet. Powershell.exe being accessed could be normal, but sometimes it's used for malicious scripts.\n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that uses schtasks to create scheduled tasks named things like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The command line includes running calc.exe. That seems odd because calc.exe is just the calculator, but creating scheduled tasks with odd names might be a red flag. Also, the user might be trying to hide malicious activities by using scheduled tasks.\n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe creating a task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same calc.exe command. Then there's a file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_comum_005_OnLogon. Scheduled tasks in the System32 directory might be legitimate, but the names are suspicious and don't follow standard naming conventions. \n\nAlso, multiple svchost.exe processes are modifying the registry. While svchost is a normal system process, excessive registry changes could indicate something's wrong. The image loaded events for urlmon.dll and taskschd.dll are standard, but combined with the scheduled task creations, it might be part of a larger scheme.\n\nPutting this together: the creation of multiple scheduled tasks with unusual names, using calc.exe (which is benign but could be a decoy), and the involvement of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe might indicate an attempt to establish persistent access or execute commands. The combination of these events, especially the scheduled tasks and registry changes, could be signs of malicious activity. However, without more context, it's a bit tricky. But the presence of these specific patterns does raise a red flag. So, I think this is interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of unusual scheduled tasks (e.g., 'elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon'), use of cmd.exe\/schtasks.exe to execute calc.exe, and repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are about 'svchost.exe' and 'chrome.exe' performing registry value sets. There are also a few file creations, like the one for 'pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup' in the System32 Tasks directory. That path looks suspicious because System32 is a critical system directory, and creating a task there might be part of a persistence mechanism. \n\nThen there's a file created by 'winlogbeat.exe' in the Downloads directory, which is normal. But then there's a 'unidade_ativo.txt' created by PowerShell. Not sure if that's malicious yet. Also, 'chrome.exe' is loading some DLLs, like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that might be normal behavior. \n\nHowever, the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe and svchost.exe could be a red flag. svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, but if it's making a lot of registry changes, that might indicate something's wrong. Also, the task created in System32 might be a way for malware to execute on startup. \n\nBut wait, are there any other signs? The presence of 'powershell.exe' creating a file might be benign, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like downloading or executing scripts, that's bad. However, in the given logs, there's no indication of that. The file created is just a text file. \n\nAnother thing is that multiple processes are making registry changes. While some are legitimate, the volume and the specific paths might be suspicious. The 'pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup' seems like a random name, which could be a sign of obfuscation. \n\nBut I should also consider that some of these events are normal. For example, chrome.exe loading amsi.dll is part of its operation. However, the repeated registry events might be more concerning. \n\nPutting it all together, the creation of a scheduled task in System32 and multiple registry modifications by various processes could indicate a potential security incident. However, without more context, like network activity or other anomalies, it's a bit tricky. But given the information, the presence of the task in a system directory and the number of registry changes might be enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and chrome.exe, combined with a suspicious file creation in the System32\\\\Tasks directory (potentially indicating persistence mechanism setup).\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not. So, first, I'll go through each line.\n\nAll the entries are in JSONL format. Each line has a process, a winlog task, and a file which is None here. The first six entries are all chrome.exe with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Then there's powershell.exe with \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\", then whoami.exe with \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\", and another powershell.exe with the same process accessed task.\n\nHmm. Chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times. That's a bit unusual because Chrome is a common application, but modifying the registry could be part of normal operations, like updates or settings. However, if it's happening multiple times in quick succession, maybe that's suspicious. But the logs don't have timestamps, so I can't tell if they're spread out or clustered.\n\nThen there's the whoami.exe command. That's a legitimate tool to check user context, but if it's being run in a suspicious context or with unexpected parameters, that could be a red flag. However, in this case, the command line is just \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\", which is normal. But maybe the process creation is part of a larger attack chain.\n\nPowerShell being accessed is also common, but if there are multiple accesses, that might indicate someone is trying to run scripts. However, again, without more context, it's hard to say. The key here is that all these events are from legitimate processes, but the repetition of registry changes by chrome.exe might be a sign of something. But is that enough?\n\nWait, the classification needs to be based on the entire batch. If all the events are from normal processes and the tasks are part of regular operations, then it's not interesting. But if there's a pattern that deviates from normal behavior, like excessive registry changes or unexpected process accesses, that could be interesting.\n\nBut Chrome modifying the registry a few times could be normal, like setting preferences or extensions. However, if it's a lot, maybe. But the user only shows six instances. Without knowing the baseline, it's tricky. The whoami.exe is a single instance, which is normal. PowerShell accesses could be part of normal system operations.\n\nSo putting it all together, the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. They are all from legitimate processes, and the tasks are part of standard system events. Therefore, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior in the batch.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe) performing standard system tasks (registry modification, process access, process creation). No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
