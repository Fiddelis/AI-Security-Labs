{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through this step by step. The user provided a list of system events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the processes involved. There's svchost.exe, which is a normal Windows process, but it's also commonly used by malware. Then there's MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is part of Windows Defender, so that's probably legitimate. Chrome.exe is normal, but having multiple network connections might be a red flag if it's connecting to suspicious IPs, but the data here doesn't specify that. \n\nThen there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines here are a bit concerning. For example, the cmd.exe process has a command that adds a user to the domain with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and adds them to the Domain Admins group. That's a strong indicator of someone trying to escalate privileges or set up a backdoor. The user names and passwords look like they might be temporary or test credentials, but the act of adding a domain admin is serious.\n\nAnother cmd.exe instance runs \"net user\" and \"net group\" commands to add users and groups. These commands are typically used in administrative tasks, but without proper authorization, they could be part of a compromise. The presence of \"Domain Admins\" in the group name is especially worrying because that group has high privileges.\n\nLooking at the file events, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper, so that's normal. Another file created by powershell.exe is \"pacote_base.txt\" â€“ not sure what that is, but it's not immediately suspicious. The svchost.exe creating SRUtmp.log is a temporary file related to system resource usage tracking, so that's normal too.\n\nHowever, the key red flags here are the command-line arguments in the cmd.exe processes. Adding users to the Domain Admins group with specific passwords suggests an attempt to gain administrative access. This is a clear sign of potential malicious activity, even if the files created aren't obviously malicious. The combination of these commands with the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe, which are common in attack chains, makes this batch interesting for investigation.\n\nI should also check if there are any other suspicious activities. The repeated network connections from chrome.exe might be normal, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the user and group modifications are definitely suspicious. \n\nConfidence-wise, since there are clear indicators of privilege escalation attempts, I'd say the confidence is high, maybe around 0.85. The justification is the presence of commands adding domain admin users and groups, which is a strong sign of a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: (1) `cmd.exe` executing domain user creation and Domain Admins group addition with explicit credentials (potential privilege escalation). (2) `net1.exe` (likely a malicious variant of `net.exe`) used for domain user\/group manipulation. (3) PowerShell and cmd.exe process access events that could indicate post-exploitation activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a batch of four events in JSONL format. My job is to analyze them as a whole and determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. The first event is about svchost.exe creating a file at C:\\Windows\\System32\\sru\\SRUtmp.log. Wait, SRUtmp.log is part of the System Resource Usage tracking, which is a legitimate Windows system file. So svchost.exe creating that file might be normal. But I should check if there's any unusual activity here. Maybe the process is legitimate, so this might not be a problem.\n\nThe second event is winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipping tool, so creating a configuration file in the Downloads folder might be part of a setup or update. However, sometimes attackers might use similar names for malicious files. But just creating a config file isn't necessarily bad. Unless there's other suspicious activity, but I need to check the other events.\n\nThird and fourth events are both from powershell.exe. The third one is a registry value set, and the fourth is a process accessed. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. However, by itself, setting a registry value or accessing a process isn't necessarily malicious. But when combined with other events, it might indicate something. However, in this batch, the other events don't show obvious signs of compromise. \n\nNow, considering all events together. The first event is a legitimate system process creating a system file. The second is a legitimate tool creating a config file. The third and fourth are PowerShell activities that could be part of normal administrative tasks. There's no indication of unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or malicious payloads here. No unusual file paths, no unexpected processes, and no signs of data exfiltration or command execution. \n\nTherefore, the batch doesn't show any signs of malicious activity. The events are either normal or related to legitimate operations. The confidence is medium because while the events are not obviously suspicious, PowerShell activities can sometimes be a red flag. However, without additional context or more suspicious events, the classification is probably not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe) and common system activities (file creation, registry modification). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise detected across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
