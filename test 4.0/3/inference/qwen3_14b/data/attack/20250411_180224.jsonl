{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's powershell.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, and others. Now, PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but when combined with certain commands, it can be a red flag. Let me check the command lines.\n\nIn the second event, there's a cmd.exe command that uses schtasks to create a scheduled task. The command line includes running powershell.exe with -ep bypass and a script path. The script name is \"c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Wait, the file name has \"NonExistingScript\", which might be a typo or a way to hide the real script name. Also, using -ep bypass is a common technique to bypass execution policies, which is often seen in malicious activities.\n\nAnother event shows schtasks.exe creating a task named \"win32times\" with a similar command line. The scheduled task is set to run daily under the system account. That's unusual because scheduled tasks running as system might be part of a persistence mechanism, which is a common attack technique.\n\nThere's also a file created at \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times\", which is a scheduled task directory. Creating a task there could be part of setting up a persistent backdoor.\n\nOther events involve svchost.exe and chrome.exe with registry value sets. However, svchost.exe is a normal process, and chrome.exe having multiple registry events might not be suspicious on their own. But when combined with the other events, it's more about the scheduled tasks and PowerShell usage.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry events and the creation of a scheduled task with PowerShell suggests someone is trying to execute scripts with elevated privileges. Also, the non-existing script name might be a misdirection or a mistake, but the overall pattern is concerning.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators. The winlogbeat.exe creating a file is probably a normal log collection activity. The other events with chrome.exe might be benign, but the key here is the scheduled task creation and the PowerShell commands.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of creating a scheduled task with PowerShell, using bypassed execution policies, and the task running under the system account points to a potential security threat. This is enough to classify the batch as interesting for investigation. The confidence is high, maybe around 0.85, because there are multiple indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious activity: scheduled task creation with PowerShell execution bypass (-ep bypass), non-existent script paths, and registry modifications. The combination suggests potential persistence mechanism setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting. Let's go through each line.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, maybe part of an installation or configuration. Not suspicious yet.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe created 'entrada_ativo.txt'. PowerShell is common, but creating a file could be normal. However, sometimes attackers use PowerShell for malicious activities. Not sure yet.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe had a process accessed. The file is None, which might mean the event is about the process itself, not a file. Maybe a process access without a file involved. Not immediately harmful.\n\nFourth event: whoami.exe was executed. This is a standard tool to check user context. Common in legitimate scenarios, like scripts checking permissions. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nFifth event: another ProcessAccess by powershell.exe. Again, no file mentioned. Maybe the same process being accessed again.\n\nPutting it all together: There's no clear malicious activity. The events include normal processes creating files and accessing processes. No signs of malware, unexpected network activity, or privilege escalation. The files created are in user directories, which is typical. The presence of whoami.exe is normal. However, the repeated ProcessAccess events might be worth noting, but without more context, they don't indicate a threat. So, probably not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard process activities (file creation by legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe, and process access events) without indicators of compromise or suspicious behavior. No malicious artifacts or anomalous patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
