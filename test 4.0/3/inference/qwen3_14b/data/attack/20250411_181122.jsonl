So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: 'whoami.exe' is executed. That's a normal command to get the current user, so probably benign. Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. \n\nLooking at the command line in one of the events: the user is using 'findstr' and 'select-string' to search for 'password' in various file types. This could be part of a script that's trying to find credentials in files. But wait, the command line is a bit odd. The 'findstr' command is followed by 'ls -R' which seems like a mix of different shells. Maybe that's a typo or a mistake in the log? Also, the use of 'select-string' with '-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue' might be to suppress errors, which is common in scripts to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell, but the presence of 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender might be a red flag. However, that's part of the system's antivirus, so maybe it's just a legitimate process. \n\nThe 'File created' and 'File Delete logged' events show a temporary script file being created and then deleted. This is a common tactic used by malware to execute scripts and then clean up. The fact that the file is in the Temp directory and is deleted afterward could indicate an attempt to hide activities.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the same command line might indicate that the script is being executed multiple times or that there's some logging or lifecycle management happening. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of PowerShell executing commands that search for passwords in files, combined with the creation and deletion of a temporary script, might be signs of a script trying to extract sensitive information. However, since the user is using standard commands and the events don't show obvious malicious activity like downloading files or connecting to external IPs, it's a bit ambiguous. But the repeated use of PowerShell for such searches and the cleanup of the script file could be suspicious. I'd lean towards 'INTERESTING' but with moderate confidence because while some activities are normal, the combination might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to search for passwords in files, combined with temporary script file creation\/deletion, suggests potential credential harvesting activity.

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: there's a PowerShell command using findstr and select-string to search for 'pass' and 'password' in various file types. That seems like someone is trying to find passwords in files. That's a red flag. But maybe it's a legitimate search? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's normal. Notepad and svchost.exe modifying registry values. Not sure if that's bad. The calc.exe and urlmon.dll being loadedâ€”urlmon is part of Windows, so that's probably normal. \n\nWait, there's a PowerShell process that's running the same command again. The command is searching for passwords in files. If this is part of a script, maybe it's a data exfiltration attempt. Also, the fact that the same command appears multiple times might indicate it's being run repeatedly, which could be malicious.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a lot of registry changes and process accesses, but nothing too alarming. The Chrome events are probably normal. However, the repeated PowerShell commands searching for passwords might be indicative of an attacker trying to gather credentials. \n\nBut I should check if there are other signs. The file created by winlogbeat might be part of a log collection, which is normal. The other processes like OfficeClickToRun and svchost are standard. However, the repeated use of PowerShell to search for passwords could be a sign of malicious activity. \n\nIs there any other event that stands out? The 'findstr' process is being created, which is a legitimate tool, but when combined with PowerShell scripts, it might be used for malicious purposes. The fact that the same command is executed multiple times under different tasks (Engine Lifecycle, Provider Lifecycle) might be suspicious. \n\nAlso, the user might be trying to find sensitive information. The confidence here is a bit high, but I need to make sure there's no other benign explanation. Maybe it's a script that's part of a legitimate audit. However, without more context, the repeated searches for passwords and the use of PowerShell in that way are concerning. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think this batch is interesting. The justification is the repeated use of PowerShell to search for passwords in files, which could indicate an attempt to find sensitive information.

There's also an entry where winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. Then there's a powershell.exe creating a file called objeto_logico.txt. \n\nWait, the main thing here is that chrome.exe is doing a lot of activities. Normally, chrome might do DNS queries and network connections, but setting registry values multiple times could be suspicious. However, I should check if these are normal operations. Also, the file created by winlogbeat seems like a legitimate log file, maybe part of a setup. The powershell creating a text file might be normal too, but sometimes that's used for malicious purposes. \n\nBut looking at all the events, most are from chrome.exe. The repetition of registry value sets might not be a red flag if it's part of normal operation. However, the presence of multiple registry changes and network connections could indicate something. But since there's no mention of any suspicious files being accessed or unusual processes, maybe it's not a threat. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the batch is interesting. The key here is that all events are from chrome.exe and related to normal activities. Unless there's a specific pattern that's known malicious, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The only other events are from winlogbeat and powershell, which are common. \n\nHmm, maybe the high number of registry events from chrome is unusual. But I'm not sure.

But then there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe, which is often used in attacks. There's also whoami.exe, which could be benign but sometimes used in malicious scripts. \n\nLooking at the commands, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes scheduled tasks using schtasks. Deleting tasks might be suspicious, especially if it's part of removing logs or payloads. There are several instances of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks related to powershell.exe and cmd.exe. \n\nThe repeated use of schtasks.exe to delete tasks could indicate someone trying to clean up after themselves. Also, the Registry value changes might suggest persistence mechanisms. However, some of these entries are just normal system processes. \n\nBut the key points here are the multiple deletions of scheduled tasks and the frequent access to processes and registry changes by powershell.exe.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: cmd.exe is running a command to delete notepad.exe processes using wmic. That seems suspicious because deleting processes isn't normal. Then there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe accessing processes and registry changes. The next few lines show WMIC.exe loading various DLLs, including some from Windows Defender. That might be a red flag because loading amsi.dll or MpOAV.dll could be part of evasion techniques. \n\nThen there's a lot of registry value set events, which could indicate changes to system settings or attempts to disable security features. The command to delete users with net user \/del is another concerning activity, especially if it's removing admin accounts. Also, the presence of net1.exe, which isn't a standard Windows tool, might be a typo or a malicious binary.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a pattern of process creation, registry modifications, and attempts to delete user accounts. The use of WMIC and PowerShell for these actions, along with loading suspicious DLLs, points towards potential malicious activity. However, some of these could be legitimate if, for example, the user is performing system maintenance. But the combination of deleting processes, modifying registry, and deleting user accounts is more indicative of a security incident. I should check if the confidence is high enough.

Now, PowerShell is common, but when combined with certain commands, it can be a red flag. Let me check the command lines. There's one entry where cmd.exe is used with \"net user modulo_auxiliar_Admin >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\". That looks like a command to delete a user account in a domain. Similarly, there's another cmd.exe command trying to delete \"pacote_auxiliar_Admin\" and \"tarefa_padrao_Admin\" users. Deleting user accounts isn't inherently bad, but if it's done without proper authorization or in an unusual context, it could be a sign of compromise.\n\nThen there's the use of \"sc delete win32times\" which is attempting to delete a service named win32times. Deleting services might be part of a cleanup after an attack. Also, there are multiple instances of registry value changes and process accesses. The combination of these actionsâ€”modifying the registry, deleting user accounts, and removing servicesâ€”could indicate an attacker trying to persist or cover their tracks.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries related to User Account Management and Security Group Management. While these are normal administrative tasks, the frequency and combination with other suspicious commands might point to a larger issue. The presence of multiple deletions and registry modifications without clear justification could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these might be legitimate administrative tasks. But given the lack of context and the repetitive nature of the commands (deleting users and services), it's more likely that this is a security incident.

Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes with tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. The next event is 'cmd.exe' trying to delete files in the Temp directory. That's suspicious because deleting temporary files might be part of cleanup, but combined with other activities, it could be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' being accessed and registry values being set. Then, there's a 'cmd.exe' event that deletes a specific file: 'tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe'. The name of the file includes 'calc_decoded', which might be related to a payload or malware. Deleting such a file could be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nThen, there are several entries with 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks, which might be part of PowerShell's normal operation, but the repetition could indicate something automated. Also, the 'Image loaded' events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll are normal for PowerShell running scripts, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that might be a problem.\n\nPutting it all together: the deletion of files in the Temp directory, especially with names that include 'calc_decoded', along with multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe activities, might indicate an attacker trying to execute and then clean up after themselves.

But the combination of file deletion and multiple PowerShell activities raises suspicion.

There are also a few entries for whoami.exe and winlogbeat.exe. \n\nStarting with the PowerShell events. The first few entries show Image loaded for system files like mscorlib.ni.dll and clrjit.dll.

The command line for one PowerShell instance is \"& {}\", which is an empty command. That might be a sign of obfuscation or a placeholder. \n\nThere are multiple Process accessed events for PowerShell, which could indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's whoami.exe, powershell.exe, svchost.exe, chrome.exe, etc. Whoami is a standard command to get user info, so that's normal. Powershell is commonly used, but if it's being accessed a lot, maybe that's a red flag. Wait, there are multiple entries for Process accessed (ProcessAccess) for powershell.exe. But is that unusual? Maybe not on its own.\n\nThen there's the Image loaded events. Both calc.exe and Calculator.exe (note the capitalization difference) loaded urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but why is it being loaded by calculator? That might be normal, but maybe if it's from an unexpected path. However, the path here is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the standard location. So that might not be a problem.\n\nAnother thing is the file creation event for winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so if it's creating a new configuration file, that could be part of normal operation. But the file path is in the Downloads directory. Maybe that's okay if it's a user-installed tool, but sometimes attackers might use similar names. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the registry events: svchost.exe and others setting registry values. That's common for system processes, so not necessarily malicious. The chrome.exe events include DNS queries and network connections, which are normal for a browser.\n\nNow, considering the repetition. There are several instances of powershell.exe being accessed, but again, that's common. The whoami.exe executions are normal. The only thing that stands out a bit is the ImageLoad events for calculator and calc.exe. Wait, why are both calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll? Maybe that's a typo, but maybe it's the same process. Also, the capitalization difference might be a red herring. It could be that the logs are from different times or different instances, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nAnother point: the presence of winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file. That's part of configuration updates, but if the user didn't initiate it, that might be suspicious. However, without more context on the environment, it's hard to tell. Maybe the user is just installing or updating winlogbeat.\n\nOverall, the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. They seem to be normal system processes and legitimate activities. The repetition of certain events might be due to normal operations. There's no indication of unauthorized access, suspicious network activity, or unusual file modifications. So, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING.
