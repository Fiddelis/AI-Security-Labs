{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. Hmm, there's a lot of activity here. First, I notice multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and processes being created. Then there's a command line in one of the entries that stands out: \"sc create win32times binPath= \"cmd \/c start c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\"\". Wait, the script path is \"NonExistingScript.ps1\", which suggests that the file might not actually exist. That's suspicious because creating a service that points to a non-existent script could be an attempt to execute malicious code later.\n\nAlso, there's a line where \"sc.exe\" is used to create a service with a binPath that includes starting a PowerShell script. Even though the script isn't found, the act of creating a service with such a command is red flag. Services are usually legitimate, but creating one with a command that runs a script might be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking further, there are several registry value set events. While some registry changes are normal, the combination with the service creation and the non-existent script makes me think there's an attempt to modify system settings or inject code. Also, the image loaded events for urlmon.dll might be normal, but if that's part of a larger attack, it could be a way to execute code.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated registry events from services.exe and svchost.exe. That might indicate some kind of system manipulation. Plus, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory could be part of data exfiltration or configuration changes, though that's not as directly malicious as the service creation.\n\nPutting this all together, the key suspicious points are the service creation with a non-existent PowerShell script and the multiple registry modifications. Even though some entries are normal, the combination here points towards potential malicious activity. The confidence is high enough to classify this as interesting, but not 100% certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Creation of a service (win32times) with a binPath pointing to a non-existent PowerShell script (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1), suggesting potential malicious payload execution. 2) Repeated registry modification events across system processes (services.exe, svchost.exe, cmd.exe) indicating possible system configuration tampering. 3) Unusual process access patterns with powershell.exe and cmd.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe. The winlog tasks include Registry value set, Process accessed, Pipe Created, and Image loaded. The files mentioned are amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are related to Windows Defender.\n\nNow, Registry value set events are common, but when combined with other events, they might indicate something. The ImageLoad events for chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are interesting. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process like chrome.exe is loading these DLLs, that's normal. But maybe there's something else here.\n\nWait, but the events show that chrome.exe is loading these DLLs. However, the paths are C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll and C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform... which are legitimate paths. So that's expected. However, the repeated Registry value set events for chrome.exe might be normal too, unless they're modifying critical keys. But the data here doesn't specify which registry keys are being modified. \n\nThen there's the ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. Process access can be normal, but if it's accessing other processes in a suspicious way, that's a red flag. However, the data here doesn't specify which processes are being accessed. \n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple registry events, some image loads, and process access. However, all the processes mentioned are common ones (like chrome, powershell), and the files loaded are legitimate. There's no indication of unusual activity like unexpected network connections, file creations, or privilege escalations. \n\nSo maybe this isn't suspicious. The classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events don't show signs of malicious behavior. The confidence is around 0.7 because while some events are common, the lack of specific indicators (like unexpected registry changes or malicious files) reduces the likelihood. However, if there were more details, like specific registry keys or unexpected processes, it might be different. But with the given data, it's not a clear threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve common processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe) and legitimate system activities (registry modifications, image loading of Windows Defender DLLs). No clear indicators of malicious behavior or anomalies detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
