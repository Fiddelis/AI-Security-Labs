{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe doing a DNS query, MpDefenderCoreService.exe having a network connection, and chrome.exe doing similar things. Those seem normal. Chrome and svchost are common processes, and DNS queries and network connections are typical. Not a red flag here.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe command, which is usually used to check the current user. But it's a legitimate tool, so maybe not suspicious on its own. However, looking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that adds a user to the domain with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and adds them to the Domain Admins group. That's a big red flag. Creating domain admin accounts is a serious security issue. The command line shows adding a user with a temporary password, which might be part of an attack to gain admin privileges.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of net.exe and net1.exe being used to add users and groups. The use of \"net1.exe\" instead of the standard \"net.exe\" might be a typo or a malicious replacement. The paths and commands here are concerning because adding users to Domain Admins is a high-privilege action that shouldn't be happening without proper authorization.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation event for a .yml.new file and a pacote_base.txt. While file creation is normal, the context here might be that these files are part of an attack payload or configuration. However, the main issue is the unauthorized user and group modifications.\n\nThe confidence here is high because creating domain admin accounts and modifying group memberships are clear indicators of a potential security breach. The presence of these commands in the logs suggests that someone is trying to escalate privileges on the network. Even though some processes are legitimate (like chrome and svchost), the specific commands executed by cmd.exe and net.exe are highly suspicious. The justification is the unauthorized addition of domain admin users and the use of potentially malicious commands.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: unauthorized domain user creation (e.g., 'pacote_principal_Admin' added to Domain Admins with weak password), use of 'net1.exe' (likely malicious variant of 'net.exe'), and potential privilege escalation attempts through command-line operations. These indicate possible lateral movement or privilege escalation attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is svchost.exe creating a file in the System32\\sru directory. SRUtmp.log is part of the System Resource Usage tracking, so that might be normal. But svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but sometimes malware hides there.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for logging, but the .new extension might indicate a temporary file. However, if the user is installing or configuring it, this could be normal. But maybe the path is unusual or the file is being created in an unexpected way.\n\nThen there's PowerShell setting a registry value. PowerShell is common for administrative tasks, but if it's changing registry keys that aren't typical for normal operations, that could be suspicious. The third event is ProcessAccess by PowerShell. Accessing processes is normal, but if it's accessing processes that are not usually accessed, that might be a red flag.\n\nLooking at all together: The first event might be benign. The second could be part of a setup. But the registry change and process access by PowerShell might indicate someone trying to modify system settings or access sensitive processes. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys or processes accessed, it's hard to tell. The confidence is moderate. Maybe the combination of these events is not highly suspicious, but there's enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell executing registry modifications and process access, alongside file creation by svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe. While some processes are legitimate, the combination of actions may indicate potential reconnaissance or configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
