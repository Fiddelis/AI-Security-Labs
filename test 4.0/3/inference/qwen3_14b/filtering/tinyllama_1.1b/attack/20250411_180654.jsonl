{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file called objeto_temporario.txt in the Downloads folder. That's a temporary file, maybe normal, but not sure yet. Then there's a Process accessed event, but no file involved. Then chrome.exe has some registry value sets. Multiple entries of chrome.exe doing the same thing—maybe normal browsing, but repeated registry changes could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking further, there's a process create event for powershell.exe with a command line that includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script name sounds suspicious. Keystrokes often relate to keyloggers, which are malicious. The log path is set to $env:TEMP\\key.log, which is a common place for malware to store data. Also, there are multiple instances of similar command lines with different paths but the same script name. That repetition might indicate an attempt to execute the same malicious script from various locations, possibly to evade detection.\n\nThen there are Image Load events for clr.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are part of .NET and Windows Defender. Those are legitimate, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, it might be a sign. However, the presence of these DLLs alone isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThe File created and then immediately deleted event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 could be part of a script execution that's trying to clean up after itself. That's a common tactic for malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be related to inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe multiple instances of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 being executed from different paths suggest that the attacker is trying to run the same malicious script from various locations, possibly to bypass security measures that monitor specific directories. The script's purpose is clear—it's capturing keystrokes, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent.\n\nConsidering all these points, the presence of the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script being executed multiple times, along with file creation and deletion in temporary directories, points towards a potential security threat. Even though some events are normal (like chrome.exe registry changes or legitimate DLLs being loaded), the combination of these specific PowerShell activities is concerning. The confidence is high because the keylogger script is a clear indicator of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in TEMP directories, indicating potential keylogging activity. File creation\/deletion in temporary directories and repeated execution of suspicious scripts suggest malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}

The user wants me to analyze the batch as a whole and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each line. The first event has a process running powershell.exe with a command line that includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a script that captures keystrokes and saves them to a log file in the TEMP directory. That seems suspicious because keystroke logging is often associated with malware or keyloggers. The winlog task here is 'Engine Lifecycle', which I'm not too familiar with, but the file path mentioned is in a temporary directory, which might be a red flag.\n\nThe second event has a file created at 'C:\\elemento_comum\\registro_principal\\elemento_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1'. The same script name appears again here. The winlog task is 'Execute a Remote Command', which could indicate that the script was executed remotely. This is another point of concern because executing scripts from remote locations can be part of an attack.\n\nThe third event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and forwarding logs, so this might be normal activity. The file path is in the Downloads directory, which is common for user-installed software. This seems less suspicious.\n\nThe fourth event is powershell.exe creating a file named 'pacote_temporario.txt'. The task is 'File created', but without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious. However, creating files via PowerShell can be part of both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nThe fifth event involves svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization directory. Svchost.exe is a standard Windows process, and the file path is part of a system service. This seems like normal system behavior, so probably not a threat.\n\nPutting it all together, the first two events involve the same malicious-looking script, Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is used for keystroke logging. The presence of this script in two different events, especially with the remote execution task, suggests potential malicious activity. The other events don't show any obvious signs of compromise. However, the confidence isn't 100% because some events could be benign. But the combination of the keylogger script and remote execution is a strong indicator. So, I think the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involve the suspicious script 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' associated with keystroke logging, combined with a 'Execute a Remote Command' task, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
