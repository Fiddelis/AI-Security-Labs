So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple process accesses and registry value sets by powershell.exe. That's common, but not necessarily bad. Then there's a process create event with a command line that includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script name sounds like it could be used for keystroke logging, which is often associated with malware. The log path is set to $env:TEMP\\key.log, which is a temporary directoryâ€”common for malware to store data temporarily.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances of the same Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script being executed from different paths. The fact that it's being called multiple times from various directories might indicate an attempt to evade detection by changing locations. Also, the command line syntax uses & {&\\\"...\\\"}, which is a way to execute scripts in PowerShell, sometimes used in malicious contexts.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is deleted: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1. Deleting a temporary script could be an attempt to remove evidence. Also, the File created events for StartupProfileData-NonInteractive might be related to setting up persistence or configuration files.\n\nAnother point is the execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 from different paths multiple times. This repetition could be part of a larger attack, trying to ensure the script runs even if some paths are blocked. The presence of this script in multiple locations suggests it's being distributed or executed in a way that's trying to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where the process is None, but the file path is given. That might be a log from a different source, but the script name again is Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That's consistent with the other entries, reinforcing the idea that this is a coordinated activity.\n\nThe other events involve winlogbeat and svchost.exe creating files, which seem normal. But the focus here is on the repeated PowerShell activities. The key indicators are the use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, the multiple executions from different paths, the deletion of a temporary script, and the logging to a temporary directory. These are all signs that could indicate malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or keystroke logging.\n\nConfidence-wise, the repeated patterns and the presence of the keystroke logging script make this suspicious. However, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack yet, so maybe around 0.8 confidence. But since the logs show multiple attempts and the use of a known malicious script name, it's leaning towards INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' from various paths with temporary log files, suggesting potential keystroke logging or data exfiltration attempts. Repeated execution patterns and file operations (creation\/deletion) indicate suspicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these two events. The first one involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a known tool for collecting Windows event logs, so this might be part of its normal operation when setting up configuration files. The second event is about powershell.exe creating a file called entrada_padrao.txt. PowerShell is a common administrative tool, and creating a text file isn't inherently suspicious.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's any malicious behavior here. The first event's file path seems typical for a configuration file, and the process is legitimate. The second event's file name doesn't look like anything malicious. There's no mention of unusual processes, unexpected network activity, or other signs of compromise. Both events are about file creation, which is normal for these tools. Since there's no indication of malicious activity or anomalies in the events provided, the classification should be NOT INTERESTING. The confidence is medium because while the events are normal, without more context, it's hard to be certain, but there's no red flags here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Both events involve legitimate processes (winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe) creating files in user download directories, which are common operations for configuration and temporary files.
