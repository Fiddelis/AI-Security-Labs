First, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first event: whoami.exe is run. That's a normal command to get the current user, so not suspicious on its own. But then there's a powershell.exe process that runs a command to search for files with 'pass' in various extensions. The command uses findstr and select-string to look for passwords in files. That seems like a potential security risk because it's searching for sensitive information. \n\nNext, there are several entries about powershell.exe with tasks like Process Create, Process Access, Image Load, and File Create\/Delete. The file created is a temporary script file, which is then deleted. That could be part of a script that's executed and then cleaned up, which is common in malicious activities. \n\nThe same command line is repeated multiple times in the Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks. That might indicate that the PowerShell command is being logged multiple times, perhaps due to some automation or repeated execution. \n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which is a log shipper. However, the rest of the events are mostly about PowerShell activities. The presence of multiple PowerShell commands searching for passwords, combined with the creation and deletion of temporary files, might suggest an attempt to find and exfiltrate sensitive data. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any indication of actual malicious activity. The commands are searching for passwords, which could be part of a legitimate script, but the repetition and the cleanup of the temporary file might be suspicious. Also, the involvement of Windows Defender's DLLs in image loads might be normal, but combined with other events, it's worth looking into. \n\nThe classification here would depend on whether the activities are benign or suspicious. Since the PowerShell command is searching for passwords in files, which is a common technique used in data exfiltration, and the temporary script is created and deleted, this could be a red flag. However, without more context like network activity or actual data exfiltration, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nConsidering the repeated commands and the file operations, I think this is interesting enough to warrant investigation. The confidence is around 0.75 because while the activities are not definitively malicious, they exhibit patterns commonly associated with malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to search for password-related patterns in files, combined with temporary script creation\/deletion and repeated event logging, suggest potential data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: OfficeClickToRun.exe doing a DNS query. That's a legitimate process from Microsoft, so maybe not a problem. But I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command that's searching for passwords in various file types. The command line looks like it's trying to find 'password' in files. That's a bit suspicious because it might be part of a password-gathering activity. But is that enough on its own? Maybe not, but combined with other events?\n\nThen, there's a FileCreated event for a PowerShell startup profile. That could be normal, but sometimes attackers use startup scripts to persist. Not sure yet.\n\nChrome.exe has several events: DNS queries, registry changes, image loaded (like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll). Those are legitimate system files, so maybe just normal Chrome behavior. But multiple registry value sets might indicate some configuration changes, though not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event is creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe it's just doing its job. The file path seems normal, but maybe the presence of a new config file is worth noting.\n\nThen there's a series of PowerShell and cmd.exe processes, including deleting scheduled tasks. The command lines show deletion of tasks named things like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks could be part of cleaning up after an attack, which is suspicious. Also, the use of schtasks.exe to delete tasks might be normal, but combined with other activities?\n\nThe WMIC.exe command is deleting notepad.exe processes. That's odd. Why would someone delete notepad.exe? Maybe trying to remove a process that's being used for something else, like a backdoor or a payload.\n\nPutting this all together: the PowerShell command searching for passwords, deleting scheduled tasks, and the WMIC command deleting processes might indicate an attacker trying to gather information and then clean up traces. However, some of these could be legitimate, like a user trying to remove old tasks or test scripts. But the combination of searching for passwords and deleting processes might be more indicative of malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because some actions are normal, but there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell command searching for passwords in files, deletion of scheduled tasks, and WMIC process deletion.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The first event is about WMIC.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That seems odd because Windows Defender's files shouldn't be loaded by WMIC, which is often used by attackers. Then there are multiple instances of cmd.exe and net.exe deleting user accounts, which is suspicious. The use of net1.exe instead of net.exe might be a red flag, as it's not a standard tool. There's also sc.exe deleting a service called win32times, which could be an attempt to remove a malicious service. The repeated use of powershell.exe and process access events might indicate someone trying to maintain persistence or execute commands. The command lines have obfuscation with quotes and redirection of output to nul, which is common in attacks to hide activity. The combination of these events—loading a DLL from a defender folder, deleting user accounts, deleting services, and using obfuscated commands—points to a potential attack. However, some of these could be legitimate if, for example, a script is cleaning up temporary files. But the presence of multiple suspicious actions across different processes and the use of non-standard tools like net1.exe make me think this is a security incident.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I should look through all the events to see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a File Delete logged for a file in the Temp directory: tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe. That might be normal, but sometimes malicious files are deleted after execution. Then there are multiple entries for powershell.exe with various tasks like Process Create, Process Access, Image Load. The Image Load events mention loading DLLs from Windows Defender and .NET Framework, which seems legitimate. However, there's a File Create and then immediate File Delete for a PowerShell script in the Temp folder. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting a script quickly might be part of an attack to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there are several instances of whoami.exe being executed, which is a normal command to check user context, but if done repeatedly, it might be part of reconnaissance. The conhost.exe and registry events don't seem too suspicious. However, the combination of creating and deleting a script, along with multiple PowerShell activities, might indicate someone trying to run scripts and clean up afterward. The presence of decoded.exe in the Temp folder could be a sign of a downloaded malicious file. But I need to check if all these events are just normal user activity or if there's a pattern suggesting malicious behavior. Since there's no clear evidence of exploitation or unauthorized access, but the file creation and deletion might be worth investigating further. So, I think this is interesting enough to warrant an investigation, maybe a medium confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell-related events with file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, along with image loading of potentially legitimate but contextually suspicious DLLs, suggest possible malicious activity or script execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each line.\n\nFirst event: calc.exe loaded urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate process, but maybe if it's doing something unusual. But urlmon.dll is part of Windows, so maybe normal.\n\nSecond event: Calculator.exe loading the same dll. Similar to the first, maybe a typo in the name? But still, same file path. Not sure yet.\n\nThird event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. The file path seems like a typical installation path. Maybe not suspicious.\n\nFourth: powershell.exe process accessed, but no file involved. Not sure what that means. Maybe a process access event without a file could be normal or could be part of something else.\n\nThen chrome.exe has DNS queries and network connections. Multiple entries here. Chrome doing DNS lookups and network connections is normal behavior. But if there were unusual domains or IPs, that would be a red flag. However, the events don't specify any particular domains or IPs, just the rule names.\n\nLooking at all together, most events are related to normal processes. The first two might be benign, but maybe the Calculator.exe is a typo for something else? But the file path is correct. The winlogbeat event is part of normal operations. The chrome events are standard. The powershell event is a bit unclear but without more context, not enough to flag.\n\nNo obvious signs of malicious activity. No unexpected files, no unusual network behavior mentioned. So maybe this isn't interesting. But I should check if any of the events are out of place. For example, if a legitimate process is loading a dll from an unexpected location, but here the paths are all standard.\n\nSo the classification is probably NOT INTERESTING. The justification is that all events are related to normal user activities and legitimate processes without any signs of malicious behavior. Confidence around 0.7 because while most are normal, the powershell event might need more context, but without additional info, it's not enough to flag.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (calc.exe, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe) performing normal operations (DLL loading, DNS queries, file creation) without signs of malicious activity or anomalies.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
