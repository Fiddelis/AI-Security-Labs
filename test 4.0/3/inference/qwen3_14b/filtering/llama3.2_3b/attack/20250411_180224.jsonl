Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: it's a process creation for cmd.exe with a command line that includes schtasks creating a scheduled task. The task is set to run daily under the system account, and the trigger is a PowerShell script that's supposed to run. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the name has \"NonExistingScript\" in it. That might be a red flag because the script doesn't exist, which could indicate a failed attempt or a typo. But maybe the attacker is trying to hide the real script name.\n\nNext, the second event is another process creation for schtasks.exe with similar parameters. The command line here is creating a scheduled task with the same name, \"win32times\", and the same PowerShell script path, but the filename is slightly different: \"entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Again, the \"NonExistingScript\" part is suspicious. It's possible that the attacker is trying to create a scheduled task that runs a non-existent script, which might be a way to avoid detection or maybe a mistake.\n\nThen there are a few events where schtasks.exe is loaded as an image, which is normal since it's a legitimate Windows utility. The file path is the standard System32\\taskschd.dll, so that's expected.\n\nAnother event shows cmd.exe with a registry value set. Not sure about the significance here, but registry changes can be part of malware activities. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere are events related to winlogbeat.exe creating files, which might be part of log collection. The files created are .yml.new files, which could be configuration files. Similarly, powershell.exe creating text files in the Downloads directory. These might be benign if the user is manually creating files, but combined with other events, they could be part of a larger scheme.\n\nThe chrome.exe events involve registry value sets. Multiple times, but chrome.exe modifying the registry isn't necessarily malicious, though it's worth noting.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is a standard command to check the current user, which is a common legitimate activity. However, if used in the context of other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious points are the creation of scheduled tasks that reference non-existent PowerShell scripts. Scheduled tasks running under the system account with daily triggers are a red flag. The use of \"-ep bypass\" in the PowerShell command is a known technique to bypass execution policies, which is often used by malware. Even though the scripts don't exist, the attempt to create such tasks is suspicious. The repetition of similar commands with slightly different script names might indicate an attacker trying different approaches or a script that's being modified. The other events, like file creations and registry changes, could be part of the attacker's setup or unrelated. However, without more evidence, the scheduled task creation is the most concerning part. The confidence is medium because while the events are suspicious, they could be part of a legitimate process if the scripts are later created or if there's a misconfiguration. But given the non-existent script names and the use of bypass, it's leaning towards interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show attempts to create scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe with PowerShell commands that reference non-existent scripts (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), which is suspicious. The use of '-ep bypass' to bypass PowerShell execution policies and the recurring task name 'win32times' suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
