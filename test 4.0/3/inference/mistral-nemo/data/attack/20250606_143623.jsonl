{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"It seems like there's a sequence of events happening on your system, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Process Creates and Registry Events:**\n   - `services.exe`: A Windows service process created.\n   - `sppsvc.exe` loaded `taskschd.dll`.\n   - `svchost.exe`: Another Windows service process created.\n\n2. **Windows Update Agent:** This is a normal activity as Windows periodically checks for updates.\n\n3. **PowerShell Activities:**\n   - A PowerShell script was executed multiple times (6 instances) with the following command:\n     ```\n     powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\"; Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n     ```\n   - This script does the following:\n     1. Creates a new Windows service named `\"objeto_ativo\"` with the binary path set to `\"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\"`.\n     2. Starts the newly created service.\n\n4. **Provider and Engine Lifecycle:** These are typical events related to the operation of Windows Defender's real-time protection engine.\n\nHowever, there are a few points that might warrant further investigation:\n\n- The PowerShell script was executed multiple times in quick succession. This could indicate an attempt to create a new service repeatedly, which is unusual behavior.\n- The service name `\"objeto_ativo\"` and the path to the binary `tarefa_logico.exe` suggest that this might be related to some form of malicious activity or unwanted software.\n\nI would recommend running a full system scan using your preferred antivirus software to ensure there are no malicious programs on your computer. Additionally, you might want to review any recent changes to your system or installed programs to see if anything stands out."}
