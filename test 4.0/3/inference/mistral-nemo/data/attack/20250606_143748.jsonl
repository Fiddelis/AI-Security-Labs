The repeated attempts (10 times) indicate that the attack was not successful on the first try, potentially due to security measures in place or lack of required privileges.\n\nTo investigate further:\n\n- Check if there are any related events such as file creation\/deletion, network connections, or process termination around the timestamps of these events.\n- Inspect the `WinPwn.ps1` script to understand its capabilities and potential impact.\n- Monitor for any unusual user account activities, especially those involving privileged accounts.\n- Review logs for any indications of successful execution of the WinPwn script or other suspicious activities after these event timestamps."}
