{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided JSON data, here's a structured analysis and an interesting finding:\n\n**Structured Analysis:**\n\n- All events (21 in total) have the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\".\n- The Windows event log task for all events is \"File created (rule FileCreate)\".\n- The file paths are all located under:\n  ```\n  C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n  ```\n- The filenames are in the format \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js\".\n- Each filename contains a unique hash value (confirmed by comparing hashes).\n\n**Interesting Finding:**\n\nAll events represent the creation of JavaScript files with varying hashes. Since these files are created repeatedly and all have unique hashes, it suggests that they might be related to dynamic content generation or updates for the \"Office Add-in Helper\" process (SDXHelper.exe). Here's a hypothesis:\n\n- The \"SDXHelper.exe\" process could be an Office add-in helper that generates or fetches updated JavaScript files based on some dynamic conditions (like user preferences, environment variables, etc.).\n- The unique hashes in the filenames might represent versions of these JavaScript files, and their creation could indicate updates to the Office add-in's functionality.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact reason for these events. Monitoring further events or checking if these files have any effect on system performance or user experience would help determine if this is normal behavior or a potential issue."}
