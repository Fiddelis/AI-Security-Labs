The files created are JavaScript files with names starting with \"excel-copilot-strings_\", suggesting they might be related to Office 365 or Microsoft Excel, and possibly involving some form of localization or language resources.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n- **Threat Level:** Low. While the process appears to create many files, it doesn't necessarily indicate a threat unless further context shows otherwise.\n- **Recommendation:** Monitor the behavior for any unusual patterns or impacts on system performance. If no other suspicious activities are observed, this could be considered normal behavior for an Office-related process.\n\n**Justification:**\n\n1. The process is related to Microsoft Office, which is a legitimate software suite used by many organizations and individuals.\n2. The files created appear to be JavaScript files, which could indicate localization resources or other non-threatening data processing tasks.\n3. There's no evidence of any malicious activities such as file overwrites, system changes, network communication, etc., in these logs.\n4.

The process involved is Microsoft's Script Debugging for Windows (SDXHelper.exe), suggesting these files might be used within a debugging or development context.\n2. The filenames contain hashes, which typically indicate that the files are precompiled or optimized for performance.\n3.

The common fields in these objects are:\n\n- `process.name`: The name of the process involved in the task. In this case, all objects share the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\".\n- `winlog.task`: The type of task recorded in the Windows event log. Here, it's consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\".\n- `file.path`: The path to the file associated with the task. These paths refer to files named \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a unique hexadecimal string, suggesting that these are different versions or variations of the same file type.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nIn summary, the SDXHelper process created numerous files with names starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\", followed by unique hexadecimal strings. These files were created based on a rule for file creation tasks recorded in the Windows event log."}

These files are all JavaScript (.js) files located in either \"OfflineFiles\" folder of \"PackageResources\" subfolder within \"SolutionPackages\" folders under \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\ClientX86\" directory. The filenames suggest they are related to Microsoft Office's AI copilot features for Word and potentially other Office applications.\n\n**Interesting Points:**\n\n1. The process SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple JavaScript files, suggesting some kind of dynamic script generation or update.\n2. The presence of \"word-copilot.min_\" files indicates that the files are related to Microsoft Word's AI copilot feature.\n3. The occurrence of both \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" and \"word-copilot.min_\" files in close proximity might imply a correlation between the two, possibly indicating an update or interaction between the general Office AI copilot and the Word-specific feature.\n\n**Potential Concern:**\n\nWhile these events could be normal behavior for dynamic script generation\/update, they could also potentially indicate unwanted activity such as malware infection or unauthorized software behavior. However, without additional context or more detailed analysis, it's difficult to determine if this is a cause for concern.\n\n**Suggestion:**\n\nFurther investigation into the purpose and origin of SDXHelper.exe would be beneficial to determine whether its activities are legitimate and expected, or if they indicate an issue that requires further attention."}
