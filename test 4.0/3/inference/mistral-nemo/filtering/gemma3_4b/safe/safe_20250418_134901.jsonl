This happened multiple times.\n   - Setup.exe created a temporary file: `C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp\\b8d633a2-08f3-4e51-85c3-3602fa580c63.tmp`.\n\n3. **Registry Activities:**\n   - Many registry value sets and registry object adds\/deletes were detected, primarily by `svchost.exe` and `chrome.exe`. These activities are typical for system and browser processes.\n   - Some examples include:\n     - `svchost.exe`: Set registry values under HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services multiple times.\n     - `chrome.exe`: Set registry values under HKU\\S-1-5-21-2780369465-3478682006-2836215146-500.\n\n4. **Network Activities:**\n   - `chrome.exe` performed a DNS query (DnsQuery).\n\n5. **Other Activities:**\n   - Image loaded events were detected for `taskschd.dll` by `sppsvc.exe`, and `urlmon.dll` by `notepad.exe`. These are common DLL files used by Windows.\n\n6. **User Account Management:**\n   - One event related to user account management was detected, but no further details were provided in the logs.\n\nHere's a potential timeline of events:\n\n- Winlogbeat installation and configuration attempts.\n- System processes (`sppsvc.exe`, `svchost.exe`) running in the background.\n- Notepad opened and closed once.\n- Chrome opened and performed various registry changes and a DNS query.\n- Setup.exe created a temporary file."}
