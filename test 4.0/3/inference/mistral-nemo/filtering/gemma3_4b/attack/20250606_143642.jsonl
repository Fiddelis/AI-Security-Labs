Here are some potential indicators:\n\n- The use of `whoami.exe` for privilege enumeration.\n- The cleanup of files related to 'entrada_principal.zip'.\n- The generation and subsequent deletion of a PowerShell script.\n- Interaction with Windows Defender-related components.\n\nIt's recommended to investigate further and monitor the system for any other suspicious activities or unusual behavior."}
