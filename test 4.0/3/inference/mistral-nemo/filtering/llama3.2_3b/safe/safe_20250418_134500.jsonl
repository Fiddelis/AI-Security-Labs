Here's how the events unfolded:\n\n- The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process was created, which is responsible for handling updates and installations of Microsoft Edge.\n- During its execution, this process accessed two files:\n  - First, it interacted with an executable file (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`) located in the 'Download' folder of the Edge update directory. This suggests that the update was being downloaded or prepared for installation.\n  - Secondly, it accessed a temporary file (`setup.exe` inside `EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp`) situated in the 'Install' folder. This indicates that the update process was preparing to install the new version of Microsoft Edge.\n\nIn summary, these logs show the behind-the-scenes activities when Microsoft Edge was updating on a Windows machine."}
