{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The provided data appears to represent a sequence of system events, likely captured from a security monitoring tool. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, categorized for clarity and with explanations:\n\n**1. Initial Payload Execution (HTML File)**\n\n*   **Process:** `sppsvc.exe` - This is likely related to Software Protection Service, often used for software licensing. Its presence might be normal, but warrants checking for unusual interactions.\n*   **Image Loaded:** `taskschd.dll` - The Task Scheduler DLL is loaded. This suggests that an executable is being scheduled, or it is a dependency for the process.\n*   **Process:** `svchost.exe` - This is a generic host process for Windows services. The registry event indicates something related to a service is being modified.\n*   **Process:** `powershell.exe` - This is critical. The presence of PowerShell strongly suggests malicious activity is underway.\n\n**2. Reconnaissance and File Removal (PowerShell Script)**\n\n*   **Process:** `whoami.exe` - This command is being run to determine the current user context. It's often used during reconnaissance by attackers to understand the environment.\n*   **Process:** `powershell.exe` - Another PowerShell execution, indicating continued script activity.\n*   **Process:** `powershell.exe`, `command_line`: `\"powershell.exe\" & {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}` - **This is the most concerning line.** This is a PowerShell command that attempts to delete a zip file named `entrada_principal.zip` located in the user's temporary directory (`$env:Temp`).  The `-Force` parameter bypasses confirmation prompts, ensuring the deletion happens without user interaction. The `&` signifies running the remove command in a separate process.  This suggests an attempt to erase traces of the initial payload.\n*   **Process:** `powershell.exe` - A general PowerShell process.\n*   **Image Loaded:** `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll` -  Indicates the PowerShell script is using the .NET framework, which is very common.\n\n**Summary of Analysis**\n\nThe sequence of events describes a clear attack pattern:\n\n1.  **Initial Infection:** An HTML file (likely a malicious web page or attached to an email) initiated a chain of events.\n2.  **Persistence\/Execution:**  PowerShell is being used to execute commands.\n3.  **Reconnaissance:** The `whoami` command suggests gathering information about the system.\n4.  **Data Removal\/Cleanup:** The PowerShell command to remove `entrada_principal.zip` from the temp directory is a significant indicator of an attacker trying to cover their tracks. This suggests the attacker downloaded the initial payload within `entrada_principal.zip`.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n*   **Isolate the System:** Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further propagation of the threat.\n*   **Malware Scan:** Run a full system scan with updated anti-malware software. This is essential to detect and remove any remaining malicious components.\n*   **Review Event Logs:** Examine Windows Event Logs for additional clues about the attack, including the source of the initial infection.\n*   **Investigate Network Traffic:** Analyze network traffic to identify any communication with suspicious IP addresses or domains.\n*   **File Recovery:** The deleted `entrada_principal.zip` *might* be recoverable using data recovery tools. If recovered, analyze this file in a sandboxed environment to understand its contents.\n*   **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of opening attachments from unknown senders and visiting suspicious websites.\n*   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Deploy an EDR solution to provide real-time threat detection and response capabilities.\n*   **Firewall Rules:** Create firewall rules to block suspicious IP addresses or domains identified during the investigation.\n\n**Crucially, the attacker is actively trying to remove evidence of their actions.** A thorough investigation is required to understand the full scope of the compromise and prevent future attacks."}
