CSC.EXE is used to compile code, and the command lines involve temporary files and obscure filenames (pacote_padrao.exe, registro_ativo.exe, etc.). This pattern strongly suggests potential code compilation and execution, potentially malicious. Multiple executions of CSC.EXE and subsequent execution of the created executables raise a high degree of concern.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
