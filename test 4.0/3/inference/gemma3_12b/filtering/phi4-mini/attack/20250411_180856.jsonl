While some events are benign (e.g., calc.exe, notepad), the combination suggests potential reconnaissance, lateral movement, or malicious activity. The WMIC activity warrants further investigation, as it could be used for information gathering or executing commands. The repeated network connections and registry modifications are also concerning.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
