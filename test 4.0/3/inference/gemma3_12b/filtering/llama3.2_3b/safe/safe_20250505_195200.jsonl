This is because the creation of these localized strings files is a standard, expected part of how Microsoft Office operates. It handles localization for different languages.\n*   **`event`**:  Describes the action that occurred (\"File created\").\n*   **`process`**: The process that initiated the action (SDXHelper.exe).  This is an Office component, making the creation of localized files expected.\n*   **`details`**:  Provides the specific file path of the created file. This confirms the file is part of the Office localization system.\n*   **`risk`**: Categorizes the risk level. \"Low\" indicates this is normal behavior.\n*   **`reason`**:  Explains why the risk is considered low.\n*   **`confidence`**:  Represents the certainty of the risk assessment.  A high confidence (0.95) indicates a strong belief that the assessment is correct.  Given the known behavior of Office, this is justified.\n\n**Why this is likely benign:**\n\n*   **Office Localization:** Microsoft Office needs to manage localized strings for different languages. The process `SDXHelper.exe` is often involved in creating or updating these localized resources.\n*   **Standard Operation:**  The file paths all point to standard Office localization directories.\n*   **No Suspicious Indicators:**  There's nothing immediately alarming about the file names or content types.\n\n**Important Note:**  This assessment is based on the provided information.  A more thorough investigation might be required if you have additional context or concerns about the environment."}
