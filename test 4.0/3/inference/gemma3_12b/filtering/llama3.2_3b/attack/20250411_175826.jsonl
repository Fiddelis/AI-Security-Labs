This pattern strongly suggests an attempt to conceal modifications or hide evidence, potentially indicating malicious activity. The repeated `Get-ChildItem` commands manipulating `LastWriteTime` are a key indicator.  The suspicious commands are obfuscated with path manipulations ('..') and strange file names.
