While some of this is normal browser behavior, the sheer volume and continuous nature of the registry events, combined with the image loading of taskschd.dll, raise concerns about potential malicious activity like persistent malware or configuration hijacking. Svchost and WmiPrvSE processes are also present, which can be associated with malicious behavior.
