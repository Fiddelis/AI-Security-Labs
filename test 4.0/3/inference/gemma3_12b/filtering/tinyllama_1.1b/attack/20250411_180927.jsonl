This suggests potential unauthorized user creation, a common tactic in lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.  The repeated registry modifications and image loads by chrome.exe, along with the presence of `bitsproxy.dll` loaded into svchost.exe, also warrant further investigation to rule out potential malicious browser extensions or proxy manipulations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
