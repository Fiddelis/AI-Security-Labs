{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The provided logs show a series of events related to service creation, registry modifications, image loading, and PowerShell script execution. Here's a breakdown and analysis of the key activities:\n\n**1. Initial Process Creation and Registry Modification (services.exe):**\n\n*   `services.exe`: This process likely initiated the sequence of events. It's involved in managing Windows services. A registry value modification occurred, probably setting up configurations for the subsequent actions.\n\n**2. Image Loading and Sppsvc.exe (Windows Imaging):**\n\n*   `sppsvc.exe`:  This process is related to the Windows Software Protection Preinstallation Environment (SPP). It handles licensing and activation related tasks. Loading `taskschd.dll` suggests that scheduling functionality, potentially related to the service creation process, is being utilized.\n\n**3. Service Creation and Startup (Powershell)**\n\n*   The repeated occurrences of PowerShell executing a specific script are extremely significant. This is the most concerning activity. The PowerShell script creates and starts a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\".\n    *   `New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"`: This command creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\".  Crucially, it specifies `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` as the binary path.  **This is the executable that will run when the service starts, and its contents are entirely unknown based on the log data.**  The name \"tarefa_logico.exe\" (task logic.exe) suggests a purpose, but without knowing its code, it's impossible to assess its true function.\n    *   `Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"`:  This command immediately starts the newly created service.\n\n**Key Concerns and Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**\n\n*   **Unusual Service Name:** The name \"objeto_ativo\" (active object) isn’t a typical Windows service name, increasing suspicion.\n*   **Unknown Executable:**  `tarefa_logico.exe` is the most critical area of concern. It’s a custom executable with an unknown purpose and origin.  **It is likely malicious code being hidden as a service.**\n*   **PowerShell Scripting:**  Malicious actors frequently use PowerShell to execute commands and create services, as it provides a powerful and stealthy method to achieve their goals.\n*   **Service Creation and Immediate Startup:** The rapid creation and immediate startup of the service is a typical tactic to ensure persistence and execution.\n* **Path:** The path \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\"  is non-standard and likely created as part of this operation.  This is another indicator of a compromised system.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Investigate `tarefa_logico.exe`:**  **This is the highest priority.** The file must be analyzed with antivirus, anti-malware tools, and a sandbox environment. Submit it to VirusTotal and other online analysis services.\n2.  **Examine the PowerShell Script:**  The entire script is needed to understand exactly what it's doing. Look for other hidden commands or logic.\n3.  **Analyze Registry Changes:**  Examine the registry keys modified by `services.exe` to see if they have been altered by the malicious PowerShell script.\n4.  **Scan the System:** Perform a full system scan with updated antivirus and anti-malware tools.\n5.  **Review Recent Changes:**  Investigate any other recent changes to the system, including new processes, files, or registry entries.\n6.  **Check System Integrity:** Verify the integrity of critical system files using tools like System File Checker (SFC).\n7.  **Isolate the System:** If a compromise is suspected, isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe logs strongly suggest a potential system compromise. The creation of a custom service with an unknown executable is a serious indicator of malicious activity. Immediate and thorough investigation is crucial to identify the true nature of the threat and remediate the system.  The name \"tarefa_logico.exe\" and its location should be immediately researched and isolated."}
