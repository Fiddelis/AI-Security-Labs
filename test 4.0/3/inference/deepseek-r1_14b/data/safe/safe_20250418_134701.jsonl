I'm looking at a batch of JSONL events where each line is an event with the same structure.

The paths look like they're part of a project's dependencies, specifically under cypress and lodash in a node_modules directory.

My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, each event has three main components: process info, winlog details, and file information. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\". The winlog task mentions \"File created\" with a specific rule. The file paths all seem to be under a user's Downloads folder, specifically within a course called \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\", which I assume relates to software quality or similar.\n\nHmm, so each event is about a file being created by git.exe in this particular directory. The files are TypeScript definition files (d.ts) for lodash functions. That makes sense because when you clone a repository that uses tools like npm or yarn, you often see the node_modules folder being populated with various packages and their type definitions.\n\nNow, considering if this is suspicious. Git is a version control tool commonly used in development environments. It's normal for it to interact with files in node_modules, especially during installations or updates of dependencies. The paths here look typical for such operationsâ€”nothing stands out as unusual or indicative of malicious activity.\n\nI also note that all events are from the same process and similar file creations. There's no variation in the process name or any signs of multiple processes creating files in different locations. No elevated privileges are mentioned, nor are there any failed attempts or errors that might indicate something is wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the files being created are part of Cypress types for lodash functions, which suggests this is related to a development environment where testing frameworks like Cypress are used. This aligns with normal software development activities rather than anything malicious.\n\nSo, putting it all together: these events don't raise any red flags. They seem consistent with standard development operations involving Git and npm\/yarn package installations. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, unusual file creation patterns, or indicators of malware in the logs provided.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by git.exe during development operations in a node_modules directory, which is typical for software development and not indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and decide if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSON structure, each line is an individual event. All of them have \"process\" as git.exe, which suggests that Git is being used here. The task in all cases is a file creation under Windows, so it's related to files being made on the system.\n\nThe paths are all within a user directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp. The filenames vary but they end with .d.ts, which I know is a TypeScript declaration file extension. So these are type definitions for a module called lodash in the cypress package.\n\nSince all events are from git.exe creating files, it seems like someone is working on a project where Git is tracking changes. The creation of multiple d.ts files suggests that perhaps the types are being updated or added. Node_modules is a common folder in npm-based projects, so this looks like part of a typical development environment.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no unusual process names, file accesses to sensitive areas, or anything out of place for a developer using Git and TypeScript. It's more about standard file operations during development work.\n\nSo overall, these logs are pretty normal for someone working on a software project with Node.js and Git. No red flags or indicators of compromise detected.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple files being created by git.exe in a node_modules directory as part of a software development environment, which is normal behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}

Let me go through them one by one to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, every line starts with the process name \"git.exe\". That makes sense because Git is a version control tool often used in development environments. The next part is under \"winlog\", where each task is labeled as \"File created\" and references a specific rule called \"FileCreate\". So it looks like these are file creation events being logged by the system.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to files within the \"node_modules\" directory of a project named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". Specifically, the files are TypeScript definition (.d.ts) files located in the \"cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\/\" folder. The filenames vary but they all seem to be related to Lodash utility functions like invoke, isBoolean, isEmpty, etc.\n\nSo, putting this together, it appears that Git is creating several files as part of its operation. Since these are within a node_modules directory, it's likely during the installation or update process of a project's dependencies. Node modules are where npm packages, including Lodash and Cypress, store their files after being installed via npm.\n\nI'm wondering why these events would be logged. It could be that Git is being used in an unusual way, like through a custom script or perhaps for versioning the node_modules directory itself. But node_modules directories often get large because they contain all the package files, so it's possible that during a clone or sync operation, Git creates these files.\n\nNow, considering whether this is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Typically, normal operations by tools like Git shouldn't raise flags on their own unless there are unusual patterns or access times. However, since all these events are happening under the same process and in a common development directory, it seems consistent with expected behavior. There's no indication of unauthorized access, file deletions, or other signs of malicious activity.\n\nAnother angle to consider is if any of these files were modified or accessed outside their normal patterns. But without additional context about unusual timestamps or user accounts, there's nothing here that stands out as suspicious.\n\nSo overall, while the events are legitimate and part of a standard development workflow, they don't present any immediate security concerns.

My task is to determine if these events as a whole are interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, let's look at each event individually. They all seem similar. Each one reports that a file was created by the process \"git.exe\". The file paths are all under \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\fp\\\\\" but with different filenames ending in \".d.ts\".\n\nHmm, .d.ts files are TypeScript declaration files. They're part of the TypeScript language and usually contain type definitions. So these look like they're related to the Cypress testing framework's type definitions for lodash functions.\n\nThe process name is git.exe. Git is a version control system, so maybe this user is cloning or pulling a repository that includes node_modules, which makes sense in a development environment. The files being created are part of the project's dependencies, specifically under Cypress and Lodash.\n\nSince all events are from the same process (git.exe) creating files in a predictable location with standard filenames, it doesn't seem suspicious at first glance. These look like normal file creation events during a git operation, such as pulling down or updating dependencies.\n\nI should consider if there's any unusual pattern here. The same process is creating multiple files, but that's expected when installing or updating node modules. There's no indication of file paths being outside the project directory or any signs of malicious activity like executable creation or access to sensitive areas.\n\nLooking at all 14 events together, they don't show any deviation from standard behavior. They're all about creating type definition files during a git operation, which is typical in a development setup. There's no evidence of file deletions, modifications outside the expected scope, or attempts to execute code that could indicate an attack.\n\nThe justification for classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" would be based on the normalcy of these events within a software development context. Since there are no red flags like unusual file access times, unexpected locations, or known malicious file hashes, it's safe to conclude these aren't concerning.\n\nMy confidence in this classification is quite high because I'm seeing consistent and expected behavior across all events.

That makes sense because Git is commonly used in development environments for version control. Then, there's an entry under winlog indicating that a file was created, specifically mentioning the rule \"FileCreate\". So, this seems like a standard file creation event triggered by the Git process.\n\nThe file paths all point to different .d.ts files within the node_modules directory of a Cypress project. For example, one path is \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\last.d.ts\". These are TypeScript definition files, which are typically used to provide type information for JavaScript\/TypeScript projects. Cypress is a testing framework, and lodash is a utility library, so this setup seems normal for a development environment.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple files being created by the Git process in a node_modules directory. Since node_modules is where third-party packages are stored, and Git often interacts with such directories during operations like cloning or installing dependencies, this activity looks legitimate.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. No unusual file paths, no suspicious processes, just normal file creation events related to development tools. The repetition of similar events suggests a bulk operation, which is typical when multiple files are being handled by Git as part of an update or installation process.\n\nTherefore, the batch doesn't indicate any concerning activities that would warrant further investigation.

The repeated creation of these files could be normal during a npm install or when building the project, as Node.js modules often generate or update their type definitions.\n\nI'm wondering if this is unusual behavior. Well, in development environments, especially with tools like Git and Node.js, such file operations are standard. There's no indication here of any malicious activity, like access to sensitive files, multiple failed login attempts, or unexpected processes. The fact that all events are from the same process and target typical project files makes me think this is just routine.\n\nSo considering all these points, I don't see anything out of the ordinary.

They all involve the process \"git.exe\" creating files. The file paths are consistent too; they're all under the node_modules folder of a Cypress project within a user's Downloads directory. Specifically, these files belong to the lodash library, which is commonly used in JavaScript projects.\n\nI notice that each event has the same structure: the process name is git.exe, the task is \"File created\" as per the rule FileCreate, and the file paths are different but all related to Lodash types. This repetition makes me think that this is part of a normal build or setup process where multiple files are being created or perhaps updated during a Git operation.\n\nNow, considering whether this batch is interesting for investigation: Since all events seem to be related to the creation of expected files in a development environment, there's nothing unusual here.

That tells me it's related to Git, which is a version control system used for software development. So whatever is happening here might be part of a developer's workflow or CI\/CD pipeline.\n\n2. **Windows Log Task**: The task field says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This indicates that each event is logging the creation of a file on the system. It's pretty standard to log file creations, so individually these aren't suspicious, but when there are multiple in quick succession, it might warrant closer look.\n\n3. **File Path**: The files being created are all under \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\\".

This suggests it's part of a JavaScript or TypeScript project using tools like Cypress for testing.\n- The fact that 14 different .d.ts files are being created might indicate some form of script execution, possibly during a build process or when installing dependencies. In development environments, it's common to generate these files automatically.\n\nI'm trying to think if there's anything unusual here. Since all events involve the same process and similar file operations in a typical project directory, I don't see any immediate red flags. However, sometimes attackers use legitimate processes for malicious activities, so context is important. Without knowing more about the environment (like whether this activity happened during expected times or if it's outside normal hours), it's hard to say definitively.\n\nBut given that these are standard file creation events by a known development tool (Git) in a typical project structure, I would lean towards not being particularly interesting from a security standpoint.

I know that .d.ts files are TypeScript declaration files, which are part of the npm package structure in Node.js modules. Cypress is a testing tool often used in web development, so it's common to have these files in a project.\n\nNow, considering git.exe is involved. Git is a version control system, and when you clone a repository or perform operations that download dependencies, it might create files in the node_modules directory. So, each of these events seems to be part of the process of setting up a development environment with npm packages.\n\nI should check if creating multiple files in this manner is normal during setup. From what I understand, when you run commands like `npm install`, it downloads and extracts package files into node_modules, which would involve creating several .d.ts files as part of the type definitions for TypeScript projects.\n\nSince all events are happening under a consistent process (git.exe) and within expected directories related to development tools, there's no indication of unusual or malicious activity. No signs of unexpected file creation locations, access times outside normal working hours, or attempts to execute scripts without proper context.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't seem to indicate any suspicious behavior.

There's no indication of unusual file creation locations outside common project structures, nor are there signs of executing these files or other suspicious behaviors.\n\nAnother point is the frequency and volume. While there are multiple events, they're all part of the same setup process during development.
