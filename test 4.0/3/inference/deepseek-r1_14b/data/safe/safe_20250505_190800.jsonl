{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what I have here. There are multiple JSON events that I need to analyze as a whole. I'm looking for any signs of malicious activity or anything out of the ordinary.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file at .winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal; likely part of log rotation or configuration updates. Nothing suspicious here.\n\nSecond and third events involve mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE modifying registry values. These are common system processes, so that's not concerning either.\n\nThen there's a series of events from powershell.exe starting with Process Create. Powershell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to pay attention here. The command line just shows the default path, which isn't alarming on its own.\n\nLooking at the ImageLoad events, powershell is loading several DLLs, including mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. These are standard .NET framework components; no red flags there.\n\nI notice multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events from powershell.exe. This might be normal operation as it initializes various providers or modules.\n\nThere's a FileCreate event for a .ps1 file in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1. Powershell scripts can be malicious, but script policy tests are usually part of system checks to enforce security policies. The fact that it creates and then deletes this file might indicate an attempt to bypass certain restrictions or test permissions.\n\nAdditionally, there's a Pipe Created event from powershell.exe, which could allow communication between processes. While legitimate for some scripts, it can also be used maliciously to create backdoors or communicate with other processes.\n\nOverall, the batch shows powershell activity that includes creating and deleting a script file, loading various DLLs, and opening a pipe. These actions alone might not be malicious but could indicate potential suspicious behavior, especially since they're part of a series of events from the same process over time.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes loading various DLLs and performing file operations, including creating and deleting a script file in the Temp directory.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of JSONL events to analyze. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting enough for investigation or not. Let's go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them involve the process name \"powershell.exe\" and some actions related to file creation, registry changes, and image loading. There are a couple of winlogbeat.exe processes too, but they seem benign—just creating configuration files.\n\nThe first event is winlogbeat.exe creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file. That's normal because winlogbeat is an agent that logs system events, so it needs to set up its config. The second and third events also involve winlogbeat, which doesn't raise any red flags for me.\n\nThen, I see powershell.exe creating a file called teste.ps1. PowerShell scripts can be both legitimate and malicious, so this alone isn't enough, but combined with other actions, it might be something to look into.\n\nNext, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. This is standard for PowerShell since it uses the .NET framework under the hood. However, I should keep an eye out if any of these loaded images seem suspicious or come from unexpected locations.\n\nI notice that the command line for powershell.exe includes \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass\" which is a red flag because it's often used to run scripts that would otherwise be blocked by PowerShell's default restrictions. This could indicate that the scriptteste.ps1 is trying to do something it shouldn't, like potentially execute malicious commands.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Registry value sets from powershell.exe. Modifying registry keys can have significant effects on system behavior and is a common tactic for malware to persistence or change system configurations. I should analyze which registry keys were modified here—though the exact details aren't provided, just that they were set. This could be part of creating a persistent backdoor or altering security settings.\n\nThere's also an event labeled \"Execute a Remote Command\" without any file information. That's concerning because executing remote commands can allow attackers to run arbitrary code on the system. It's possible this is part of a command-and-control communication or a way to download additional malicious payloads.\n\nAnother point is that powershell.exe creates and then deletes a file in the Temp directory (__PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1). Creating and deleting files quickly can be an attempt to avoid detection, which might indicate some form of malicious activity. This behavior is often seen in fileless malware or attempts to test if script execution policies are enforced.\n\nAdditionally, powershell.exe creates a StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file in the user's AppData directory. This could be related to profile data for non-interactive sessions, but without more context, it's hard to say. It might just be normal PowerShell operation, but coupled with other actions, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nPutting this all together: The repeated use of powershell.exe with Bypass Execution Policy, combined with creating and deleting files in Temp, modifying registry entries, and executing a remote command—these are all behaviors that could indicate malicious activity. While individual events might not be suspicious on their own, the sequence and combination suggest potential compromise.\n\nI'm concerned about the \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass\" flag because it's commonly used for malicious scripts to run without user consent. The creation of a test script in Temp and its subsequent deletion also raises flags as attackers often use such tactics to avoid detection. The remote command execution is particularly worrying, as it could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nHowever, I should consider the possibility that this could be a legitimate administrative task using PowerShell with Bypass for certain operations. But given the combination of events, especially the deletion of the script and the remote command execution, it leans more towards malicious intent.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing all these events together, I would classify this batch as INTERESTING because there are multiple red flags that collectively suggest potential unauthorized or malicious activity on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including execution with Bypass policy, file creation\/deletion in Temp, registry modifications, and remote command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
