{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed. Powershell is a common tool for administrators but can also be used maliciously. The first two events show powershell accessing processes, which in itself isn't necessarily suspicious unless it's done without proper authorization or context.\n\nNext, I notice that the same script path is created and then deleted within a short time frame. This could indicate a script that's being executed quickly to avoid detection or to perform some malicious activity before being removed. The creation of __PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1 in the Temp directory and its subsequent deletion raises a red flag because attackers often clean up their tracks.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe is importing a module from a specific path: \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The use of relative paths like \"..\" might be an attempt to hide the true location of the script, which is another concerning sign. Additionally, the command line shows an Invoke-entrada_principal function being called with parameters, which isn't a standard Powershell cmdlet and could be custom or malicious code.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are several ImageLoad tasks for various DLLs loaded by powershell.exe. This is normal when scripts run but combined with the other suspicious activities, it's worth monitoring. The FileDeleteDetected event for the script file further supports the idea that something was executed and then cleaned up.\n\nAnother point of concern is the use of svchost.exe creating a log file and modifying the registry. SvcHost is typically used by legitimate Windows services, but in some cases, it can be exploited by malware to hide processes or create backdoors. The creation of edbtmp.log might not be inherently malicious, but combined with other indicators, it could be part of an attack vector.\n\nOverall, the repeated powershell.exe activity, especially involving script execution and deletion, along with the use of custom modules and potential attempts to obfuscate file paths, points towards potentially malicious behavior. While some events on their own might not raise alarms, the combination suggests a possible security incident that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and executing scripts, including creating and deleting files quickly, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break down each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, svchost.exe, sppsvc.exe, powershell.exe, backgroundTaskHost.exe, msedgewebview2.exe. These are all common Windows processes, some of which are known to be legitimate but can sometimes be used maliciously.\n\nThe events include tasks like Registry value set, File created, and Image loaded. For example, the first few entries show 'Registry value set' tasks by RuntimeBroker.exe and HxTsr.exe. I know that registry modifications can be part of normal operations, but they're often also a sign of malicious activity since attackers might modify system settings.\n\nThere's an event where powershell.exe sets a registry value and creates a file in the StartupProfileData directory. This is concerning because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. Unusual script executions or modifications could indicate potential threats.\n\nMultiple entries from svchost.exe, which is a generic host process for services. It's known to be used by various legitimate services but can also be exploited by malware. The file paths under SoftwareDistribution\\\\Download seem suspicious as they're related to update processes, and having several .dll files being created could indicate malicious payload deployment.\n\nAdditionally, the repeated loading of urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll by different processes might be a red flag. These DLLs are typically used for network-related tasks, but their use in combination with other activities could hint at command-and-control communication or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not seem suspicious on their own, the pattern of multiple registry modifications, file creations by svchost.exe and powershell.exe, and loading of specific DLLs across different processes suggests a coordinated activity that's worth investigating. The confidence isn't extremely high since some of these actions can be part of normal updates or legitimate scripts, but the combination points towards potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creations by svchost.exe and powershell.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, all the events involve 'svchost.exe' as the process name. I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used by various services, so on its own, seeing this isn't suspicious. But looking at what it's doing can indicate malicious activity.\n\nThe logs show several instances where tasks are either setting registry values or creating files. The majority of these events (like 14 out of 20) are 'Registry value set' tasks. Registry modifications can be part of normal system operations, but they're also commonly used by malware to hide themselves or modify system configurations.\n\nLooking at the file paths associated with some events: one creates a file in 'C:\\Windows\\Logs\\waasmedic', another in 'SoftwareDistribution\\Download', and others in 'ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData'. These locations can be legitimate, but they might also be areas where malicious activities occur because they are less commonly monitored or are used for specific types of operations.\n\nI notice that some file paths end with '.etl' which I recognize as Event Trace Log files. Malware sometimes creates these to store data or logs their activity, so this could be a red flag.\n\nAlso, there's an event where the process is 'None', meaning no associated program was found for the task. This might suggest that the file creation isn't tied to any known process, which could indicate potential malicious behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—the repeated registry modifications and file creations in less common directories—it does raise some concerns. However, without additional context or more specific indicators of compromise (like known malicious file hashes or unusual network activity), it's hard to be certain. But the combination is enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creations by svchost.exe, including creation of .etl files in non-standard locations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving svchost.exe and MpSigStub.exe creating files in certain directories. Svchost is a common system process, but it can sometimes be used by malware. However, the paths here seem related to Windows updates or software distribution, which might be normal.\n\nThen there's MpSigStub.exe from Microsoft Defender. It creates several files in the Temp directory with specific names like mpasdlta.vdm and mpavdlta.vdm. These look like they could be update patches or deltas, which is standard for antivirus updates. The file paths seem legitimate, not something suspicious.\n\nThere are also events from setup.exe creating various .exe files in the Microsoft EdgeCore folder. This seems normal during software installations or updates. Microsoft Edge being updated shouldn't raise flags.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe accessing registry values might be part of Windows' regular operations, especially for services that require elevated privileges.\n\nLastly, powershell.exe being accessed is a bit concerning because it's often used by attackers. But in this case, the log only mentions process access without any command-line arguments or other suspicious activities. It might just be legitimate administrative work.\n\nPutting all together, most events are related to system updates and standard processes. The only potential red flag is powershell.exe, but there's no evidence of malicious activity here. So I would classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal system processes and updates, including Microsoft Defender activities and Windows update-related file creations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's a process named \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems normal because whoami is often used to check user information, but sometimes attackers use it too. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, multiple events show powershell.exe being accessed and then creating processes. Powershell can be legitimate or malicious. The command line in one of the events looks suspicious—it has a long string with \"New-Service\" and some paths. That might indicate an attempt to create a new service, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nAlso, there are several file operations: creating a temp script and then deleting it immediately. This is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection by removing evidence quickly. Plus, the file path has some misspellings like \"unidade_logico\" instead of \"lógica,\" which might be intentional obfuscation.\n\nThe events also show powershell.exe loading various .NET frameworks and defender components, which could be normal. But combined with the suspicious command line and quick file deletion, it raises flags.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry writes from services.exe. Services often interact with the registry, but repeated writes can indicate malicious activity like installing backdoors or altering system configurations without proper authorization.\n\nPutting all this together: powershell running scripts, creating services, deleting files, and accessing the registry—this looks like potential malicious behavior. The combination of these actions could be part of an attack chain, such as dropping a payload, establishing persistence, and then covering tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activity including creating a service, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and multiple registry writes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is \"tarefa_logico.exe\" and the Windows log task is \"Image loaded\". The files being loaded are all related to .NET framework components like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. This seems normal because these are standard system files that many applications depend on. There's no indication of any unusual activity here, so I don't think this part is concerning.\n\nNext, there are events where the process is \"powershell.exe\". The first one shows a file creation in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This could be normal if it's part of standard user profile setup. Then, there's an event where powershell.exe sets a registry value. Again, this might not be malicious on its own but worth keeping an eye on.\n\nHowever, towards the end, I notice several events where the process is \"powershell.exe\" with specific command lines. The command line includes importing a PowerShell script from \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\ComponenteAuxiliar.ps1\". This script is being executed with some try-catch blocks and parameters like OutputDirectory set to %env:Temp%. Importantly, the task in the Windows log alternates between 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which are typical for PowerShell events when modules are loaded or scripts run.\n\nWhat's a bit concerning here is that there are multiple identical command lines being executed. This repetition might indicate scripting activity, possibly automated or part of a scheduled task. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious. The script path is specific, but I don't have information about what this script does. If it were known malware, that would be a red flag, but as it stands, it could be a legitimate system script.\n\nAdditionally, the last few events show \"None\" for process and file, which might be noise or incomplete log entries, not necessarily significant on their own.\n\nConsidering all these points together, while there are some activities involving PowerShell and loading of specific scripts, there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The repeated script execution could be either benign or potentially suspicious, but without more data, it's hard to classify it as definitely malicious. Therefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities don't clearly indicate a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate system processes and PowerShell script execution without clear indicators of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're worth investigating. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that most events involve PowerShell executing scripts. The command lines show `powershell.exe` being used with some PS1 files. Specifically, there are multiple calls to create a service named \"objeto_ativo\" using `New-Service`, which seems repetitive but might be part of legitimate system operations or could indicate a script running multiple times.\n\nThen, I see events where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command', pointing to a specific PowerShell script path. This suggests remote execution, which can be a red flag because attackers often use remote commands to execute malicious scripts on systems they've compromised.\n\nI also notice that some of these events have `process` details and others don't. The ones without process info but with file access for the PS1 files might indicate an attempt to run those scripts directly or via another method.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple attempts to create a service using PowerShell, plus remote command executions pointing to the same script. This pattern could be part of a larger attack campaign where attackers are setting up persistent mechanisms (services) and executing malicious code remotely. The repetition might suggest a loop or automated process trying to establish persistence across reboots.\n\nGiven these points, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because it shows potential signs of malicious activity like remote execution and service creation, which are common in APTs or malware campaigns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated attempts to create a service via PowerShell and execute remote commands pointing to the same script.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Most of them are similar—multiple entries where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path points to the same PowerShell script. There's also some variation with services.exe logon and special logon events.\n\nFirst, the repeated remote command execution on the same script might indicate suspicious activity, possibly scripting or automation. The script's path seems unusual, maybe related to logical units or secondary records—could be a red flag if it's unexpected in the environment.\n\nHowever, there are only two other types of events, which don't seem directly related to malicious behavior. Maybe these are legitimate system activities alongside some potentially concerning ones.\n\nI need to balance: is the frequency and repetition enough to raise an eyebrow? It seems like it could be either repeated normal activity or something more nefarious. Without more context, like user details or other event correlations, it's hard to say definitively. But the volume of remote command executions stands out.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated execution of a PowerShell script from an unusual path and special logon activities, which may indicate potential malicious behavior or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system events is interesting or not. Let's look at what each event has.\n\nEach line starts with a JSON object. The first key is \"process\" which is set to \"None\". Then there's \"winlog\", which is another JSON object inside it. The task field in winlog varies between different things like \"Execute a Remote Command\" and \"Windows Update Agent\". There's also the \"file\" key, which sometimes has a path pointing to some .ps1 script file on the system.\n\nLooking at the batch, I see multiple events where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\", all referencing the same file path. Then there are a couple of events with tasks related to \"Windows Update Agent\" and one where the process is None and both winlog and file are null.\n\nI know that \"Execute a Remote Command\" sounds suspicious because it could indicate remote code execution, which might be part of an attack. The repeated use of the same script file makes me think this activity is intentional or automated. However, the inclusion of Windows Update Agent tasks suggests normal system updates or maintenance, which are usually benign.\n\nBut since so many events are about executing a remote command on the same file, it's possible that this could be malicious activity, like a script being executed multiple times in quick succession. On the other hand, if this is part of legitimate automated processes or scripts run by admins, it might not be suspicious.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events have \"None\" for process and winlog tasks, which might just be noise from the system logging too much. The fact that all these events are in a single batch makes me think they could be related, possibly an attack trying to gather information or execute malicious code across multiple attempts.\n\nGiven that there's a mix of potentially normal Windows activities (like Update Agent) and repeated execution commands, I'm leaning towards this being interesting but not certain. The confidence isn't super high because some parts might just be regular system behavior. But the repetitive remote command executions on the same file are concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated execution of a script, which may indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
