{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm supposed to determine if the given batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that many of them are related to PowerShell.exe. That's already a red flag because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate scripting and for malicious activities. So, it's something to pay attention to.\n\nLooking closer, several entries mention tasks like 'Image loaded' and 'Process accessed'. These types of events are common when an application starts up or interacts with other processes and files. However, the specific modules being loaded, such as clrjit.dll and mscoree.dll, seem normal for a PowerShell process since they're part of the .NET framework.\n\nThere's also a command line in one of the events where PowerShell is run with an Execution Policy set to Restricted. That might be a bit suspicious because sometimes attackers use restricted execution policies to avoid detection, but it could also be legitimate if it's part of a controlled environment or script.\n\nAnother point is the creation of files in specific directories like C:\\Windows\\Temp and references to systemprofile\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell. These are standard locations for PowerShell profile data, so file creation here isn't inherently malicious but could indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe event where whoami.exe is executed from system32 might be an attempt to gather information about the user or system, which can be part of reconnaissance activities. However, it's also a common command to test permissions or check the current user context, so it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nI'm noticing a lot of repetitive events related to PowerShell loading various DLLs and creating files. This could indicate normal operation, but repeated attempts or unusual paths might suggest something more nefarious. However, without seeing more context like timestamps or frequency of these events, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nIn summary, while there are elements that raise eyebrows, such as the use of PowerShell with a restricted execution policy and the creation of certain files, they don't all add up to clear malicious activity on their own. However, the combination does present some level of concern that warrants closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe loading various modules and creating files, along with a restricted execution policy and use of whoami.exe, indicate potential malicious activity or at least unusual behavior requiring further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and my task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The classification should be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING,\" along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first event shows that `cmd.exe` was executed with the command line pointing to Dism.exe with several parameters: disabling a feature named Windows-Defender and removing it without restarting. The task is \"Process Create,\" which indicates a new process creation.\n\nThe second event is PowerShell.exe being accessed, but there's no file information attached. I'm not sure what action was taken here since the command line isn't provided, but access to PowerShell could be normal or potentially malicious depending on context.\n\nNext, multiple events involve `Dism.exe` creating files in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder. Each event has different tasks like \"File Executable Detected,\" \"File Created,\" and specific paths to DLL and EXE files. The repeated creation of these files by Dism.exe is notable because Dism usually deals with system images and features, not creating files in temp directories.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all seem to be temporary files created under a unique folder name within AppData. This could indicate that some application or script is extracting or generating files there. The fact that multiple files are being created by Dism.exe might be suspicious because normally, Dism operates on system-wide components rather than user-specific temp directories.\n\nI'm also noticing the command line in the first event uses parameters to disable Windows Defender and remove it without restarting. Disabling antivirus is a common tactic for malware to avoid detection, so this could be red flag number one.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch starts with enabling Dism.exe via cmd to disable Windows Defender, then creates several files in a temp directory. While some of these actions might seem routine on their own (like using Dism), the combination—especially disabling security features and generating multiple temporary files—could indicate malicious activity such as installing malware or backdoors.\n\nThe confidence here is high because the disabling of Defender and subsequent file creation patterns are both concerning. These behaviors don't align with typical user activities and could be part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"justification\": \"The logs show the execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters to disable and remove Windows Defender, followed by multiple file creation events in a temporary directory by `Dism.exe`.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of 14 events here. Each event has similar data: the process is Dism.exe, the task is File Executable Detected, and the file path points to various .mui files in a temporary directory.\n\nFirst off, I recognize that Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing the operating system, like enabling or disabling features. So seeing it execute files isn't inherently suspicious on its own. The fact that multiple .mui files are being accessed might raise an eyebrow because those are usually language-pack resources, not something malware typically targets.\n\nBut wait, all these events are almost identical except for the specific file names. That repetition makes me think this is part of a normal process. Dism.exe would interact with several provider DLLs when performing servicing tasks. The temporary directory path also suggests it's dealing with some installation or update process that doesn't involve user interaction.\n\nI should consider the context. If this activity is happening during an official Windows Update or a legitimate software installation, it's perfectly normal. There's no indication here of any malicious intent, like multiple failed attempts, unusual file paths, or signs of persistence.\n\nSo while each event individually might seem interesting because of the executable detection, collectively they don't add up to anything suspicious. They fit the pattern of standard system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file access by Dism.exe during servicing tasks, with no signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nEach line is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always 'Dism.exe'. Dism.exe stands for Deployment Image Service Installer, which I know is a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing Windows images, like creating or updating installation files.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, each one says \"File Executable Detected\" with the same rule: FileExecutableDetected. This event usually triggers when an executable file is detected on the system, which could be part of normal operations or something malicious.\n\nThe file paths are all under a temporary folder in the user's AppData directory. The specific files being accessed have names like SysprepProvider.dll.mui, TransmogProvider.dll.mui, and so on. These seem to be DLLs with .mui extensions, which I think stands for Multilingual User Interface. That suggests they're language packs or related to localization.\n\nI notice that the same process (Dism.exe) is accessing multiple such files in sequence. Dism often works with various system files during deployment or servicing operations. Accessing these DLLs could be part of its normal functioning when dealing with different providers, like Sysprep or imaging.\n\nSince all events are generated by the same process and involve known legitimate files accessed through standard Windows processes, there's no indication of malicious activity here. The repeated detection doesn't raise red flags because Dism.exe is a well-known tool, and accessing these DLLs is part of its normal operation.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior such as access to restricted areas, multiple failed attempts, or inconsistencies with user activities. All the file paths are within expected temporary directories used by Windows during servicing tasks.\n\nTherefore, while each individual event might look suspicious on its own, the pattern here is consistent with normal system operations. There's no evidence of unauthorized access or malicious intent in these logs.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events are not indicative of malicious activity and represent legitimate operations performed by the Dism.exe process as part of its standard functionality.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process**: The process name is 'Dism.exe', a known legitimate Windows tool used for servicing OS images.\n\n2. **Event Type**: Each event triggers \"File Executable Detected,\" which can be normal or malicious depending on context.\n\n3. **File Access**: Files accessed are DLLs with .mui extensions, related to localization and part of standard system operations.\n\n4. **Path Analysis**: The files are located in a temporary directory under the user's AppData, typical for deployment tasks.\n\n5. **Pattern Recognition**: Multiple accesses by Dism.exe suggest it's performing its intended function, such as servicing or updates.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: No signs of malicious intent; events align with normal system behavior.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of log events is not considered interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. They represent legitimate operations performed by the Deployment Image Service Installer (Dism.exe) accessing necessary files for servicing Windows. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"interesting\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Events are normal system operations involving Dism.exe accessing required files.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of events. So, the user provided a series of JSONL entries where each line represents an event. The common thread here is that all events are related to file deletions logged by Dism.exe.\n\nFirst, I notice that all events involve files located in the same temporary directory path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\. The files being deleted are various DLL and MUI (Multilingual User Interface) files. Dism.exe is known to be a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing the operating system, such as enabling or disabling features.\n\nLooking at the events, one stands out because it's about changing the file creation time of a file called DismHost.exe. The rest are all File Delete logged events. This combination makes me think that an application is modifying its own files or perhaps trying to remove evidence after some activity.\n\nSince Dism.exe is a legitimate process, these deletions could be part of normal servicing operations. However, the concentration of deletions from the same temp directory and the change in file creation time are red flags. Malware often deletes files to erase traces of its activities, so this behavior might indicate suspicious or malicious activity.\n\nI need to determine if this is within normal operation parameters. Legitimate software sometimes deletes temporary files, but doing so repeatedly and changing timestamps could be an attempt to avoid detection. Given the number of different files being deleted from a temp directory created by Dism.exe, it's unusual unless something went wrong during servicing.\n\nIn summary, while Dism.exe itself is trustworthy, the specific file deletions and timestamp changes in this batch suggest potential malicious activity or at least something out of the ordinary that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletion events from a single process (Dism.exe) targeting various DLL and MUI files within the same temporary directory, which may indicate suspicious or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events. Each event is in JSONL format, and there are 14 entries here. Let me go through each one to see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events have similar structures. The process name is always \"Dism.exe\". That makes sense because Dism is related to disk management and system image deployment. The winlog field consistently shows a file deletion event with the task named \"File Delete logged\" under the rule \"FileDeleteDetected\". This indicates that a file was deleted, and it's being logged by some monitoring rule.\n\nLooking at the files being deleted, they all have paths starting with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp followed by a long GUID-like identifier. The files are DLLs, specifically .mui files which are usually language resource files for Windows components. The names vary but include terms like ImagingProvider, IntlProvider, LogProvider, etc., up to WimProvider and FfuProvider.\n\nSo the pattern here is that Dism.exe is deleting a series of temporary or cached files from a temp directory under the user's profile. These files seem to be part of Windows system components, possibly related to updates, servicing, or imaging operations. Since these are .mui files, they might be localized resources for various system services.\n\nNow, I need to determine if this batch is interesting in terms of cybersecurity. Each event by itself doesn't look suspicious because Dism.exe performing file deletions in a temp directory is normal during cleanup processes, especially after installing updates or performing deployment tasks. The use of \"FileDeleteDetected\" might trigger alerts, but in this context, it's expected behavior.\n\nThe user account involved is \"fiddelis\", which I assume is a standard user profile on the system. There's no indication here that an external actor is involved; instead, it looks like legitimate system processes are at work.\n\nI don't see any anomalies such as deletions outside of known temp directories, attempts to delete critical system files, or multiple failed deletion attempts that might indicate errors or malicious activity. All the file paths are consistent with what Dism.exe would handle during its operations.\n\nTherefore, while each event is logged and might be flagged by some monitoring tools, collectively they don't raise red flags in a cybersecurity context. They're part of normal system maintenance and cleanup processes.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events represents legitimate activity by the `dism.exe` process, which is deleting temporary files related to system components during cleanup operations. These actions are typical during updates or deployments and do not indicate suspicious behavior.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Process Identification**: The process running in each event is `Dism.exe`, associated with disk management and system imaging tasks.\n   \n2. **Event Type**: Each event logs a file deletion under the task \"File Delete logged\" triggered by \"FileDeleteDetected\", indicating a monitored file removal.\n\n3. **File Analysis**: The deleted files are DLLs located in a temp directory, likely related to Windows updates or servicing components, with names like `ImagingProvider.dll` and `WimProvider.dll`.\n\n4. **User Context**: The user profile involved is standard (`fiddelis`), not indicative of unauthorized access.\n\n5. **Contextual Normalcy**: Such deletions are expected during system operations, making them non-suspicious in a cybersecurity context.\n\n**Conclusion:** These events represent normal system behavior and do not pose a security risk."}

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this log data and trying to understand what's going on. There are multiple entries here, each with a process name, some Windows log task information, and sometimes a file path.\n\nFirst, I see services.exe doing something with the registry. That seems normal because system services often interact with the registry. Then, sppsvc.exe loading taskschd.dll also looks routine since it's part of scheduling tasks.\n\nNow, when I get to powershell.exe entries, that catches my attention. Powershell is a powerful tool and can be used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities. The first time it's created without any command line details doesn't immediately alarm me, but the next entry shows it accessing something, which could mean it's running scripts.\n\nLooking further, there's a process creation where powershell.exe runs a command to delete a specific zip file in the Temp directory using Remove-Item. This is interesting because deleting files can be part of cleaning up after malicious activities. The fact that it's forcing the deletion suggests it might not care if the file is read-only or protected.\n\nThen, there are several Image Load entries for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, which makes sense as PowerShell uses these to function. However, one of them loads MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which I'm not too familiar with. Maybe it's related to some antivirus functionality?\n\nFinally, the logs show that a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1 was created and then immediately deleted. This is concerning because creating and deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection. The fact that it's in the Temp directory and uses .ps1 extension indicates it's a PowerShell script, which aligns with the powershell.exe activity.\n\nPutting this together, while some of these actions are normal, others like the forced deletion of a file and the quick creation\/deletion of a script file might be red flags. This could indicate that someone is trying to execute scripts on the system, possibly with malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log data provided shows several activities performed by various processes on a system, along with associated Windows event logs. Here's an analysis of these logs:\n\n### 1. **Process: services.exe**\n   - **Action**: Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\n   - **Analysis**: This is a common activity for background processes that interact with the system configuration.\n\n### 2. **Process: sppsvc.exe**\n   - **Action**: Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\n   - **File Path**: C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskschd.dll\n   - **Analysis**: The `sppsvc.exe` process loading `taskschd.dll` is normal, as this DLL is part of the Windows Task Scheduler.\n\n### 3. **Process: svchost.exe**\n   - **Action**: Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\n   - **Analysis**: Similar to other system processes, this activity is expected when interacting with system services or configurations.\n\n### 4. **Process: powershell.exe**\n   - **Actions**:\n     - Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\n     - Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad) for various DLLs\n     - File created and deleted (__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1 in the Temp directory)\n     - Command line: `& {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}`\n   - **Analysis**: The PowerShell activity suggests that a script was executed to delete files from the Temp directory. This could be legitimate administrative activity or potentially malicious, depending on the context.\n\n### 5. **Process: whoami.exe**\n   - **Action**: Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\n   - **Command Line**: `\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\"`\n   - **Analysis**: The `whoami.exe` process is typically used to determine user information and is often part of legitimate system operations or scripts.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **File Deletion Activity**: The deletion of files in the Temp directory using PowerShell could indicate an attempt to remove evidence of prior activities.\n- **Script Execution**: The creation and subsequent deletion of a script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1) suggests that a PowerShell script was executed, possibly for testing or malicious purposes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile some of these activities are normal and expected on a system, the combination of PowerShell script execution and file deletions in the Temp directory could be indicative of potentially malicious behavior. Further investigation would be required to determine if these actions are authorized or part of an attack."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. So, first thing I notice is that almost all the events involve PowerShell.exe. That's a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities.\n\nLooking closer, there are several events where PowerShell is loading different DLL files. For instance, it's accessing clrjit.dll and MpClient.dll. Those might be normal system files, but I wonder if they're being used in an unusual way here. Also, there are file creation events in the user's profile directory, which could indicate that something is writing or creating new files where it shouldn't.\n\nThe logs show registry value sets too. That makes me think about persistence mechanisms—malware often uses the Windows Registry to ensure it runs on every boot. So if PowerShell is modifying the registry, that could be a sign of malicious activity trying to maintain access.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with similar command lines executing Write-Host commands and checking INF files. The fact that they're iterating over *.inf files in the Windows directory and looking for specific patterns might be an attempt to check for certain drivers or components. This behavior is unusual because it's diving deep into system files, which isn't typical for everyday scripts.\n\nThe command lines also show ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. While this is a security measure, it doesn't necessarily prevent all malicious actions since attackers can bypass restricted policies using other techniques. So the combination of restricted execution with these file and registry accesses raises suspicion.\n\nAnother point is that there are multiple identical events towards the end, which might indicate a loop or repeated attempts at certain operations. This repetition could be part of a script trying to establish persistence or spread across the system.\n\nConsidering all these points together—using PowerShell, accessing sensitive files and registry keys, unusual file creation, and repetitive commands—it seems like this batch is indeed concerning.

First off, the command lines are either running scripts to check INF files or deleting specific ZIP files in the Temp directory.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they're using a restricted execution policy which is standard for some environments but might be worth noting because it limits script functionality, though in this case, it's used within a command. The script retrieves INF files and checks if certain patterns exist—this seems like it could be related to detecting installed drivers or system components, possibly for legitimate system monitoring.\n\nThen there are events where PowerShell is deleting files from the Temp directory with specific names. The fact that they're using wildcards suggests they might be trying to remove multiple files of a particular type. However, this behavior can be tricky because it's not inherently malicious but could indicate an attempt to clean up evidence or remove unwanted files.\n\nThe repetition of these commands stands out. Several events show the same command lines being executed multiple times, sometimes across different tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. This repetition might be part of a scheduled task or automated process, which isn't unusual. However, without context on what these tasks are supposed to do normally, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI'm also noticing that all the events come from PowerShell, which is a common tool for both admins and attackers. The combination of checking system files and deleting temporary files could be part of legitimate maintenance but might also hint at malicious activity trying to remain undetected by cleaning up traces.\n\nThe justification for classification as INTERESTING comes from the fact that while each event individually might not raise red flags, the pattern of repeated actions across different log tasks could indicate something more concerning.
