{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event is about.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe indicating network connections. That seems normal because Chrome often connects to the internet. But then there are several powershell.exe instances with different tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. PowerShell can be used for legitimate things but is also common in attacks, so that's a red flag.\n\nI notice cmd.exe being used with some complex command lines involving csc.exe, which compiles C# code into executables. This seems suspicious because creating new executables on the fly could be part of malicious activity like generating malware or ransomware. The creation of files like pacote_padrao.exe and others in temporary directories is concerning.\n\nLooking at the file events, there are creations and executions of various .exe files, some named things like unidade_logico.exe and modulo_secundario.exe. These names don't ring any bells as legitimate processes, especially when combined with how they were created using csc.exe and cmd scripts.\n\nAlso, multiple RegistryEvent tasks indicate changes to the system's registry, which can be a sign of persistent malware trying to maintain access or configuration. The fact that several different processes are modifying the registry is another point against this being normal activity.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated use of powershell.exe, creation of numerous executables via cmd and csc.exe, file creations in temporary directories, and registry modifications. These behaviors are common indicators of malicious activities such as script execution, payload generation, and persistence mechanisms. The combination suggests a possible attack or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell accessing processes and registry modifications, along with executable file creations through cmd and csc.exe. These activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an event where 'tarefa_base.exe' loaded a DLL from the .NET Framework directory. That seems normal because system processes often load these libraries.\n\nNext, 'elemento_ativo.exe' was terminated. Process termination is common and doesn't immediately raise flags unless it's unexpected, but without more context, it might not be an issue.\n\nThen, several entries show 'cmd.exe', 'conhost.exe', 'notepad.exe', and others modifying the registry. These are legitimate system tools performing standard operations, so this activity isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nThere are multiple instances of 'svchost.exe' accessing the registry. Since svchost is a common Windows process for services, these events could be normal unless there's unusual behavior.\n\nI also notice that 'winlogbeat.exe' created a file in the user's downloads folder. That seems concerning because winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping and shouldn't be creating files in user directories without cause. This might indicate tampering or unauthorized access.\n\nAdditionally, multiple entries from 'powershell.exe' accessing processes and registry keys could be red flags if they're running scripts that shouldn't have such permissions, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe repeated registry modifications by 'chrome.exe' are unusual but not necessarily malicious. Chrome sometimes writes to the registry for updates or settings changes, but too many events might warrant investigation.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some anomalies like winlogbeat creating a file and powershell activity, without clear indicators of compromise, I'm leaning towards this batch being mostly normal system noise. However, the winlogbeat event stands out as potentially suspicious. My confidence is around 0.7 because while some events raise flags, others don't confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by non-standard processes and unexpected file creation by winlogbeat.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event has the process name as chrome.exe and a task indicating an image was loaded. The file path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll. I know that Windows Defender uses various DLLs, so this seems normal unless there's something unusual about the version or location.\n\nThe second event is also from chrome.exe but shows a registry value being set. This is common for applications to configure settings, so nothing suspicious here on first glance.\n\nThe third event comes from winlogbeat.exe, which I recognize as an ELK stack component used for log management. The task is file created, pointing to a .yml.new file in the user's downloads directory. Since this is related to log processing, it's likely benign unless there are signs of tampering or unexpected locations.\n\nLooking at all events together, none seem to indicate malicious activity. They're typical of normal system operationsâ€”loading necessary DLLs, setting registry values for configuration, and creating log files. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other red flags. Therefore, I would classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system operations including Chrome loading DLLs and registry settings, as well as a file creation by winlogbeat.exe for log management.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
