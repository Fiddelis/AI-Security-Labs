{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first line is chrome.exe making a DNS query. That's normal for a browser; it needs to resolve websites. Not suspicious.\n\nNext is powershell.exe doing a registry value set. PowerShell can be malicious, but this might just be legitimate admin work. I'll keep an eye on how many times it appears.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe running systeminfo and reg query. Systeminfo is standard for gathering system info, and the reg query looks into disk services. Could be part of a script or manual checking, not sure yet.\n\nAnother powershell.exe accessing process—maybe monitoring or something else. Not enough context yet.\n\ncmd.exe again setting registry values. Maybe part of a configuration script.\n\nsysteminfo.exe being created and loading modules like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so that's okay.\n\nNotepad.exe writing to the registry—that's odd because notepad isn't known for registry access. Could be suspicious or maybe a misconfiguration?\n\nsvchost.exe making file creations in winevt logs—those are Windows Event Log files. Maybe it's generating logs as part of normal operation, but I'm not sure why svchost would create files there.\n\nThen WmiPrvSE.exe starting with parameters and loading wmiutils.dll—normal for WMI services, so probably okay.\n\ncmd.exe again accessing the registry, reg.exe querying HKLM. This is getting repetitive; maybe it's a script running multiple commands.\n\nconhost.exe touching the registry too—it’s usually related to command prompts, but seeing it interact with the registry could be a red flag.\n\nservices.exe logon—that might just be service-related events.\n\nSpecial Logon from process None—could be a system account or something else.\n\nPutting this all together, there are several instances of legitimate processes accessing the registry and file creation. However, some actions like notepad.exe modifying the registry, multiple powershell.exe instances accessing processes, and svchost creating files might indicate potential malicious activity. The repeated cmd.exe and reg.exe commands could be part of a script attempting to gather information or make changes systematically.\n\nI'm leaning towards 'INTERESTING' because while many events are normal, there are enough anomalies that together could suggest an attack. My confidence is about 0.7 because it's possible these are legitimate scripts, but the combination does raise some red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes including powershell.exe and cmd.exe performing registry modifications and file operations potentially indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. So, I'm going to analyze each event and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object containing process info, winlog events, and file details. Let's start by listing out all the events:\n\n1. **winlogbeat.exe**: File created at a specific path.\n2. **ApplicationFrameHost.exe**: Registry value set.\n3. **powershell.exe**: Registry value set.\n4. Another instance of **powershell.exe** accessing a process, but no file info.\n5. **chrome.exe**: Pipe Created event.\n6. More instances of **chrome.exe** setting registry values repeatedly (total 12 times).\n7. **Calculator.exe**: Setting a registry value.\n8. Several more **chrome.exe** events with Image loaded tasks for legitimate system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are known to be part of Windows Defender.\n9. Another **winlogbeat.exe** creating the same file again.\n10. **powershell.exe** creating a new file named 'objeto_padrao.txt' in the Downloads folder.\n\nNow, I need to assess if these events collectively indicate something suspicious or not. Let's break down each part:\n\n- The initial winlogbeat.exe event is likely from the log management tool itself, so it's normal and not concerning.\n  \n- ApplicationFrameHost.exe is a legitimate Windows process related to application containers, so setting registry values here isn't unusual.\n\n- Powershell.exe being used with RegistryEvent tasks: Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate administration and malicious activities. The first event (Registry value set) alone isn't suspicious, but the later FileCreate event writing to 'objeto_padrao.txt' could be a red flag if the process doesn't have a clear purpose.\n\n- Chrome.exe's Pipe Created and ImageLoad events are normal since Chrome often interacts with system components. However, the multiple RegistryEvent entries might warrant attention because frequent registry modifications can be a sign of malicious activity or persistence mechanisms.\n\n- The Calculator.exe setting a registry value is unusual. While it's possible for legitimate applications to interact with the registry, this event could indicate tampering if there's no clear reason for Calculator to modify system settings.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch has a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. Notably, the powershell.exe creating a file in Downloads and chrome.exe making multiple registry changes stand out. These actions might be indicative of lateral movement or persistence techniques used by attackers.\n\nHowever, without more context (like timestamps showing if these events are spread over time or occurring simultaneously), it's hard to definitively classify them as malicious. The presence of legitimate processes like winlogbeat and chrome makes the batch not overly suspicious on its own, but certain behaviors do raise flags.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards classifying the batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are several red flags (powershell file creation, multiple registry writes by chrome), even though some events are normal. The confidence isn't super high since it's possible these could be legitimate activities, but the combination is enough to warrant closer inspection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious activities such as multiple registry modifications by Chrome.exe and a file creation by PowerShell.exe. These may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this log is interesting or not. The event given has process name as chrome.exe and a Windows log indicating that there was a task related to setting a registry value. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's normal for Chrome. It's common for applications like Chrome to make changes to the registry when updating settings, preferences, or extensions. These are usually legitimate activities part of their operation.\n\nI should consider if there are any red flags here. The event mentions 'RegistryEvent' and it's from Chrome.exe. Malware often manipulates the registry too, but in this case, without more context like multiple similar events, unusual locations being modified, or time patterns, I can't assume it's malicious.\n\nSince only a single event is provided and there's no evidence of anything suspicious beyond what Chrome typically does, it doesn't raise any red flags. Therefore, it's probably not something that needs immediate investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The event shows a legitimate activity where Chrome.exe sets a registry value, which is a common operation for software configuration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
