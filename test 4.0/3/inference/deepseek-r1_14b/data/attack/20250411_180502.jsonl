{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see several entries from chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. That's pretty normal because Chrome makes a lot of network calls when browsing the internet. Nothing suspicious here on its own.\n\nThen there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. The first thing that catches my attention is the command line in some of these processes. For example, one event shows \"powershell.exe & {Start-Process...}\". This seems like Powershell is being used to execute another process by running a batch file located at specific paths. The paths mentioned are C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\unidade_comum\\.. and others. These paths seem a bit generic but I'm not sure if they're malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events for mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard .NET framework components loaded by PowerShell when it runs scripts. So these alone aren't concerning unless there's something else indicating malicious activity.\n\nThere's a FileCreate event followed immediately by a FileDeleteDetected event for the same file: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_wdxgqpwc.143.ps1. This might be part of PowerShell's scripting policy testing, where it creates a temporary script to check permissions. However, if this file was malicious, we might expect more events after creation, like execution attempts, which aren't present here.\n\nAdditionally, there are PipeCreated events and Provider Lifecycle tasks, which could relate to communication between processes or system services initializing. Without more context, these don't seem alarming.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows normal user activity: browsing with Chrome and using PowerShell for script execution as part of testing or legitimate scripts. There's no evidence of unusual behavior like repeated failed attempts, access to restricted files, or known malicious process trees. The file creation and deletion could be benign, possibly related to scripting policies.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal user activity with Chrome browsing and PowerShell executing scripts as part of policy testing.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of logs to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst off, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe being executed with command lines that start other processes. For example, the first event has powershell.exe starting a process for a .bat file. I know that PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be a vector for attacks because it allows for execution of malicious scripts.\n\nLooking at the tasks in these events: there are several 'Registry value set' and 'Process Create' tasks. Registry modifications can indicate potential persistence mechanisms or changes to system configurations, which could be signs of malicious activity. Similarly, creating processes might be part of a chain where an attacker is running multiple commands or scripts.\n\nI also notice that some entries have files associated, like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll being loaded by powershell.exe. These are legitimate Windows components, but seeing them loaded in the context of other suspicious activities could raise flags. Additionally, there's a file creation event for a PowerShell profile in the user's AppData folder. This might be an attempt to create persistence or modify startup scripts.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of 'chrome.exe' with multiple registry writes. While Chrome can write to the registry normally, so many events could indicate something unusual, maybe browser hijacking or malicious extensions.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe process creating another script, which aligns with how attackers might chain commands using batch files. The fact that it's being executed via cmd could be part of an attack chain.\n\nI'm noticing several 'Process Create' and 'RegistryEvent' tasks across different processes, which suggests a lot of activity in areas where attackers often operate. The combination of multiple process creations, registry modifications, and file operations, especially when involving powershell.exe and batch files, is concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, the activities seem to indicate potential malicious behavior such as script execution, persistence mechanisms, and possibly lateral movement or payload deployment. These events don't necessarily confirm an attack, but they do raise enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes executing scripts, registry modifications, and file operations suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple processes are making changes to the registry. There are several entries where 'cmd.exe', 'conhost.exe', and 'chrome.exe' all have tasks related to setting registry values. Registry modifications can be normal, but frequent writes might indicate something malicious, like installing persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations.\n\nThen, looking at 'chrome.exe', there are instances where it's loading different DLLs. One of them is 'amsi.dll', which is part of Windows' anti-malware scanning. Malicious processes sometimes load this to try and bypass detection. The other is 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender, which makes me think maybe something is trying to interfere with antivirus operations.\n\nNext, there's an event from 'svchost.exe' creating a file in the NetworkService profile directory. That's unusual because svchost should be running under system privileges, but writing to a user profile might indicate some kind of persistence or data theft activity.\n\nThen, I see two powershell.exe processes creating files in the user's Downloads folder. Powershell is often used by attackers for scripting and can execute commands that are hard to detect. The filenames 'componente_principal.txt' and 'elemento_base.txt' don't ring any bells as standard files, so this could be suspicious.\n\nAlso, 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a configuration file in its own directory isn't too concerning on its own, but it's another data point that something is writing to the filesystem in an area not typically accessed by regular users.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple processes modifying the registry (which is a common tactic for malware to ensure persistence), powershell being used to create files, and svchost accessing user directories. These are red flags because they indicate possible unauthorized system changes, potential persistence mechanisms, and signs of data exfiltration or malicious script execution.\n\nI'm not sure if these activities are part of legitimate processes or actual malicious behavior, but the combination is concerning enough that an investigation would be warranted to rule out any threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by different processes may indicate malicious activity. Powershell and chrome.exe creating files in user directories could be suspicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
