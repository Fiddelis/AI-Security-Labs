{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs to determine if it's interesting or not. So, the first thing I notice is that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously.\n\nLooking at the process details, one event shows powershell.exe downloading something from GitHub using the iex command. That stands out because downloading scripts directly like that is often a red flag—it could indicate malware or unauthorized access.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe accesses files and registry values. Also, creating temporary files and deleting them shortly after might be an attempt to clean up traces of malicious activity. The file paths mentioned, especially the one in C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Temp, suggest some scripting is happening there, possibly trying to execute commands or payloads.\n\nAdditionally, multiple ImageLoad events for different DLLs could mean that powershell.exe is loading various components, which might be part of legitimate operations but can also help in hiding malicious activities. The fact that it's accessing Defender platform files like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll makes me wonder if the attacker is trying to bypass or manipulate antivirus measures.\n\nThe last event involves sppsvc.exe, which I know is related to Windows Server Update Services. If this process is loading taskschd.dll, maybe there's something related to task scheduling being exploited, though it's not directly linked to powershell in this case.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell with suspicious commands and file operations, especially downloading scripts from an external source and creating\/deleting temporary files, indicates potential malicious behavior. The confidence here is high because these activities are common indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing suspicious commands, including downloading a script from an external source and creating\/deleting temporary files, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, there's a process named svchost.exe that modified a registry value. That's normal since many services use svchost. Next, sppsvc.exe created a file in the cache directory—standard Windows behavior.\n\nThen, whoami.exe was run from the command line. This is often used to check user privileges and might be harmless unless it's part of a larger sequence. \n\nNow, looking at powershell.exe entries: there are multiple instances where PowerShell accessed processes, loaded images, created files, and set registry values. One thing that stands out is a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1 being created and then deleted shortly after. This script execution could be testing the environment for vulnerabilities or trying to bypass policies.\n\nAlso, there's a command line parameter in one of the PowerShell events: \"& {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\". This creates a new drive mapped to \"\\\\Target\\C$\", which suggests attempting to access another system. If \"Target\" is a network share or another machine, this could indicate lateral movement in a network.\n\nConsidering all together: multiple PowerShell activities with suspicious script execution and potential external system access. These actions don't align with normal user behavior and could be signs of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes, loading images, creating files, and setting registry values. Notably, a suspicious script file was created and deleted, and there's evidence of potential lateral movement via PowerShell commands.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first thing that stands out is the repeated use of PowerShell commands. Specifically, most of the events show a command line that's executing a script from a GitHub repository: https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/...\/WinPwn.ps1.\n\nI know that downloading scripts directly from such sources can be risky because they might contain malicious code. The fact that the same script is being downloaded multiple times suggests potential suspicious activity, maybe an attempt to execute a payload or gather information.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field, I see tasks labeled as 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These are common events related to service management in Windows, but when combined with the PowerShell commands, they might indicate something's amiss. Usually, these logs alone aren't indicators of compromise unless there's an unusual pattern or combination.\n\nThe file field is null in all cases, which means no files were accessed or modified during these events. So the focus remains on the process and Windows log activities.\n\nAnother point is that the script being executed includes parameters like '-noninteractive' and '-consoleoutput'. This suggests that the script is designed to run without user interaction and output data to the console, possibly for logging or display purposes, but it could also be a way to hide activity if misused.\n\nConsidering the frequency of these events—there are 15 instances where the same PowerShell command is executed—it's unusual unless this is part of an automated process. Without knowing the legitimate use case in this environment, such repeated attempts to execute external scripts can raise eyebrows, especially when they come from a third-party repository that isn't trusted.\n\nI'm also noticing some variation in the 'winlog' task fields towards the end. Some are 'Engine Lifecycle', which is less common than 'Provider Lifecycle'. This could be part of the script's execution process or an attempt to trigger different log entries for obfuscation purposes.\n\nPutting this all together, while each individual event might not be alarming, the combination—repeated PowerShell executions from a potentially risky source, specific task types in Windows logs, and the script's parameters—points towards possible malicious activity. This could be part of an attack chain, such as initial access or lateral movement within a network.\n\nIn this case, I would recommend investigating what the WinPwn.ps1 script does. If it's not known to be legitimate for the system, stopping these executions and reviewing network traffic might be necessary to ensure there's no ongoing compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"breach\": {\n    \"type\": \"suspicious_activity\",\n    \"description\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell commands executing an external script were detected.\",\n    \"recommendation\": \"Investigate the script source and consider isolating affected systems.\"\n  },\n  \"details\": {\n    \"command_pattern\": \"powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive ...}\",\n    \"script_url\": \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/...\/WinPwn.ps1\",\n    \"event_count\": 15,\n    \"log_tasks\": [\"Provider Lifecycle\", \"Engine Lifecycle\"]\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The first thing I notice is that the user provided multiple JSONL entries. I need to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not.\n\nStarting with the first event: it has a \"process\" field showing powershell.exe being executed with a command line argument that creates a new PowerShell drive mapping to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That looks suspicious because using PowerShell for remote operations can be a red flag, especially when it's trying to access another machine's C$ share, which is often used in attacks.\n\nThe subsequent events all have \"winlog\" entries indicating \"Execute a Remote Command\". This repetition is concerning. Multiple attempts to execute remote commands without any other activity might indicate an ongoing malicious process. It could be part of a script or automated attack trying different methods or multiple times to establish a connection.\n\nLooking at the files field, everything is marked as None, which means there's no file access being logged here. That makes me think it's purely command-line based activities, possibly remote code execution attempts without involving local files.\n\nPutting this together: The initial event sets up a drive mapping, and then multiple events follow trying to execute commands remotely. This pattern resembles an attack vector where the attacker is attempting to gain access or lateral movement within the network. The repetition of the same type of log entry could be part of a brute-force attempt or persistence mechanism.\n\nI'm confident enough that this batch shows potential malicious activity, so I'd classify it as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate repeated attempts to execute remote commands, potentially indicative of malicious activity. The initial event shows a PowerShell command attempting to map a drive to \\\\Target\\\\C$, which could be an attempt at unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
