{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is a process access task for powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that could be a red flag. But I need to look at the entire batch before making any conclusions.\n\nNext, there's a Process Create event for whoami.exe. Whoami is typically used to check user information, which is usually benign unless it's part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n\nThen again, another powershell.exe access event. It seems like PowerShell is being accessed multiple times here. That's something to note because repeated accesses could indicate scripting or malicious activities.\n\nLooking further, there's a Registry value set task for powershell.exe. Modifying the registry can be used in persistence mechanisms by attackers to ensure their scripts run on each boot. This adds another layer of concern.\n\nNow, this event has a command line argument for powershell.exe: \"& {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\". Breaking that down, the New-PSDrive cmdlet is used to create a new PowerShell drive. The target here is \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\", which seems like an attempt to map a network drive or access another system's C drive. This could indicate lateral movement within a network, which is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.\n\nAnother process access for powershell.exe follows, and then several Image Load events, all related to different DLL files. While these are normal operations when running scripts, the combination with other suspicious activities might be concerning.\n\nThere's a File Create event for a PowerShell script in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1\". Creating temporary scripts can be part of malicious activity, especially if they're later deleted or executed without proper permissions.\n\nFollowing that, there's a File Delete logged event for the same script. Deleting a file shortly after creating it might be an attempt to remove evidence, which is another red flag in security incidents.\n\nA Pipe Created event comes next, but without additional context, it's hard to say if this is part of normal operation or something malicious. However, PowerShell often uses pipes for communication between processes.\n\nMore Image Load events follow, and then another File Create event for a PowerShell profile. If an attacker is using a non-interactive session, they might create specific profile data to hide their tracks or execute additional commands during startup.\n\nLastly, another Registry value set task for powershell.exe. Combining multiple registry writes with other suspicious activities strengthens the case that this could be part of a larger attack vector.\n\nPutting all these together: repeated PowerShell accesses, creation and deletion of temporary scripts, network drive mapping attempts, registry modifications—all point towards potential malicious behavior. The batch shows several indicators of compromise typically seen in cyberattacks, such as persistence mechanisms, lateral movement attempts, and evidence tampering.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, including registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, and network drive mapping indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are from PowerShell.exe. That catches my attention because PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate scripting and for malicious activities like executing commands, downloading files, or accessing remote systems. Malware often uses PowerShell to hide its activity or execute code in-memory.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessed (ProcessAccess), which could indicate an attempt to interact with system processes or possibly inject code into them. Also, there's a command line showing \"& {}\" for one of the PowerShell executions. This might be a way to execute arbitrary commands, though in some cases it's used innocently, but it's still worth noting.\n\nThen there are several instances where files are created and deleted. For example, a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1 is created and then immediately deleted. This could be a sign of script execution testing permissions or trying to bypass certain policies. The fact that it's in the Temporary folder and later deleted might be an attempt to leave no trace, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs related to .NET and Windows Defender. While these could be legitimate, especially considering PowerShell relies on these libraries, the combination with other activities might raise suspicion. The loading of specific modules could be part of malicious script execution or attempting to gain persistence.\n\nThere's also a Process Create event for whoami.exe, which is often used to check user privileges. When combined with powershell.exe executions, this could indicate an attempt to elevate privileges or gather system information.\n\nConsidering all these events together—multiple PowerShell instances, file creation\/deletion, potential script execution—it seems like there might be malicious activity. The repeated actions and the use of tools known for both legitimate and malicious purposes make me lean towards classifying this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe instances with suspicious activities, including file creation\/deletion and potential script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system events is interesting or not. Let me start by going through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these entries are from powershell.exe. That's common because PowerShell is widely used, both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. So I need to be cautious here.\n\nLooking at the events, there are several instances where powershell.exe accesses processes (ProcessAccess) and sets registry values (RegistryEvent). These actions alone aren't necessarily suspicious, but when combined with other behaviors, they might raise a red flag.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is run. That command is often used to check user information, which in some contexts can be part of recon or privilege escalation, especially if it's automated or part of a larger script.\n\nI see that powershell.exe creates and then deletes a file in the Temp directory (__PSScriptPolicyTest_gbsqa1tg.2k0.ps1). Creating temporary files is normal, but deleting them immediately might be an attempt to cover tracks. Additionally, the fact that it's creating a PowerShell script in the Temp folder could be concerning if it's not part of a known process.\n\nAnother point is the multiple ImageLoad events for different DLLs. While these are standard when running scripts, the specific ones loaded here don't immediately ring alarm bells unless there's an unusual combination or version mismatch.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event in the StartupProfileData folder. This could be part of normal PowerShell profile initialization, but it might indicate something more if the file is created with certain permissions or content.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple process accesses, registry modifications, temporary script creation and deletion, loading various DLLs, and file operations. These behaviors could be indicative of a script trying to hide its presence or perform actions that require elevated privileges. However, they might also just be part of a legitimate script's execution flow.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of events suggests potential malicious activity. The creation and deletion of the temporary PowerShell script is particularly concerning, as it could be an attempt to execute arbitrary code or evade detection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications, process access, file creation\/deletion, and potential script execution detected in the logs.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm going to look through each event and see what's happening here.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving 'whoami.exe' being created as a process. That's usually a legitimate system command used to check user information, so on its own it might not be suspicious unless it's used in an unusual way. But in these logs, it's just running normally, so maybe nothing wrong there.\n\nThen, I see several events with 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used by administrators for scripting and can also be abused by attackers. Looking deeper, the command line in one event shows a script that exits if a specific file doesn't exist. That might be an attempt to check for something without doing anything obvious if it's not there. Also, multiple 'Process accessed' events could indicate that PowerShell is being used to interact with other processes, which can sometimes be part of malicious activities like process injection.\n\nThere are several image load events from different DLLs when running PowerShell. This is common since PowerShell uses various .NET components and DLLs for functionality. However, if some of these loads seem unusual or come from unexpected locations, it could be a red flag. But in this case, they're all standard system paths, so maybe not too concerning.\n\nAn interesting point is the creation of a temporary file '__PSScriptPolicyTest_h1gpo202.5ec.ps1' and then deleting it shortly after. Creating and immediately deleting files can be a tactic to avoid detection, as malicious actors might try to leave no trace. The fact that this script is being created suggests there was some scripting activity, which could be either benign or part of an attack.\n\nAnother event shows the creation of a file in 'C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft...' with a specific name. This path doesn't seem immediately suspicious, but creating files under different service profiles might be something to look into if it's not normal behavior for that service.\n\nLooking at all these together, there are signs that could indicate potential malicious activity: repeated PowerShell use, script creation and deletion, checking for the existence of a file (maybe a persistence mechanism), and process access events. However, without more context or evidence of actual malicious actions (like writing to unexpected places, network communications, etc.), it's hard to say definitively.\n\nOn the other hand, many of these activities could also be legitimate. For instance, whoami.exe is standard, and PowerShell is often used for system administration tasks which involve accessing processes and loading various modules.\n\nConsidering all this, while there are some red flags, they might not be conclusive enough on their own to classify this batch as definitely malicious. But the combination does raise an eyebrow, so I think it's worth looking into further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell activities including script creation and deletion, file checks, and image loads, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, a lot of them involve PowerShell.exe. I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities because it has powerful scripting capabilities. So whenever I see multiple entries from powershell.exe, especially with different log types like Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, and Process accessed, I should pay attention.\n\nThen there are events involving whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is typically used to get user information, which might seem innocent, but in some contexts, it could be part of an attack chain to gather system details or for persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother red flag is the cmd.exe command that was run: \"\/c netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off\". This command turns off Windows Defender Firewall. If this happens without legitimate cause, it might indicate someone trying to disable security features to facilitate further attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries of svchost.exe accessing the registry in various ways—setting values and objects. SvcHost is a common process for services, but malicious actors sometimes use it as a wrapper for their payloads. Unusual registry activity can be a sign of configuration changes or persistence mechanisms being set up.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple powershell.exe instances, execution of whoami.exe, disabling firewall via cmd and netsh, and svchost.exe registry manipulations—these collectively look suspicious. They could be part of an attack chain where the attacker is trying to establish persistence, disable defenses, gather information, and possibly drop malware.\n\nI should also consider if there's any pattern or timeline here. Are these events happening in quick succession? If so, that might indicate a deliberate sequence of malicious actions rather than coincidental legitimate activities.\n\nGiven all these points, I think the batch is definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell executions, registry modifications by svchost.exe, disabling firewall using netsh and cmd commands, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events, and each one is a JSON object. They all have the same structure. The process name is svchost.exe every time, and the winlog task is about a registry object being added or deleted with a specific rule called RegistryEvent. There's no file information in any of these events.\n\nHmm, svchost.exe is known to be a common system process used by various services. But it's also notorious because many malware tools use it as a host for malicious activities since it's typically allowed to run without much suspicion.\n\nThe registry activity seems significant here. Each event indicates that something in the Windows Registry has been modified—either an addition or deletion. Now, while normal system operations do involve registry changes (like installing software or updates), multiple such events from svchost.exe might be a red flag. Especially if they're happening frequently and without any corresponding legitimate activity.\n\nI also notice there are 25 events in total. That's quite a lot of registry modifications by the same process. Malware often uses registry keys to maintain persistence, store configuration data, or hide itself. Repeated writes or deletes could be part of such malicious activities trying to establish persistence across reboots or hide their tracks.\n\nSince there are no file references in these events, it's harder to link them directly to files on the system. But combined with the process name and repeated registry activity, it raises concerns about potential unauthorized access or植入ation.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because while individual svchost.exe processes might be normal, the volume of registry events stands out. It's possible that each event is a part of legitimate system operation, but without more context, it's risky to assume that. The high frequency and uniformity of these events make them worth investigating for potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events by svchost.exe may indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of logs to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of events where the process is svchost.exe. That's common because svchost is a system process that runs many services, so seeing it in logs isn't unusual. Each of these has a winlog task related to RegistryEvent—either adding or deleting objects or setting values. Registry modifications can be normal for legitimate software but also something attackers might do during installation or persistence.\n\nThen there are events where svchost.exe creates a pipe (Pipe Created). Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is standard, but sometimes malware uses them to communicate with other processes.\n\nThe next set of logs stands out. These involve powershell.exe being executed with the command line creating a new PS drive mapped to \\\\Target\\\\C$. This looks suspicious because it's trying to access another system (possibly over SMB). Using PowerShell for such operations is common in scripting, but it's also a tool often used by attackers for lateral movement or executing commands remotely.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with these powershell.exe events: Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle. These are typical when starting or stopping PowerShell sessions or modules, so they might not be malicious on their own. But combined with the command line, it raises an eyebrow.\n\nConsidering all together, there's a pattern here. Multiple registry changes could be part of setting up persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations. The pipe creation might indicate communication attempts. Most concerning is the PowerShell command attempting to access another machine, which could signal unauthorized access or lateral movement in a network. This combination makes me think this batch might be malicious activities.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure if these are all legitimate scripts or actual attacks. Maybe the script is part of system administration tasks, but the use of powershell.exe with such commands often raises red flags. Given that there are several repeated events, especially the svchost.exe ones, it could indicate a prolonged activity, possibly malicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because of the potential signs of unauthorized access and persistence mechanisms. The confidence is high because while some activities aren't outright bad, the combination suggests possible malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe, creation of pipes, and use of PowerShell to access remote systems suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL events, each with some process details and Windows logs. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, most of them have 'powershell.exe' as the command line. The command seems to be executing PowerShell scripts. In the initial events, there's a script that creates a new PSDrive with \"g\" as the name and points it to \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\". That looks suspicious because creating a mapped drive to another machine (like \\\\Target) might indicate lateral movement or accessing a remote system.\n\nBut then I see more events where the command line is just 'powershell.exe & {}'. These are probably empty scripts, maybe just invoking PowerShell without any malicious intent. But I need to consider all of them together.\n\nIn the middle, there's an event with a longer command that checks if \"procdump.exe\" exists in a specific path and exits based on that. ProCDump is often used for debugging, but it can also be a tool attackers might use to dump process memory. If they're checking its existence, maybe they're ensuring it's available for later use.\n\nI also notice variations in the 'winlog' task fields: some are 'Engine Lifecycle', others are 'Provider Lifecycle'. Not sure if that indicates anything specific, but combined with the PowerShell commands, it might suggest different stages of an attack.\n\nThere are a lot of repeated events, especially the ones where only 'powershell.exe & {}' is run. This repetition could be part of a script running multiple times or perhaps some legitimate process using PowerShell regularly. However, the initial command that attempted to connect to \\\\Target\\\\C$ stands out as potentially malicious. Also, the later checks for procdump.exe might indicate an attacker trying to prepare tools before executing something more harmful.\n\nI'm wondering if all these events are part of a sequence leading up to an attack. The initial attempt to map a drive could be failed or successful, but even if it's just an attempt, it's concerning. Plus, the use of procdump.exe might hint at process dumping for credential extraction or persistence.\n\nSo, considering all this together, there's a mix of potentially suspicious and possibly benign activity. But the combination of attempting to access a remote drive, using PowerShell, and checking for tools used in attacks makes the batch interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell commands that attempt to create a mapped drive to a remote target (\\\\Target\\\\C$) and check for procdump.exe, which could indicate malicious activity such as lateral movement or process dumping.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the user has provided two JSONL events that I need to analyze as a batch. My task is to determine if this batch is interesting or not for investigation based on these logs.\n\nFirst, looking at each event individually: both are process events from PowerShell. The command line seems to be checking if a specific file, procdump.exe, exists in a particular directory. If it does, the script exits with 0; otherwise, it exits with 1. \n\nHmm, I know that PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. So, scripts executing checks like this could be part of normal operations, such as ensuring required tools are present before proceeding. But sometimes attackers use such checks to avoid detection when dropping malware or performing actions only if certain conditions are met.\n\nThe events don't show any actual file access or execution beyond the check. There's no evidence of downloading files, writing to disk, or other suspicious activities. The fact that it's just checking for a file's presence might be benign. However, in some cases, this could be a precursor to more malicious behavior. \n\nBut wait, since both events are identical and there's no variation or follow-up actions, it seems less likely to be malicious. Maybe it's part of a system script that runs periodically. On the other hand, repeated checks without a clear purpose could raise flags.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no direct indication of malicious activity beyond a file check. The confidence level isn't too high but also not low, so maybe around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show PowerShell checking for the existence of a specific file and exiting based on its presence. This is likely a benign check or part of legitimate scripting activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
