{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an event from MpDefenderCoreService.exe with a network connection detected. That seems normal because Windows Defender is known to connect to update servers or check for threats. But I'll keep it in mind as part of the overall picture.\n\nNext, several entries are from chrome.exe showing DNS queries and network connections. Chrome regularly does this when browsing the web, so nothing suspicious here yet. It's just standard browser activity.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry events. Powershell is a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously. The fact that it's accessing processes and modifying the registry could be a red flag. I need to look deeper into these activities.\n\nLooking further, whoami.exe was run with no command line arguments. That seems benign as it's often used to check user permissions or system info. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nThere are cmd.exe instances with commands like 'dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key' and pipes using findstr for '.key'. This looks like someone is trying to search for files ending in .key, which could be sensitive keys or certificates. That's a bit worrying because enumerating such files might indicate intent to steal credentials.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command runs 'dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key' and then pipes it through findstr. Repeating the same command suggests maybe they're trying different ways to locate these files, possibly indicating persistence or multiple attempts.\n\nThere are entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files in a specific path. Winlogbeat is likely an ELK stack component used for log shipping, so this seems legitimate unless there's something odd about the file paths or permissions.\n\nPowershell.exe created a new text file named 'tarefa_geral.txt'. Without knowing what's inside, it's hard to say, but creating files can be part of malicious activities like dropping payloads or storing configurations.\n\nConhost.exe modifying registry values is another point to note. Conhost is often used in command-line interfaces; however, any changes to the registry could indicate persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell and cmd instances with potentially malicious commands, searching for .key files, creating new files, and registry modifications. These activities could be indicative of an attacker trying to gather information, establish persistence, or deploy malware.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of process creations, network activity, file operations, and registry changes suggests possible malicious behavior. The confidence isn't super high, maybe around 0.7, but there are enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry, along with cmd.exe commands searching for sensitive files (.key extensions) suggest potential malicious activity. Additionally, file creation events and process creations by winlogbeat.exe and conhost.exe add context to unusual system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by analyzing each event one by one.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so this seems normal and not suspicious.\n\nNext, RuntimeBroker.exe sets a registry value. Runtime Broker is part of Windows User Account Control and shouldn't be alarming on its own.\n\nNotepad.exe also sets a registry value. Notepad is a common application, and such actions are standard for system interactions.\n\nPowershell.exe accessed a process. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused. However, in this context, it's accessing another process which might not indicate malicious activity unless combined with other signs.\n\nCalc.exe loaded urlmon.dll. Calculator is benign, and URLMON is a legitimate Windows component for handling URLs.\n\nSVCHOST.exe setting registry values occurs multiple times. Svchost is a common process that runs many system services, so these actions are routine.\n\nAnother instance of winlogbeat creating a file again—nothing unusual here.\n\nCalculator.exe sets a registry value and loads urlmon.dll. Again, normal behavior for legitimate processes.\n\nThere's another powershell.exe setting a registry value and accessing a process.\n\nMultiple events from chrome.exe: it creates pipes, sets registry values, loads images like amsi.dll (Anti-Malware Scan Interface), and MpOAV.dll (Windows Defender related). These are standard activities for Chrome and its components.\n\nPutting it all together, the events don't show any red flags. They're all common system processes performing routine actions without signs of anomalies or malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as file creation by winlogbeat.exe, registry operations by common processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe, and standard image loading by Calculator.exe and Chrome.exe. There are no signs of unusual or malicious behavior across the events.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are three events here, each in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event.\n\nThe first event has the process name as powershell.exe. The winlog task mentions 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)'. I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. So this could be a red flag, but sometimes it's just normal usage, like running scripts or administrative tasks.\n\nThe second event is whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is typically a benign tool used to check user information. It doesn't have malicious capabilities by itself, unless it's part of some larger attack chain, like gathering credentials or system info for later use.\n\nLooking at the third event again, it's another powershell.exe process access. So now we see two instances of PowerShell being accessed within this batch. That repetition might be worth looking into because attackers often need to run scripts multiple times or in different contexts.\n\nI'm considering if these events together could indicate something malicious. For example, maybe someone is using PowerShell to execute commands and then verifying their permissions with whoami. This combination could be part of privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.\n\nOn the other hand, it's also possible that this is just routine admin activity—using PowerShell for scripting and checking user details. Without more context, like timestamps, user accounts involved, or additional events before\/after these, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nBut given that there are two PowerShell accesses and one whoami.exe execution in the same batch, I think there might be a reason to look closer. The fact that both powershell.exe and whoami.exe are present together could signal an attempt to gather information or execute commands, which raises my suspicion.\n\nSo, while individually these events aren't necessarily malicious, their combination increases the interest level for investigation. Therefore, I'd classify this batch as interesting with a moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains two instances of powershell.exe being accessed and one instance of whoami.exe being executed. This combination could indicate potential malicious activity such as scripting or information gathering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
