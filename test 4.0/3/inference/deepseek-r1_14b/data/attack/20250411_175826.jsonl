{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see that there are multiple entries from chrome.exe making network connections and doing DNS queries. That's normal because Chrome is a browser and it does need to connect to websites and resolve their domains. So, those might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nThen, there's some activity from powershell.exe. PowerShell can do a lot of things, both legitimate and malicious. I notice that it's accessing processes, creating new ones, and modifying the registry. For example, one event shows that powershell.exe is setting a registry value. That could be part of normal administration tasks, but it might also indicate something malicious, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe. This means it's loading various DLLs, which is common for scripts and can be part of legitimate operations, but again, sometimes attackers use this to load malicious libraries.\n\nI also see a file being created and then deleted by powershell.exe in the same location under AppData\\Local\\Temp. The filename has a .ps1 extension, which makes me think it's a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting temporary scripts can be part of legitimate activities, but it could also be used to execute malicious code temporarily to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying the registry. Notepad is typically harmless, but if it's making unexpected registry changes, that might be suspicious. Similarly, RuntimeBroker is related to Windows services, so its activity needs context but could still be part of normal operations.\n\nPutting this all together, the powershell.exe activities stand out because they involve multiple actions that could be indicators of malicious behavior: process access, registry modifications, loading images, creating and deleting a temp script file. While some of these actions are common, the combination might warrant further investigation to rule out any potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including registry modifications, image loads, file creation\/deletion in Temp directory, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial events, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe. The command lines show Get-ChildItem being used on various file paths, with the LastWriteTime being set to a very old date (01\/01\/1970). This seems suspicious because modifying file timestamps can be a tactic used by malware to avoid detection or to make changes appear legitimate.\n\nNext, there are several events where svchost.exe is involved. SvcHost is a common process in Windows, but repeated registry value sets could indicate malicious activity, especially if they're happening outside of normal operation times. This might be part of persistence mechanisms used by attackers.\n\nThen I see Calculator.exe and conhost.exe being loaded. These are typically benign processes, but the fact that urlmon.dll was loaded with them makes me a bit cautious. URLMON is related to handling URLs in Windows, so it's possible that these processes are trying to access network resources or execute code over the internet.\n\nThere's an event where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll from a specific path. That seems unusual because I know that Windows Defender updates regularly and wouldn't typically use such a specific version number. This could be an attempt to load malicious libraries using legitimate-looking file names, which is another red flag.\n\nAnother event shows conhost.exe modifying the registry, similar to svchost.exe. Again, while conhost is a standard command host for console applications, repeated registry modifications might not be normal unless part of an expected process.\n\nLooking at the last few events, there's a FileCreated event for a .yml file related to winlogbeat. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and forwarding logs, so this could just be it setting up its configuration. However, the path includes \"fiddelis\" which might be a user name, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file operations with unusual command lines, modifying timestamps on various files. These activities could indicate an attacker using PowerShell for lateral movement or data exfiltration. The svchost.exe and conhost.exe events are concerning because they often serve as a hiding spot for malicious processes, especially when combined with registry modifications. Additionally, the manipulation of Defender-related DLLs in powershell.exe could be part of an attempt to avoid detection by antivirus software.\n\nThe combination of these factors—multiple suspicious processes, unusual file operations, and potential anti-debugging or persistence mechanisms—increases the likelihood that this batch is indicative of malicious activity. While not all events are definitively malicious on their own, together they form a pattern that's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities with file timestamp modifications and potential anti-debugging behaviors.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. So, I've got 23 JSON objects here, each representing an event from system logs. My task is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\n1. The first event shows `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` setting a registry value. That seems normal because many legitimate processes interact with the registry.\n2. Next, `Calculator.exe` also sets a registry value. Again, this doesn't raise any red flags since Calculator is a standard app and might be part of some update or configuration process.\n3. Then there's `powershell.exe` setting a registry value. PowerShell is commonly used for system administration but can also be abused by attackers. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n4. Another `powershell.exe` event shows a process access task. Process access events can indicate legitimate activity or potential privilege escalation attempts. This could be something to look into.\n5. The next few events involve `chrome.exe` creating pipes and setting registry values repeatedly. Chrome is known for its extensions and plugins that might interact with the system, so some registry writes are expected.\n\nLooking further down:\n- There's an event where `winlogbeat.exe` creates a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of the log collection setup, so this seems benign.\n- Another event has `powershell.exe` creating a file named `unidade_logico.txt`. The name doesn't immediately suggest anything malicious, but it's worth noting that PowerShell can be used for file operations, which are common in both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nI notice multiple entries from Chrome setting registry values. While some might be legitimate (like extension installations or updates), the sheer number could indicate suspicious behavior, especially if these writes occur rapidly or target sensitive areas.\n\nThere are also events where processes load certain DLLs:\n- `amsi.dll` is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface, which is normal for system integrity checks.\n- `MpOAV.dll` relates to Windows Defender as well. So, these loads seem legitimate.\n\nConsidering the overall picture: there's a mix of common processes performing tasks like registry writes and file operations. While some actions could be indicative of malicious behavior (like multiple registry writes by Chrome or PowerShell), without additional context such as timestamps, user activity, or unusual permissions changes, it's challenging to conclusively determine malice.\n\nHowever, the repetition of registry writes by `chrome.exe` stands out. Malware often uses persistence techniques involving registry modifications. Additionally, PowerShell is a common tool for attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities. The creation of files without clear purpose could be an attempt to establish persistence or drop malicious payloads.\n\nOn the other hand, many of these events could be legitimate, especially if Chrome is being updated or extensions are installed. The `winlogbeat.exe` and file creations by `powershell.exe` might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are elements that, while individually common, together might suggest potential malicious activity. The high number of registry writes by Chrome and the use of PowerShell could warrant closer investigation to ensure these activities aren't part of a broader attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry value modifications, especially from non-standard processes like Chrome.exe, may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
