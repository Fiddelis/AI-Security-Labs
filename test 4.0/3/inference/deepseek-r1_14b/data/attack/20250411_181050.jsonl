{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let me try to piece together what's happening here.\n\nFirst, I see multiple processes being executed. There's chrome.exe, whoami.exe, powershell.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and others like cmd.exe and certutil.exe appearing several times. The repeated use of these tools might be a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools in their attacks to avoid detection.\n\nLooking closer at the command lines for some processes, especially cmd.exe and certutil.exe, I notice commands that seem suspicious. For example, one cmd.exe instance runs \"certutil -encode\" followed by paths like C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe. Wait a minute, calc.exe is typically benign, but using certutil to encode it might be part of an attempt to create a malicious payload or obfuscate files.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with unusual arguments. Powershell can do a lot of things, both legitimate and malicious. The command lines here don't seem to be standard administrative tasks; instead, they look like they could be part of an attack chain, maybe downloading or executing code.\n\nThere are also several events where registry values are being set by various processes like certutil.exe, cmd.exe, and even conhost.exe. Modifying the registry can be a way for malware to persist on the system. The fact that multiple different processes are interacting with the registry might indicate an attempt to create multiple points of persistence or alter system configurations in a way that's hard to detect.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file being created by certutil.exe at a temporary path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\modulo_logico_calc_decoded.exe. Temporary files can be used to stage malicious payloads, and the naming suggests it might be part of an execution chain.\n\nAnother red flag is the use of rundll32.exe with PcaSvc.dll. While rundll32 is a legitimate tool, certaindlls like PcaSvc can sometimes be exploited for attacks or used as part of exploit chains to gain higher privileges or execute code.\n\nMoreover, the repeated calls to ProcessCreate and RegistryEvent tasks in the winlog indicate that multiple processes are being spawned and registry modifications are happening frequently. This kind of activity is common during an attack where an adversary is deploying tools, creating backdoors, or moving laterally within a network.\n\nLooking at the overall sequence, it seems like there's a series of steps being taken: encoding files with certutil, writing to temporary locations, setting registry values for persistence, and possibly executing code through rundll32. This sequence could be part of a multi-step attack where an initial access is followed by lateral movement or payload delivery.\n\nI also notice that some processes load specific DLLs, like combase.dll and urlmon.dll, which are legitimate Windows components. However, if these are loaded in the context of suspicious processes (like SDXHelper.exe), it could be a sign of malicious activity trying to mimic normal operations.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a pattern of behavior that suggests potential malicious activity. The combination of using tools like certutil and powershell with unusual command lines, creating temporary files, modifying the registry, and invoking rundll32 with specific DLLs points towards an attack or at least suspicious activity worthy of investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple processes executing potentially malicious commands using legitimate tools like certutil.exe and powershell.exe, including attempts to encode\/decode files and modify the registry. This indicates possible attack activities such as payload generation or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system logs is something that should be investigated further. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, looking through each event, most of them are from Chrome.exe. There are a bunch of network connection detections and some registry value sets. Then there's an entry from powershell.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. Another one from SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a known Windows system file, so that seems normal. And finally, some more powershell.exe events about process access.\n\nHmm, Chrome doing network connections and registry changes isn't unusual. Browsers often interact with the network and might set some registry values for settings or extensions. So those in isolation don't raise flags.\n\nThe powershell.exe creating a file in Downloads caught my eye because that's where users typically download things. Could be innocent, like saving a script or config file, but it's something to look into more. Also, the process access events from powershell might indicate it's interacting with other processesâ€”maybe legitimate admin tasks or potentially malicious activity.\n\nThe SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal since that's part of Windows' URL handling components. No issue there.\n\nConsidering all together, the presence of multiple registry changes and file creation by powershell could be concerning. It might indicate some script or tool being used to modify system settings or persistence mechanisms. However, without more context like timestamps or other related events, it's hard to say definitively. But these actions are worth investigating because they can be signs of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry modifications and file creation by powershell.exe, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
