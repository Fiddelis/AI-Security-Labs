Let me go through each event one by one and see if anything stands out as potentially malicious.\n\nFirst event: Microsoft Edge update process changing file creation time. That's normal because updates often need to modify timestamps. No red flags here.\n\nNext, CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll. That sounds okay too; amsi is related to anti-malware scanning interfaces, which is standard.\n\nThen, setup.exe creating a pipe. I know that pipes are used for interprocess communication, but without more context, it's hard to say. Not sure if this is suspicious yet.\n\nServices.exe logon event and user account management tasks. These are typical Windows services activities. Nothing unusual here.\n\nLooking at the powershell.exe command line: It's using -ExecutionPolicy Restricted, which suggests it's running with limited privileges. The command checks for .inf files looking for specific patterns. That seems legitimate, maybe a script or tool checking system configurations. However, restricted execution policies are often used by attackers to avoid detection, but in this case, the script is reading system info, which could be either benign or part of an attack.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe loading Defender-related files. This is normal since it's Windows Defender components. No issues here.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe deleting a temp file. That's standard during updates; no problem.\n\nMultiple events involving MpCmdRun creating and loading files are all within expected Defender activities. So, nothing to worry about there.\n\nPutting it all together: Most events are routine system processes. The powershell script is interesting because of the restricted execution policy, but without more context, it's hard to classify as malicious. Since most other actions are normal, I'm leaning towards this batch being not particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist mostly of routine system activities and updates, with no clear indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}

Each event is a \"File created\" task under Windows log, specifically triggered by the FileCreate rule. The file paths all point to various JavaScript files within the node_modules\/semver directory.\n\nHmm, node_modules usually contains third-party libraries used in Node.js projects. Semver is a popular package for semantic versioning, so it's common for development environments. Git.exe creating these files sounds like part of the repository setup or during a clone, fetch, or install process where Node modules are being extracted or updated.\n\nI don't see any signs of suspicious activity here. The consistent and expected behavior aligns with normal software development processes. There's no indication of unusual file creation times, locations outside common directories, or attempts to create executable files. All the paths are within a standard project structure.\n\nConsidering all these points, this batch doesn't raise any red flags for malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating several JavaScript files in a node_modules directory, which is normal during development setup or updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. My task is to analyze this entire batch and determine if it's relevant for investigation by classifying it as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". I need to provide a concise justification along with my confidence level.\n\nLooking at the events, each one has three main components: process info, winlog details, and file information. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\", which makes me think this activity is related to Git operations. The task in the winlog is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so these are all about files being created.\n\nThe file paths are all under a user's Downloads folder, specifically within a course named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". Inside that, there's a node_modules directory with various package names. Examples include semver, serialize-javascript, set-blocking, and set-function-length. These are all Node.js packages, so it seems like someone is setting up or managing a Node project.\n\nEach event shows the creation of different files, including .js files, package.json, README.md, LICENSE, etc. This looks typical when installing or updating npm packages using Git. Since these are standard actions during development—cloning repositories, initializing projects, installing dependencies—the events don't raise any red flags related to security or malicious activity.\n\nI also note that all the processes are originating from git.exe, which is a common tool used for version control and managing node_modules. There's nothing unusual in the file paths; they're structured as expected for Node modules. No signs of hidden files, execution permissions, or other indicators of compromise are present here.\n\nConsidering the context, it's likely that this user is working on a software project using Git and npm. The creation of these files would be part of the normal setup process. Since there's no evidence of unauthorized access, suspicious file operations, or activities outside the expected workflow, I don't see any reason to flag this batch as interesting.\n\nTherefore, my classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because these events represent routine development actions rather than anything malicious or concerning. My confidence in this assessment is high, given the consistent and typical nature of each event.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple file creation events related to Node.js packages under a user's downloads directory, which are likely part of routine development activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the user has provided a batch of system log events in JSONL format and wants me to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at each event individually. Each line represents a JSON object with three main fields: process, winlog, and file. The process field shows that the name is \"git.exe\", which tells me this activity is related to Git, likely from a command-line interface or part of a development workflow.\n\nThe winlog task indicates that a file was created, specifically mentioning the rule \"FileCreate\". So each event is about a file creation action by git.exe. Looking at the file paths, they all seem to be within a user's Downloads directory under a folder named after a course: \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". The files being created are various Node.js modules like set-function-length, shebang-command, etc., along with their associated package.json and readme.md files. There are also some editor configs and other standard project files.\n\nNow, thinking about the user's context—they're a cybersecurity expert analyzing logs for malicious behavior. So I need to consider whether these file creations are normal or potentially suspicious. Since git.exe is being used, it's possible that this activity is part of cloning a repository or installing dependencies, which would be legitimate actions in a development environment.\n\nThe fact that all events are from the same process (git.exe) and relate to creating files within a node_modules directory suggests that this is during a Node.js package installation. The file paths include both code files and standard project configuration files, which aligns with typical npm install behavior.\n\nI also notice that there's a consistent pattern in the file creation events—each module has its package.json, index files, and sometimes readme or changelog files. This repetition makes me think it's part of a bulk process rather than individual manual actions, but again, this is expected during development setup.\n\nConsidering potential malicious activities, indicators would include things like unexpected processes, unusual file paths, creation of hidden files, or execution of scripts without user interaction. Here, everything seems to be in plain sight within a standard project structure, which doesn't raise red flags.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that all these events are happening together suggests they might be part of a single operation, perhaps triggered by a script or automated process as part of building a project. There's no evidence of any writes to restricted directories or files outside the expected project scope.\n\nIn terms of confidence, while it's possible for an attacker to mimic such behavior, the lack of anomalies and the consistency with normal development activities make me lean towards this not being malicious. The user is likely in a controlled environment where installing dependencies is a regular occurrence, so these logs are part of that process rather than something suspicious.\n\nTherefore, putting all this together, I don't see any red flags or signs of malicious behavior in this batch of events. They appear to be legitimate file creation activities related to Node.js module installations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of files during a Git operation, likely part of a normal development process involving Node.js modules.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

That looks like a directory path for a user's downloads, specifically within an 'inatel' folder. The files being created are in node_modules and various subdirectories under that. These include things like index.js, signature.js, utils.js, man1 files, package.json, license, readme.md, etc.\n\nGiven that the process is git.exe, which is commonly used for version control, it's likely that these events are part of a Git operation. Creating files in node_modules suggests that maybe this user is setting up or updating a Node.js project, perhaps installing dependencies using npm. The creation of package.json and readme.md files is typical during the initialization of a new Node project.\n\nLooking at each event individually, they all seem normal for someone working with Node.js and Git. The repetition of creating multiple files in node_modules could be part of cloning a repository or running npm install. None of these actions inherently look suspicious. There's no indication of unusual file paths or access to sensitive areas outside the project directory.\n\nI'm also considering whether git.exe being used to create files is an uncommon behavior that might indicate malicious activity. But generally, Git is a standard tool for developers, and creating files during checkout or sync isn't unusual. The fact that all events are coming from the same user's download directory and relate to a single project makes me think it's legitimate development work.\n\nI don't see any signs of privilege escalation, use of known malicious file names, or activities outside normal user behavior. All the paths are within expected areas for a Node.js setup. There’s no evidence of files being deleted, accessed inappropriately, or modified in ways that would raise red flags.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events don't seem interesting from a security standpoint.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at these events. So, there are 11 JSON objects here, each representing an event. The common thread I see is that all of them involve the creation of files by the process \"git.exe\". Each event logs that a file was created in the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\. The filenames vary, but they're all .js files related to the 'tcomb' library.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about what \"git.exe\" typically does. Git is a version control system, and when you clone a repository or add dependencies, it downloads packages which might include various modules. Node.js modules often have several files, so seeing multiple file creations in a node_modules directory seems normal during the installation or update of JavaScript packages.\n\nI also notice that each event is marked as \"File created\" with a specific rule. This suggests that the system is monitoring for file creation events, which could be part of standard logging practices to track changes on the filesystem. There's nothing unusual about Git creating files in its usual directories during normal operations.\n\nLooking at the paths, they all point to different JavaScript files within the tcomb library. Since tcomb is a known npm package used for type checking in Node.js applications, having these files created by Git is consistent with typical development activities, such as downloading dependencies or syncing repositories.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious behavior here? I don't see anything that stands out. No signs of file deletions, access to sensitive areas outside the project directory, or unexpected processes. All events are straightforward file creations in a standard location for node_modules.\n\nI should also consider if the fact that multiple files are being created is concerning. In this context, it's actually expected behavior when installing or updating dependencies. Git often clones or fetches multiple files at once, especially from repositories with many modules.\n\nCould there be an alternative explanation? Maybe someone manually extracting these files or moving them, but given that all events come from git.exe, it seems more like automated package management rather than manual intervention.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm pretty sure this is normal activity. There's no deviation from what would typically happen during development work with Node.js and Git. Unless there's additional context indicating unusual behavior, such as these files being created outside the expected directories or in a different manner, I wouldn't flag this for investigation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each event is part of a legitimate process related to software development, specifically managing Node.js modules with Git. There's no evidence of malicious intent or abnormal activity that would warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creations by git.exe in a standard node_modules directory, which is typical during package installation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
