Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is mmc.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because MMC is a legitimate tool used for managing system components like the Registry.\n\nNext, there's PowerShell being created without any command line arguments. I know that PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But this alone isn't suspicious unless combined with other actions.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These seem related to .NET framework components, which makes sense since PowerShell uses the .NET Framework.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created in the Temporary Internet Files directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1. This seems unusual because it's a script file being created there. However, I'm not sure if this is part of normal operations or something else. But then the same file is deleted right after creation, which might indicate a test or some automated process.\n\nAnother event shows the creation ofteste.ps1 in the Downloads folder. Again, scripts can be benign or malicious, but without more context, it's hard to say. The use of \"teste\" suggests maybe testing purposes, but could also be evasion tactics.\n\nThere are multiple Provider Lifecycle events from PowerShell, which I think relate to event logging setup and might not be concerning on their own.\n\nThe last few events again involve loading the same DLLs and accessing registry values. This repetition makes me think it's part of a larger script execution, possibly checking permissions or setting configurations.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell instances being created, loading expected .NET components, creating temporary scripts which are then deleted, and executingteste.ps1 with an ExecutionPolicy Bypass flag. The use of -ExecutionPolicy Bypass is a red flag because attackers often bypass default policies to run scripts they shouldn't. This combined with the creation and deletion of temporary script files suggests potential malicious activity, like testing or deploying a payload.\n\nI'm also considering that sometimes legitimate scripts might do this, but given the number of events and the specific actions, it's more likely indicative of an attack. Therefore, I'd classify this batch as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances show suspicious activity including script execution and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of three events related to PowerShell.exe activities. The first two entries show file creation and deletion in the same temporary path, which could be part of a script test or cleanup routine. The third event is about creating a file in a more legitimate Windows PowerShell directory.\n\nI need to assess if these actions together are suspicious. Temporary files created by scripts might be normal, especially during testing. The repeated creation and deletion of the same file suggests it's part of a process that handles its own cleanup, which isn't necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nThe file paths themselves don't raise immediate red flags. They're in standard directories used by Windows or user applications. Without more context, like unusual file hashes or persistence mechanisms, there's no strong indication of malicious intent.\n\nSo, considering all events together, they might not be significant enough for an investigation unless there's additional data indicating suspicious behavior elsewhere.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve normal PowerShell.exe activities such as file creation and deletion in temporary directories, which are typical behaviors during script execution or testing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
