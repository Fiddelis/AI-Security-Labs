{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. I'm going to go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, the first two events are from chrome.exe indicating network connections. That's normal, especially for a browser, so probably nothing malicious there.\n\nNext up is an event from powershell.exe where it set a registry value. PowerShell can be used for legitimate tasks but is often abused in attacks. So this catches my attention. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nThen there's a detailed process creation event for powershell.exe with a command line that looks like it's running multiple commands. The commands include net user, get-localuser, and others related to system information. That seems suspicious because attackers often gather information about the system using such commands.\n\nLooking further, there are events where powershell.exe accesses another process, which might indicate lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts. Then more registry writes, similar to the earlier ones—so consistent with potential malicious activity.\n\nThe file creation and subsequent deletion of a .ps1 script in the Temp directory is concerning. Attackers often drop scripts temporarily and then delete them to avoid detection. This behavior could be part of an attack chain, like persistence or execution.\n\nMultiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events from powershell.exe might be related to loading modules or extending functionality, which can be a red flag if it's not expected activity.\n\nLastly, the event where a pipe is created in PowerShell. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication but can also be abused by malware for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated powershell.exe activities with network connections, registry modifications, file operations, and suspicious command-line arguments suggest potential malicious behavior. The script being dropped and deleted is a classic sign of an attacker trying to stay under the radar. Therefore, this batch should be classified as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes show suspicious activity including registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in Temp directory, and network-related tasks which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system logs to analyze. My job is to figure out if these events are interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's 'winlogbeat.exe' which seems like it's part of the ELK stack for log management, so that's probably benign. Then there's a lot of PowerShell activity, which is a red flag because it's often used in scripting and can be abused for malicious purposes.\n\nI notice two events where PowerShell is called with command lines that include commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-localgroupmember', etc. These are system administration commands that could be part of privilege escalation or information gathering by an attacker. The use of multiple network utilities and directory listings might indicate someone trying to map out the system or network.\n\nThere's also a command line with several backslashes, which is a bit odd but not necessarily malicious on its own. However, when combined with other suspicious activities, it could be part of a larger script intended to perform unauthorized actions.\n\nAnother point is the creation of files by PowerShell, specifically 'pacote_ativo.txt'. Creating new files can be part of data exfiltration or setting up persistence mechanisms. It's worth investigating what this file contains and how it was used.\n\nLooking at other processes like 'chrome.exe' modifying registry values multiple times might just be regular user activity, but if these changes are unusual or affect security-related areas, they could warrant closer look. The 'updater.exe' from Google is more likely benign, as it's handling updates, but the command line parameters show network communication and crash handling, which seems normal unless there's an anomaly.\n\nThe 'cmdkey.exe \/list' command stands out because it retrieves cached credentials. If an attacker runs this, they can capture stored passwords, leading to potential unauthorized access. This definitely raises the red flag for possible credential dumping.\n\nAlso, multiple events where processes are created or accessed by PowerShell and other tools could indicate lateral movement within a network. The repetition of 'Process Create' tasks might suggest that several scripts or malicious processes are being initiated, which is concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of high-privilege commands, potential credential access, file creation, and process manipulation. These activities don't align with typical user behavior and could be signs of an active attack or penetration attempt. Therefore, the batch as a whole seems relevant for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious processes including PowerShell command lines indicating potential system enumeration and credential access activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. I'm looking at a batch of system log events and need to determine if they're interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first event is the process \"net1.exe\" with the command line pointing to net localgroup. That seems like it's related to network group commands, maybe setting up user groups over the network. Not immediately suspicious, but could be part of a script or legitimate activity.\n\nNext, powershell.exe is creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. PowerShell is commonly used for both good and bad things, so this catches my attention. Creating files in non-standard locations might indicate something malicious, especially if it's trying to persist across reboots by adding scripts to startup.\n\nThen there are two more events from powershell.exe: one setting a registry value and another creating a file called modulo_base.txt. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes for malicious activities. The file name \"modulo_base\" doesn't ring any bells immediately, but it's worth noting that it's being created by PowerShell.\n\nConhost.exe is involved in setting a registry value. Conhost is often associated with legitimate processes, like the Windows Console Host, so maybe this isn't suspicious on its own unless there's an unusual path or action.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating files in its data directory seems normal if that's part of log management. However, seeing it multiple times might indicate something about how logs are being handled, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nSDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll is interesting because URLMON.DLL is related to URL handling and could be used for downloading or executing code. This could be part of a download process or potentially something more nefarious like a payload delivery.\n\nLooking at the svchost.exe entries, they're setting registry values again. SvcHost is known for hosting various Windows services, but sometimes it's used by malware to hide their processes under legitimate service names. Multiple registry writes from svchost might be a red flag, especially if combined with other suspicious activities.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe loading taskschd.dll seems normal as part of update processes, but again, any process loading unusual DLLs could be worth monitoring.\n\nBackgroundTaskHost.exe also loads urlmon.dll, similar to SDXHelper. This repetition of URLMON usage across different processes might indicate some coordinated activity, possibly related to downloading or executing code.\n\nWinlogbeat creating the same .winlogbeat.yml file multiple times makes me wonder if there's a loop or script running that's causing repeated writes, which could be an issue if it's causing log bloat or indicating interference with log management.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event accessing a process—this might be part of some inter-process communication or privilege escalation. Combined with the other events, this adds to the suspicion.\n\nPutting it all together, I see multiple instances where PowerShell is being used to create files and modify registry settings. These actions are often used in persistence mechanisms by attackers to ensure their malicious activities continue after a system restart. The use of net1.exe for group commands and the repeated loading of urlmon.dll across different processes might be part of a larger campaign, possibly indicating remote access or lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry modifications and file creations from various processes could indicate an attempt to establish persistence, gather information, or deploy additional tools. This combination raises concern that there's potentially malicious activity occurring, making the batch of events interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell file creations and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
