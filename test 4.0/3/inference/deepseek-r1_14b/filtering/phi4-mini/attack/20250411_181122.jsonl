{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them involve powershell.exe being executed with specific command lines. The command line seems to be searching for files containing certain keywords like 'pass' in various file types such as .xml, .doc, .txt, and .xls. This kind of activity could be part of data exfiltration or credential harvesting.\n\nThe first event is whoami.exe being executed, which on its own isn't suspicious because it's a common system command to get user information. But paired with the other events, it might not add much here.\n\nThen there are multiple instances where powershell.exe accesses registry values and loads images (like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll). These activities could be normal for Powershell scripts, but combined with the specific file searches, they raise an eyebrow. Registry access is often used in malicious scripts to check or modify system configurations.\n\nI also notice that a temporary PowerShell script was created and then immediately deleted. This behavior is common in malware to avoid detection since the malicious script doesn't linger on disk. The fact that it's deleting the file after creation suggests something might be off.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries with similar command lines executing the same search pattern. Repeated attempts to look for sensitive information like passwords could indicate a brute-force attempt or data mining. The use of 'select-string' in the command line is another red flag because it's often used to parse logs or files for specific patterns, which might be malicious.\n\nThe events also mention pipe creation. This can allow communication between processes, potentially enabling command and control functionality or data transfer between different malicious components.\n\nPutting all this together, the combination of searching for sensitive keywords across various file types, creating and deleting temporary scripts, repeated process creations with suspicious commands, and registry accesses suggests possible malicious activity. These activities don't align with normal user behavior and could be indicators of an attack.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the patterns observed are indicative of potential unauthorized access or data theft.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity including searching for sensitive keywords, creating and deleting temporary scripts, and repeated process creations suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from different processes like powershell.exe, findstr.exe, chrome.exe, etc. Powershell is often used by attackers because it has built-in capabilities for various tasks, including malicious ones. I notice a command line in one of the powershell events: \"& {findstr \/si pass *.xml...\". This looks like it's searching for files containing \"pass\" and then using select-string to find patterns matching \"password.\" That seems suspicious because an attacker might be trying to extract passwords.\n\nLooking further, there are several registry value sets by various processes, including svchost.exe, which is a known process that can be used maliciously as it's part of system services. Also, multiple instances of chrome.exe modifying the registry could indicate something fishy since Chrome usually doesn't do that unless it's being manipulated.\n\nAnother point is that powershell.exe is involved in creating files and accessing processes. For example, one event shows a file being created in the user's profile directory with a name related to PowerShell startup data. That might be an attempt to persist malicious scripts across sessions or logins, which is a common tactic for attackers.\n\nAdditionally, there are process creation events for findstr.exe, which was used in the command line mentioned earlier. This could be part of a chain where one legitimate tool (findstr) is used to execute malicious commands via powershell.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes involved in searching for sensitive information, creating files in user directories, and modifying system settings like the registryâ€”all these activities are red flags that suggest potential malicious behavior. The repetition of certain actions by different processes also raises suspicion because it might be part of a coordinated attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities, including powershell.exe searching for sensitive information and creating files in user directories, along with registry modifications that could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from chrome.exe performing DNS queries and registry operations. These could be normal browser activities like accessing websites or managing settings, so not too concerning on their own.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating files in the data directory. Since winlogbeat is a known log shipping tool, this activity seems legitimate and part of its normal operation to collect logs.\n\nI see powershell.exe creating files named 'objeto_logico.txt' and 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to be cautious. Creating files could be part of script execution, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThere are a couple of process access events from powershell.exe. Again, powershell has many uses, including administrative tasks, so these might not indicate anything suspicious yet.\n\nFinally, there's a whoami.exe run, which is often used by scripts or users to check their permissions. This could be normal activity or part of recon efforts.\n\nLooking at the combination of events: multiple registry accesses from chrome.exe and powershell.exe, file creations that aren't clearly malicious but could be part of script execution, and the use of whoami. While some activities raise flags, like the file names and the process access events, without additional context or indicators of compromise (IoCs), it's difficult to confirm malicious intent.\n\nSo, considering all events together, there are some red flags but not enough concrete evidence to classify this batch as definitely suspicious. Therefore, I would mark it as NOT INTERESTING with a moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal user activities and legitimate processes like Chrome browsing, PowerShell script execution, and log file creation by winlogbeat.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: cmd.exe is running a command that deletes some scheduled tasks and redirects output. Scheduled task deletions can be part of malware trying to clean up traces.\n\nNext, powershell.exe is accessed, which is often used maliciously because it's powerful for scripting.\n\nThen, another cmd.exe sets a registry value, but I'm not sure what that does yet.\n\nThe fourth event has schtasks.exe deleting another scheduled task. Multiple deletions of tasks might indicate an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the next few events, schtasks and svchost are involved in registry changes. Svchost is usually legitimate, but it's being flagged here for some reason.\n\nThere's a cmd.exe process deleting notepad.exe processes using WMIC. Deleting Notepad could be trying to cover up its usage or remove evidence.\n\nAnother powershell event accessing and modifying the registry stands out. Powershell has administrative privileges, so that's concerning.\n\nI see multiple instances of schtasks.exe deleting tasks with similar naming conventions like \"_005_OnLogon\". This pattern suggests a coordinated effort to remove scheduled tasks, possibly to avoid detection or persistence.\n\nAlso, the use of WMIC to delete processes is another red flag. Malware often uses such techniques to terminate processes without being detected by standard monitoring tools.\n\nThe combination of deleting tasks, registry modifications, and process deletions with similar command lines across different executables like cmd.exe and WMIC indicates a potential attack. These activities could be part of an attempt to clean up or hide malicious actions, which makes the batch significant for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving process creations and deletions, registry modifications, and the use of tools like cmd.exe and WMIC in ways that may indicate attempts to delete or modify system processes and scheduled tasks, which could be indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Event 1**: Powershell.exe accessed.\n2. **Event 2**: whoami.exe created with a normal path.\n3. **Event 3**: Powershell.exe accessed again.\n4. **Event 4**: Powershell.exe accessed and modified the registry.\n5. **Event 5**: cmd.exe executed a command to delete a user: \"net user \/del\".\n6. **Event 6**: Powershell.exe accessed once more.\n7. **Event 7**: cmd.exe modified the registry.\n8. **Event 8**: net.exe used to delete another user.\n9. **Event 9**: net1.exe deleted a user via command line.\n10. **Event 10**: conhost.exe modified the registry.\n11. **Event 11**: Powershell.exe accessed again.\n12. **Event 12**: whoami.exe created again.\n13. **Event 13**: Powershell.exe accessed again.\n14. **Event 14**: cmd.exe ran a command to delete another user with more parameters.\n15. **Event 15**: net.exe deleted another user, specifying domain.\n16. **Event 16**: net1.exe deleted yet another user via command line.\n17. **Event 17**: cmd.exe modified the registry again.\n18. **Event 18**: conhost.exe modified the registry once more.\n\nLooking at these events, I notice a pattern of multiple processes (Powershell, cmd, net, net1) being used to delete various users. The command-line arguments in events like `net user \/del` and `cmd.exe \/c net user ... >nul 2>&1` are red flags because they indicate attempts to remove user accounts, which could be part of an attack.\n\nThe repetition of these commands suggests a possible automated or script-driven attempt to delete multiple users. This behavior isn't typical for normal system operations unless there's a legitimate cleanup process, but the use of different tools and the fact that many events involve deleting admin-level users (like *_Admin) makes it suspicious.\n\nAlso, Powershell.exe is commonly used in attacks because it can execute commands and access the registry, which was seen in multiple events. Registry modifications could be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of user deletions using various methods and tools raises concerns about potential malicious activity. Therefore, investigating this batch would likely yield valuable insights into possible security incidents.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of user deletion commands (e.g., 'net user \/del') executed using different tools like cmd.exe and net.exe, along with powershell.exe access and registry modifications, indicate potential malicious activity targeting account compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events and figure out if they're interesting or not. So, each event is in JSONL format with process info, winlog data, and sometimes file info.\n\nFirst off, I notice a lot of cmd.exe and powershell.exe processes being created or accessed. For example, there's a cmd.exe running \"\/c sc delete win32times\". That \"sc delete\" command stands outâ€”itâ€™s used to remove services. Maybe theyâ€™re trying to disable something. Then there are multiple instances where Registry values are set or objects are added\/deleted. That makes me think someone is modifying system configurations, which could be part of malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, I see cmd.exe deleting files in the Temp directory. The command uses del with specific filenames and redirects output to null, which is common in scripts to hide output. Deleting files in Temp might be an attempt to remove traces or clean up after some activity.\n\nThere are several powershell.exe processes being accessed or created. Powershell can do a lot, both good and bad. But the fact that it's being used multiple times without clear legitimate reasons (like system admin tasks) makes me suspicious. Also, thereâ€™s a cmd.exe command with \"& {}\" in the command lineâ€”this seems unusual and possibly indicative of script injection or malicious commands.\n\nThe repeated use of Registry modifications is another red flag. Malware often manipulates the registry to persist itself or change system settings. Plus, processes like whoami.exe being executed might be for privilege escalation or information gathering.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of process creation with potential malicious intent (sc delete, file deletions in Temp), repeated Registry modifications, and suspicious use of powershell.exe. These activities don't seem to align with normal user behavior. It looks like someone is trying to hide their tracks or modify system settings in a way that could indicate an attack.\n\nSo, I think this batch is definitely interesting for investigation because the combination of these events suggests possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including service deletion, registry modifications, file deletions in Temp directory, and repeated powershell.exe usage suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system events is interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nThe first few events are all related to powershell.exe. The process is being created, accessed, and there's a lot of activity around registry changes and file operations. For example, the script creates a temporary .ps1 file and then deletes it right after. That seems suspicious because creating and deleting scripts quickly can be a way to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe loads mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET. Sometimes malicious scripts use these libraries for obfuscation or execution of code. Plus, the script accesses the Windows Defender directory, which might indicate attempts to bypass security measures.\n\nI notice that conhost.exe is involved too, accessing the registry. Conhost is often used by PowerShell to host its console window, but seeing it do registry operations without a clear reason could be a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of whoami.exe being executed. Whoami typically just tells system information, but executing it so many times might not be normal unless something is trying to gather info about the user repeatedly.\n\nLooking at all these together: powershell.exe creating temporary files, accessing registry for persistence or privileges, and multiple process creations with whoamiâ€”this pattern could indicate malicious activity like script execution, privilege escalation, or information gathering. The repeated process accesses might suggest an attempt to hide or establish persistence in the system.\n\nSo putting it all together, these events don't look like normal user behavior. They show signs of potential attack vectors, so I'd classify this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and repeated process creations with whoami.exe suggest potential malicious behavior or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed or created. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate admin tasks, but it can also be abused by attackers. So, repeated access might be suspicious. There are four instances of Process Create or accessed for PowerShell. That stands out to me.\n\nThen, I see whoami.exe running multiple times. Whoami is usually harmless and used to get user info. But since it's called several times, maybe in conjunction with other scripts, it could be part of some activity that's trying to gather information about the system or users. Not sure if that's malicious on its own, but combined with PowerShell, it might be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are events where processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and Calculator.exe are accessing registry values. These are standard system processes, so their activity in the registry isn't unusual. However, frequent modifications could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe created a file. Winlogbeat is likely part of log management tools, maybe Elastic Beat for forwarding logs to Elasticsearch. Its file creation event might be normal if it's setting up configurations, but it's worth noting because sometimes attackers use such tools for data exfiltration.\n\nThen, there are multiple network connection events from chrome.exe. While Chrome is a common browser, multiple network connections could mean legitimate browsing activity or something more nefarious like data being sent out in quick succession. Without knowing the specifics of each connection, it's hard to say, but it's another point to consider.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell accesses and whoami.exe runs, process creations, registry modifications, a log file creation, and several network connections from different processes. While individually these might not be alarming, the combination suggests possible malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell could indicate scripting for privilege escalation or lateral movement. Registry changes by various processes might be setting up persistence points. Network traffic from Chrome could be part of data exfiltration.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the pattern doesn't seem entirely normal. However, there's a chance it's just legitimate user activity with some tools being used more than usual. My confidence is around 0.6 because while there are signs that merit closer look, they might not all be malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creations and accesses involving PowerShell and whoami.exe, along with registry modifications and network activity, suggest potential malicious behavior or suspicious scripting activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
