{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events provided in JSONL format. My goal is to determine if this entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process name is 'powershell.exe' and the command line shows the creation of scheduled tasks using powershell commands. These commands seem suspicious because they're setting up tasks that run at logon with elevated privileges, which could be an indicator of malicious activity. Specifically, the task actions execute calc.exe, a common tool used in attacks to pivot or perform further actions.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where 'powershell.exe' is accessing registry values and processes. These activities can often be part of persistence mechanisms or lateral movement within a network, which are red flags for potential compromise.\n\nHowever, I also see entries involving 'chrome.exe' creating pipes and loading image files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. While these could be normal operations since Chrome is a legitimate application, the combination with other suspicious powershell activities raises concern. The repeated use of powershell to create scheduled tasks suggests an attempt to establish persistence or execute arbitrary commands at logon, which is concerning.\n\nTaking all events together, the repeated powershell executions, registry modifications, and image loads, along with the creation of multiple scheduled tasks, are significant. These behaviors don't appear to be normal user activities and could indicate a potential breach or malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including creating scheduled tasks executing calc.exe with elevated privileges and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here.\n\nFirst off, I see multiple events from powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used for malicious activities. The first few entries show that ImageLoad tasks were logged. So, PowerShell is loading some images. One loads mscorlib.ni.dll which is legitimate, but another loads MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, which are from Windows Defender. That seems normal.\n\nThen there's a file creation event for a temp script: __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. Creating a temporary PowerShell script could be part of testing or legitimate scripting, but it can also be used in attacks to bypass certain policies. After that, the same file is deleted. So someone created and then removed a script quickly—maybe trying to avoid detection.\n\nNext, there's a command line argument for powershell.exe. It looks like they're setting up a scheduled task to execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges. That seems suspicious because creating a scheduled task that runs at logon with admin rights can be used by attackers to maintain persistence or escalate privileges. The fact that the same script is run twice might indicate an attempt to ensure the malicious task is registered.\n\nThen, there are several events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings, multiple such events could be a sign of something else, but alone they're not too concerning unless linked to other activities.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple entries where 'Execute a Remote Command' is logged with no process or file info. This is worrying because it's vague and hard to trace. It suggests that some remote command was executed without much detail—maybe indicating communication with an external server for malicious purposes.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows powershell.exe creating a suspicious script, deleting it, setting up a scheduled task to run calc.exe at logon as admin, and multiple attempts to execute remote commands. These actions could be part of a broader attack campaign. The repeated use of powershell with elevated privileges and the creation\/deletion of scripts are strong indicators of potential malicious activity.\n\nI'm also considering that some of these activities might be false positives if it's an internal script or admin activity, but given the combination—especially the scheduled task setup to run calc.exe which is typically benign but here could indicate a persistence mechanism—it leans towards being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including PowerShell command line arguments setting up a scheduled task to execute calc.exe with admin privileges, creation and deletion of a temporary script file, and multiple remote command executions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, the first event is from WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal because those are Windows-related processes. Next, there are multiple entries of svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process, so some registry activity might be typical, but repeated writes could be suspicious.\n\nThen, another svchost.exe creates a file in the Tasks folder: \"unidade_comum\". I'm not sure what that means, but creating files there might indicate something malicious, like setting up a task to run at startup. \n\nThere's an event where the process is None, and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command.\" That sounds concerning because it could imply some kind of remote execution without a legitimate process context.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creates a file in the user's AppData folder under PowerShell StartupProfileData. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripts and malicious activities, so this might be something to look into. Another powershell.exe event sets a registry value, which again could be part of setting up persistence or configuration.\n\nConhost.exe, another system-related process, also sets a registry value. Not sure about that one; conhost is usually associated with console windows but shouldn't do much in terms of registry changes.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe processes are involved in various activities: loading images, setting registry values, and making DNS queries. While Chrome can do a lot, the repeated registry writes from Chrome could be suspicious if they're not part of its normal operation. Also, the DNS query might be checking for something malicious.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe is creating configuration files in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is an ELK tool for log management, so this seems legitimate unless it's being misused.\n\nPowershell again creates another file: \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\". Powershell is a favorite for attackers because of its scripting capabilities. Creating multiple text files might be part of data exfiltration or setting up stages for an attack.\n\nPutting all these together, the batch shows several red flags: remote command execution, powershell activity, svchost and chrome making unusual registry changes, and file creations in non-standard locations. These could indicate a potential malicious activity like persistence, credential dumping, or lateral movement within a network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including remote command execution, powershell script creation, svchost registry modifications, and chrome.exe behavior suggest potential malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
