{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I'm looking at a batch of system log events and need to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from Chrome.exe, which is showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because browsers do make such connections as part of their operation. So, these alone might not be suspicious unless there's an unusual volume or pattern, but in this case, it looks typical.\n\nThen, I see several entries involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it can also be a vector for attacks. Looking at the command lines, I notice that some of them are downloading files from GitHub repositories. The URLs point to raw.githubusercontent.com, which isn't inherently malicious, but the paths suggest they're fetching text files (LICENSE.txt). However, in one case, there's an attempt to download a script with .ps1 extension using powershell.exe, which is more concerning because script execution can lead to malicious activities.\n\nMoreover, the events show file creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts. This behavior could be indicative of scripting or command injection attempts. The repeated downloading from different GitHub paths might suggest automated testing or multiple attempts to execute code, which raises suspicion about potential malicious intent.\n\nAlso, there are several registry modifications detected with powershell.exe, which can be a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools to modify system configurations for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—the use of PowerShell with command-line arguments downloading files, the creation and deletion of temporary scripts, and multiple instances—this batch shows signs of potentially malicious activity. While individual actions could be benign, the combination is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious command-line arguments indicating file downloads from external sources and temporary script creation\/deletion, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several powershell.exe processes. The command lines show that they're downloading files from GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory and other paths like Downloads. Downloading files isn't inherently bad, but the fact that multiple files are being downloaded from different branches of various repositories might be a red flag. It could indicate that someone is trying to gather information or possibly deploying something malicious.\n\nThen, there's an instance where chrome.exe is modifying the registry five times. While Chrome does make registry changes during normal operation, multiple such events in quick succession without a clear purpose might suggest tampering or persistence mechanisms being set up by malware.\n\nI also notice that conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are involved in some activities. Conhost.exe is often used by PowerShell to host console windows, so its presence isn't unusual on its own. However, combined with the other events, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nThere's a process named MpDefenderCoreService.exe making a network connection. That's concerning because if this service is legitimate, it shouldn't need to connect out unless something has compromised it. Malware often uses legitimate services for persistence or communication.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating configuration files could be setting up logging or data collection, which might be part of a larger malicious activity to gather information from the system.\n\nRegistry modifications by various processes like notepad.exe and calc.exe are unusual because these aren't typical processes that modify the registry. This behavior suggests potential tampering or backdoor installations.\n\nOverall, while some events on their own might seem normal, the combination of multiple powershell downloads, chrome registry changes, unexpected network activity from defender services, and registry modifications by non-standard processes creates a concerning pattern. These activities could indicate a coordinated attack, data exfiltration, or installation of malware with persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub repositories, along with unusual registry modifications and network activity by MpDefenderCoreService.exe, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are a few entries where the process is svchost.exe and the task is setting registry values. I know that svchost can be tricky because it's often used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. However, without more context, these alone might not raise red flags, especially since they're just setting registry values.\n\nNext, there are powershell.exe processes being accessed and created multiple times. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for both good and bad. Malware often uses it to execute scripts, so repeated accesses could be suspicious. But sometimes admins use PowerShell regularly, too, so it's not definitive on its own.\n\nThen I see whoami.exe being run a couple of times. Whoami is usually benign; it's used to get user information. Unless there's something unusual about how it's called or combined with other actions, this might not be concerning.\n\nLooking further down, there are cmd.exe commands deleting specific registry entries under HKCU\\Run. The command lines show that they're removing entries like \"modulo_temporario\" and \"pacote_auxiliar\". This caught my attention because attackers often clean up their tracks by removing entries from the Run key to avoid detection on restart. Deleting these could be part of persistence mechanisms, which is a red flag.\n\nAlso, there's schtasks.exe being used with Delete commands for a task named \"spawn\". Task Scheduler tasks can be used maliciously to maintain persistence or schedule attacks. The fact that it's deleting an existing task might indicate someone trying to remove evidence or disable a scheduled malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is the use of reg.exe to delete registry entries, which further supports the idea of cleaning up traces. Combined with the cmd.exe deletions, this strengthens the suspicion.\n\nThe process names like conhost.exe and svchost.exe are also common for various legitimate processes, so I'm not sure about those on their own. But when combined with other events, it adds to the picture.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of deleting registry entries related to persistence mechanisms, using schtasks to delete tasks, and multiple powershell accesses. These activities suggest possible malicious behavior aimed at evading detection or ensuring persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including repeated PowerShell accesses, deletion of registry entries related to persistence mechanisms, and removal of scheduled tasks.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. So, the user has provided a bunch of system events related to PowerShell and other processes, and they want me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst off, I notice multiple entries involving powershell.exe. That's a common tool for both admins and attackers, so it's definitely something to keep an eye on. Let's look at the tasks associated with these events.\n\nThere are several \"Process Create\" events for PowerShell. That makes sense if someone is running scripts or commands. But I also see multiple \"Registry value set\" and \"Image loaded\" tasks. Registry changes can be tricky—good for persistence but not always malicious. The image loads seem normal since PowerShell might load various DLLs.\n\nAnother point of interest is the file operations. There's a file being created and then deleted in quick succession: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1\". Creating and deleting files, especially with a temporary name like this, could be part of script testing or maybe an attempt to avoid detection by removing evidence.\n\nThen there's the \"Pipe Created\" event. PowerShell often uses pipes for communication, but sometimes attackers use named pipes for lateral movement. This could indicate some level of concern, though it's not definitive.\n\nLooking at other processes, I see conhost.exe and whoami.exe being executed. Conhost is usually benign, used by PowerShell to host console applications. Whoami.exe is a common tool, often used innocuously or as part of recon scripts. However, seeing these alongside powershell.exe might raise flags if the context suggests they shouldn't be running together.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple process creations, registry modifications, file handling, and pipes. These activities, especially the quick file creation\/deletion and pipe creation, could indicate script execution or potentially malicious behavior. While each event on its own isn't alarming, the combination raises suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe with task types such as Process Create, Registry value set, and File operations. Additionally, there is a file creation followed by deletion of a temporary PowerShell script, which could indicate suspicious activity or testing of script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple instances where cmd.exe is used with tasks like setting registry values. That's not unusual on its own since cmd is a standard tool, but the repeated RegistryEvent task might be something to look into.\n\nThen there are several entries from conhost.exe and powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values. PowerShell is often used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be a red flag because it's commonly exploited by attackers. The multiple ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe could indicate some form of process injection or privilege escalation, which might be malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are ImageLoad events in PowerShell, which make sense if scripts are being executed, but the exact paths should be checked to ensure they're legitimate. The creation and deletion of a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1 is interesting. Temporary files created by scripts can be part of normal operations, but the naming suggests it's testing script policy, which might relate to script execution policies in PowerShell. If this file was created and deleted quickly, it could be an attempt to bypass certain security measures.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events from powershell.exe are a bit confusing. I'm not sure what exactly triggers these, but they seem persistent. Also, the pipe creation events might indicate communication between processes, which can be normal or part of a malicious activity like command and control channels.\n\nThere's an entry for ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe also setting registry values. These are standard system applications, so their involvement in such tasks doesn't immediately raise red flags unless they're being used out of context.\n\nPutting it all together, the consistent use of PowerShell with multiple access events, combined with the temporary file creation\/deletion and pipe creations, makes me suspicious. It seems like there's a pattern that could indicate malicious activity or at least unauthorized system changes. However, without more context on what these scripts are doing, I'm not entirely certain if they're harmful. But considering the volume of unusual activities related to PowerShell, it definitely warrants closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values, along with the creation and deletion of a temporary script file, suggest potential malicious activity or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's see... The logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate event.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve 'chrome.exe' setting registry values. That seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the Windows Registry for settings and extensions. But then I notice there are several events where 'powershell.exe' is involved. PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious, so that catches my attention.\n\nOne event shows powershell.exe being executed with a command line argument: \"& {}\" which doesn't look very meaningful on its own, but maybe it's part of a script. Then there are file creation and deletion events involving temporary files like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1\". The fact that a file is created and then deleted quickly might indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies or clean up evidence.\n\nThere's also a process access event for whoami.exe, which is often used to check user permissions. That could be part of reconnaissance activity. Additionally, powershell.exe accessing various .NET framework DLLs (mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, clrjit.dll) might not be suspicious on their own, but combined with other actions, it raises questions.\n\nI'm concerned about the combination of registry modifications and file operations in the temp directory, especially since these are coming from PowerShell. These could be indicators of malicious activity such as creating a dropper or downloader that's trying to remain undetected by deleting its traces.\n\nSo overall, while some events individually might not be alarming, the pattern across multiple processes and files suggests potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell activities with suspicious file operations and registry changes, possibly indicating malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst off, I notice a lot of PowerShell processes being executed with commands that remove files from the TEMP directory. Specifically, commands like Remove-Item are used to delete .zip and .txt files in $env:TEMP. This pattern repeats several times across different events. That makes me think—why would someone want to delete temporary files so frequently? It could be part of a cleanup routine after some malicious activity. Maybe they're trying to remove traces of their actions or exfiltrated data.\n\nThen there are the Chrome.exe processes with registry changes and loading various DLLs. While these might seem normal, I should consider if any of these DLLs are known malware components. The paths like MpOAV.dll sound suspicious because they mimic legitimate Windows Defender files but could be malicious. Also, multiple registry modifications by Chrome could indicate something's off.\n\nLooking at the other processes: conhost.exe and whoami.exe are being executed. Whoami is typically used to get user information, which might be part of lateral movement or credential dumping. Conhost.exe is often involved in command-line tools, sometimes used maliciously for persistence.\n\nThere are also instances where PowerShell creates files and accesses registry keys. This could be an attempt to establish persistence mechanisms or gather system information. The repeated use of powershell.exe with various arguments makes me more cautious—attackers often use legitimate tools for malicious purposes because they're less likely to be detected.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of file deletions in TEMP, suspicious DLL loads, registry manipulations, and the use of command-line tools like whoami.exe raises red flags. These activities could be indicative of a cyber-attack where an adversary is attempting to cover their tracks or deploy malicious payloads.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell removing files from TEMP, suspicious file deletions, and the use of command-line tools like whoami.exe indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is loading images like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. These are legitimate .NET framework components, so that doesn't seem suspicious on their own. But then there's a file creation and deletion in the TEMP directory for a PowerShell script policy test file. That could be part of normal operations or testing.\n\nNext, I notice several events where powershell.exe is executing Remove-Item commands to delete files in the TEMP directory. These are specific files with names like \"registro_comum.txt\" and others. Deleting temporary files isn't unusual, but the fact that it's done via PowerShell might raise an eyebrow if not expected behavior.\n\nLooking further, there are events where powershell.exe is accessing processes and registry values. The process access event doesn't provide specifics, so I can't tell if it's malicious. Registry writes by both PowerShell and Chrome don't immediately indicate issues, but repeated writes without context could be concerning.\n\nThen there's the whoami.exe execution. This is commonly used for legitimate purposes like checking user information, so it alone isn't suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nI also see that some events involve creating files in various locations, including the Downloads folder and StartupProfileData. These could be part of normal script execution or something more nefarious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell commands deleting specific temp files, accessing processes, writing to the registry, and file creation\/deletion patterns could indicate malicious activity like persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration, or system changes. The batch shows a series of actions that might be part of an attack chain. While some activities are benign, the combination raises red flags.\n\nTherefore, this batch is interesting because it combines several potentially malicious activities that together suggest possible unauthorized access or attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands deleting specific files in the TEMP directory and accessing processes\/registry could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The output should be just one classification, either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, let me look at each event one by one. \n\nThe first few lines are all about 'chrome.exe' setting registry values. That's pretty common because Chrome often tweaks the Windows Registry for updates or settings changes. Then there's an event from 'RuntimeBroker.exe' doing the same thing—another regular activity since Runtime Broker is a legitimate Windows process handling runtime events.\n\nNext, I see several entries from 'powershell.exe' with tasks labeled as 'Process accessed'. Powershell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so accessing processes could be normal or suspicious. But without more context on what the script is doing, it's hard to say. However, these are just process access events, which can happen during legitimate operations.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed with command lines pointing to its system32 path. Whoami is a standard tool for users or scripts to check their permissions and identity. Running this by itself isn't malicious, though it's often used in scripts to gather info which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking further, I notice 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is an agent that collects logs, so this seems normal—maybe just updating its configuration or backing up files. The other FileCreate event from Powershell creates a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt', which translates to something like 'active package' in Portuguese. Without knowing the contents or context of this file, it's hard to judge. However, the filename isn't obviously malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, I don't see any clear signs of malicious activity. Most events are standard processes performing their usual tasks—browsing activities with Chrome, legitimate system process interactions, Powershell accesses that could be part of administration or automated scripts, and log collection tools doing their job. \n\nThe only slightly concerning point is the use of Powershell accessing processes multiple times, but without additional indicators like unusual commands or file creations, it's not enough to raise a red flag. Similarly, whoami.exe being run isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nTherefore, considering all these events collectively, they don't present a clear pattern of malicious behavior. The activities are within the realm of normal system operations and common user actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly routine system activities such as registry updates by Chrome and RuntimeBroker, legitimate Powershell process accesses, and standard whoami.exe executions. The FileCreate events do not indicate malicious behavior without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
