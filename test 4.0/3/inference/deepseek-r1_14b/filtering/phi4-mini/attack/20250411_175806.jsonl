{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the events are all related to process creations and registry modifications. The processes involved include powershell.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe, conhost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and others. There are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessed or creates files, which could be a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement.\n\nLooking at the commands:\n\n1. **powershell.exe** is accessed several times. Accessing this without legitimate cause might indicate malicious activity, especially if combined with other actions like registry modifications.\n2. **cmd.exe** was used to execute a command that adds an entry to the Run key in the Registry: `REG ADD \"HKCU\\...\\Run\" \/V \"registro_auxiliar\" \/D \"C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe\"`. This is suspicious because adding entries to the Run key can allow persistence, meaning the malicious file could run on each user logon.\n3. **reg.exe** was used similarly to add another entry: `REG ADD \"HKCU\\...\\Run\" \/V \"entrada_principal\" \/D \"C:\\Path\\pacote_temporario.exe\"`. Again, this is a common tactic for persistence mechanisms.\n4. **conhost.exe** modified the Registry as well. Conhost is often used by attackers to host payloads or establish communication channels.\n\nThere are also events where files were created by powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe. The file paths like `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\modulo_padrao.txt` and `.winlogbeat.yml.new` might be normal if winlogbeat is a legitimate tool, but the presence of multiple PowerShell accesses alongside these could indicate suspicious activity.\n\nThe combination of using PowerShell, cmd.exe, and reg.exe to modify system configurations (like adding entries to the Run key) suggests potential malicious behavior. These actions are often part of an attack chain, such as initial access, lateral movement, or persistence. The fact that several processes are accessing the Registry and creating files in a user's Downloads directory adds to the suspicion.\n\nI'm confident enough based on these observations to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious process creations (e.g., powershell.exe, cmd.exe) and registry modifications indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
