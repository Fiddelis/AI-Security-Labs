Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is a Process Create for whoami.exe. That's a standard system command, usually not suspicious on its own. It just tells you who the user is.\n\nNext, there are several entries related to powershell.exe. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to look closer. The first mention of powershell.exe is under Process Access, which might mean it's interacting with something else. Then there's a Registry value set, which could indicate configuration changes—maybe installing or updating something, but also potentially setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the events, I see that powershell.exe is executing a script from a path like \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The presence of \"..\" suggests they're navigating directories, which isn't inherently bad but could be part of accessing files in unexpected locations. The script name seems generic, but it's worth noting.\n\nThere are multiple Image Load events for powershell.exe, loading various DLLs and framework components. This is normal when running scripts that require certain libraries, so not a red flag yet.\n\nThen there's an event where a Pipe Created by powershell.exe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which could be legitimate or part of malicious activity like creating a backdoor.\n\nLooking at the other processes: RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe are both common Windows processes. However, seeing Registry value sets and file creations from these might warrant closer inspection. Svchost.exe is often used by legitimate services, but sometimes malware can inject into it.\n\nThe events where svchost.exe creates files in \"C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\\" seem odd. SoftwareDistribution is typically related to Windows Update, so seeing new files being created there could indicate an update or patching process. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is normal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple powershell.exe instances with some potentially suspicious activities like script execution and registry changes, plus pipe creation which might be for communication. The svchost.exe creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory is also concerning as it's not a usual location for file writes unless an update is happening. Combining these factors increases the suspicion level.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because of the powershell activity and the unusual file creation, but I'm not entirely sure if each event alone is malicious or just part of legitimate operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe with suspicious activities including script execution, registry modifications, and pipe creation. Additionally, svchost.exe creates files in an unusual location (Windows\\\\SoftwareDistribution\\\\Download), which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. So, I'm seeing several JSON objects here, each representing an event. The main fields are process, winlog (which describes the task), and file.\n\nFirst off, I notice that many of these events involve 'svchost.exe' as the process name. Svchost is a common Windows process used by services, so it's not inherently suspicious. However, multiple instances where svchost.exe creates files or modifies registry values might be worth looking into because it could indicate some activity by a service that's behaving abnormally.\n\nLooking closer, there are several file creation events from svchost.exe in the path 'C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\...' and other locations. The filenames like wcp.dll, TurboStack.dll, and fvereseal.dll don't ring any immediate bells as malicious, but they could be part of legitimate Windows updates or patches. However, multiple file creations from svchost.exe in a short period might still be notable.\n\nI also see some events involving 'MsedgeWebview2.exe' loading BitsProxy.dll and 'MpSigStub.exe' interacting with various files and registry entries. MpSigStub is related to Windows Defender's signature updates, so that seems normal unless there are unusual patterns. The file paths for these processes don't look suspicious at first glance.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the creation of multiple temporary files in different locations by MpSigStub.exe and setup.exe. Temporary files are common during installations or updates, but if they're being created频繁ly or in unexpected volumes, it might be worth investigating.\n\nWhile none of these individual events seem outright malicious, the combination could raise flags. For example, svchost.exe performing multiple file operations and registry changes within a short timeframe might indicate some form of persistence or lateral movement. It's possible that these are part of legitimate system processes, but without more context on whether this activity is typical for the system in question, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of setup.exe creating files in the EdgeCore directory could be related to software updates or installations. Again, not inherently suspicious, but if this happens when no update was expected, it might warrant closer inspection.\n\nIn summary, while each event on its own doesn't suggest malicious activity, the volume and combination of process activities, especially from svchost.exe, might merit further investigation to ensure there's no underlying issue or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of log events is deemed **interesting but not conclusive as suspicious**. While individual events appear legitimate, the frequency and combination of activities by 'svchost.exe' in particular warrant attention for potential anomalies or unauthorized processes. Further investigation is recommended to assess whether these activities align with normal system behavior.\n\n**Classification:** Not Suspicious\n\n**Confidence Level:** 70% (Low-Medium)"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if the entire set is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an event where MsMpEng.exe loaded mpengine.dll. That seems normal because that's part of Windows Defender. Then, setup.exe created a file in the EdgeCore folder—that also looks legitimate.\n\nNext, whoami.exe was run without any arguments. No issues here; it's just checking user info. Powershell.exe accessed itself and then later had some command line activity with a script. The command line has some PowerShell code that creates a service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to an exe file in C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum... That path seems suspicious because it's using backslashes and might indicate a custom or possibly malicious location.\n\nAnother event shows Powershell.exe accessing mscoree.dll, which is part of the .NET framework, so that's expected. Then there are multiple ImageLoad events for different DLLs related to .NET and Defender. The file delete event in Temp directory is concerning because it deletes a PowerShell script—maybe trying to remove evidence or clean up after executing something.\n\nThere are Pipe Created events, which can be normal but sometimes used by malware for communication. Another ImageLoad of mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll again seems normal. Then tarefa_logico.exe loaded some DLLs—it's named \"task logic\", not sure if that's legitimate, especially since it's loading .NET components.\n\nTwo events show execution of a remote command in the same path as before. The last two events have Powershell running scripts from C:\\unidade_logico\\... and trying to import modules from those locations. This is a red flag because custom scripts can be malicious, and having them execute with try-catch blocks might indicate obfuscation or attempts to handle errors.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts from non-standard paths, creating services, deleting files in Temp, and repeated access to the same script locations. These actions could be indicators of malicious activity like installing a backdoor service or dropping files that shouldn't be there.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including PowerShell executing scripts from non-standard paths, creating services, and file deletions in Temp directory.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. The first few entries are PowerShell commands that import a script and try to run some functions. The paths in the command line look a bit suspicious with all the backslashes and module imports. Then there are multiple attempts to create a new service using New-Service and starting it. That's concerning because creating services can be a way to persist malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the file events, several entries show that 'Execute a Remote Command' is being performed on a specific PowerShell script path. This repetition makes me think it's part of a larger campaign. The fact that the same script is being executed multiple times suggests an attempt to run malicious code consistently.\n\nThe process events are all using PowerShell, which is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities. The use of Invoke-entrada_principal and creating services with specific names could be indicators of potentially harmful scripts trying to establish persistence on the system.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of repeated attempts to execute the same script and create services. This combination raises flags about possible unauthorized access or malware activity aiming for persistence. So, I'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated attempts to execute a PowerShell script and create services, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I've got a batch of system log events in JSONL format that I need to analyze as a whole. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at each event, they all seem similar but with slight variations. Let's break it down one by one.\n\nThe first few lines have \"process\":\"None\", which probably means no associated process was detected. Then there's \"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Execute a Remote Command'}\" indicating that the task involved executing a remote command. The file path is pointing to some script: \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". This looks like a PowerShell script, which is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nI notice that this pattern repeats multiple times—each line has the same structure but the exact same file path. So, it's not just one occurrence; there are many instances of executing the same remote command on the same script. That repetition could be a red flag because attackers might run scripts multiple times or in different contexts to avoid detection.\n\nThen, there are two events where \"process\":\"{'name': 'services.exe'}\" and \"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Logon'}\", followed by another with \"Special Logon\". Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, often associated with services management. The logon tasks could be part of the system's normal operation or an attacker trying to gain access.\n\nPutting this together: multiple attempts to execute a remote command on the same PowerShell script might indicate malicious activity. The repetition suggests persistence or testing, which is common in attacks. However, without more context like timestamps or additional events (e.g., failed logins, unusual network traffic), it's hard to be certain. But considering the frequency and identical file paths, there's a reasonable chance this batch deserves closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of executing remote commands on the same PowerShell script may indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of 18 JSONL events to analyze. My task is to determine if this entire batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". The classification should be based on the combination of all these events.\n\nLooking at each event, I notice that most of them have similar structures. They all seem to come from Windows logs since the key 'winlog' is present in each. Let's break down what each field represents:\n\n1. **Process**: Almost every event has \"None\" for the process field. This suggests that there might be no associated process information captured, or perhaps it wasn't logged.\n\n2. **Winlog Task**: The majority of events (the first 16) have the task as 'Execute a Remote Command'. This indicates some kind of remote command execution is happening. The next event has 'Windows Update Agent', which is slightly different but still related to system updates or background tasks.\n\n3. **File Path**: In most cases, there's a file path provided under 'file' pointing to 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. This seems to be the same script across multiple events. The last event doesn't have a file path.\n\nNow, I need to consider if these activities are normal or could indicate malicious behavior. Remote command execution can be legitimate, especially in environments where scripts or remote commands are part of standard operations. However, repeated executions of the same script might warrant attention.\n\nThe fact that all the events except two are identical is a red flag. Repetitive attempts to execute the same remote command could be a sign of scripting or automation gone wrong, or it could indicate an attempt to flood logs with malicious activity. Since this is over 16 times, it's more than just occasional use.\n\nAnother point is that one event mentions 'Windows Update Agent', which is legitimate for system updates. But the others are all about executing commands. The file path points to a .ps1 script, which is commonly used in Windows environments for automation and scripting but can also be malicious if it's part of an attack chain.\n\nI should consider the confidence level here. While there isn't a direct indication of malicious activity (like known malicious file hashes or unusual behavior), the sheer number of repeated remote command executions does raise suspicions. It could indicate testing, legitimate script runs, or potential unauthorized access attempts.\n\nGiven that all these events are within the same timeframe and involve the same script, it's worth investigating to ensure there's no underlying issue like a compromised system or unintended script execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated remote command executions of the same script suggest potential investigation value.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
