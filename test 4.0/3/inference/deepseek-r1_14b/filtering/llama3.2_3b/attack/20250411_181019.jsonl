Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the first event involves cmd.exe running a command that creates a service called win32times using sc create. The command line looks suspicious because it's trying to execute a PowerShell script from a path with \"NonExistingScript.ps1\". This is a red flag because executing scripts from non-existent paths often indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity or test if the script exists.\n\nThe second event shows powershell.exe being accessed, which in itself isn't suspicious, but combined with other events involving cmd and sc.exe, it raises concerns. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so context matters here.\n\nNext, there's another cmd.exe (through sc.exe) creating a service with a similar command line as the first event, again pointing to the same NonExistingScript.ps1 path. This repetition suggests an attempt to create or modify services, which could be part of a persistence mechanism or service creation for malicious purposes.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple entries where services.exe is involved in setting registry values (RegistryEvent). Services.exe is legitimate, but when it's creating or modifying registry keys, especially under certain keys like HKLM\\...\\Services, it can indicate service-related changes. The multiple RegistryEvent tasks might be part of setting up these services correctly.\n\nThen, there's another sc.exe event querying the win32times service (sc qc). This could be normal administration, but when combined with the creation of the same service earlier, it might suggest an attempt to ensure the service is running or to hide its presence.\n\nThe seventh and eighth events are about calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. While both processes are standard, loading a specific DLL that's often involved in URL handling could be part of legitimate operations but sometimes used by malware for certain functionalities. However, seeing this here doesn't immediately raise red flags unless there's more context.\n\nThe ninth event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an Elasticsearch tool for collecting logs, so it's likely benign unless misused. The new configuration file being created might be part of its setup process.\n\nMoving on, another powershell.exe event setting registry values (RegistryEvent). This adds to the suspicion since PowerShell is often used in attacks for such activities.\n\nThe remaining events are about chrome.exe accessing different parts. Some create pipes and set registry values, others load DLLs. These seem normal unless there's evidence of malicious scripts or extensions being loaded through Chrome, which isn't indicated here.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows a series of process creations and modifications, especially around service creation attempts pointing to non-existing scripts, multiple RegistryEvent tasks, and the use of cmd.exe and sc.exe. These actions could be part of a sophisticated attack where an adversary is trying to establish persistence or deploy malware by creating malicious services.\n\nThe repetition in commands and the target paths (like NonExistingScript.ps1) suggest potential failed attempts or testing phases. Malicious actors often test their payloads incrementally, checking if certain steps work before full deployment. The involvement of both cmd.exe and powershell.exe further indicates a possible multi-step attack chain typical of advanced persistent threats.\n\nWhile there's no direct evidence of malicious code execution (like actual script paths existing), the patterns here are concerning enough to warrant investigation. The confidence is high because the combination of events points towards potential malicious activity, even if individual events aren't overtly suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple process creations and registry modifications involving cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and sc.exe.
