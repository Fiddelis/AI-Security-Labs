{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. I'm given a batch of system events in JSONL format and need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The goal is to classify the entire batch as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING,\" provide a concise justification, and assign a confidence score between 0 and 1.\n\nFirst, I'll review each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first event:\n- Process: cmd.exe with a command line that runs schtasks to create a task. The command includes creating a scheduled task that runs a PowerShell script. Notably, the script path points to \"c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1,\" which doesn't seem valid. Also, using -ep bypass suggests trying to bypass execution policies, often used in malicious scripts.\n\nSecond event:\n- schtasks.exe is used again to create another scheduled task with a similar command structure and an invalid script path (\"c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1\"). Again, this might indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code.\n\nThird event:\n- schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is legitimate for scheduling tasks. This alone isn't suspicious unless combined with other events.\n\nFourth event:\n- Another schtasks.exe process creating a task named win32times. The command line here seems similar but without the malicious script part, so it's hard to tell if this is related or just normal usage.\n\nFifth event:\n- Same as the third; schtasks loading taskschd.dll. No red flags.\n\nSixth event:\n- cmd.exe modifying the registry via a set value. Without knowing exactly what registry key was changed, it's hard to say, but changes here can be malicious if they're persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\nSeventh and twelfth events:\n- winlogbeat.exe creating files in its directory. This is likely from an ELK stack component collecting logs, so not suspicious unless misconfigured.\n\nEighth event:\n- powershell.exe creating a file called \"estrutura_geral.txt.\" Again, the script path here seems non-existent or temporary, possibly related to earlier command executions.\n\nNinth, tenth, and eleventh events:\n- chrome.exe modifying registry values. Browsers often write to the registry for settings, so unless these changes are out of the ordinary, they're not concerning.\n\nThirteenth event:\n- whoami.exe being executed without arguments. This is a common tool used by attackers to check permissions or system info, but in isolation, it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nNow, considering all events together:\n\nThe batch shows multiple instances where schtasks.exe and cmd.exe are being used to create scheduled tasks with embedded PowerShell commands pointing to non-existing scripts. The use of -ep bypass is a red flag for potential script execution attempts. Additionally, the repeated creation of tasks named win32times might be an attempt to establish persistence on the system.\n\nThe cmd.exe registry modification could be part of setting up persistence or changing system configurations. The powershell.exe creating files and whoami.exe execution add to the suspicion, as they are often used in attack chains for information gathering or lateral movement.\n\nHowever, there's also a lot of legitimate activity, like ELK components writing logs and browser modifications. But given the frequency of potentially malicious activities related to task scheduling and PowerShell usage, it seems unusual enough to warrant investigation.\n\nI'm confident at around 0.85 that this batch is interesting because several events point towards possible malicious behavior, though not all are conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including attempts to execute PowerShell scripts with bypass flags and repeated use of schtasks.exe to create scheduled tasks. These actions may indicate potential malicious behavior or unauthorized system modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
