{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is a process named 'powershell.exe' with a task related to the Registry value being set. PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting, but it can also be malicious, so that's something to note. The next few events show cmd.exe running commands like adding users and groups, which could be part of system administration tasks but might also indicate privilege escalation if done improperly.\n\nThere are multiple entries where different executables like net.exe, net1.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe, and others are creating user accounts or modifying security groups. These activities alone aren't necessarily suspicious unless they're done without proper authorization or in an unusual pattern.\n\nI notice several events with 'Registry value set' tasks across various processes. This could be part of legitimate configuration changes, but it's also a common tactic for malware to modify system settings. The use of multiple commands and different tools might indicate someone trying to cover their tracks by using various methods to add users or groups.\n\nLooking further, some events show image loads into processes like svchost.exe and OneDrive.exe, which are known legitimate processes but can be used maliciously if they load unauthorized modules. However, without more context on what's being loaded, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nThere's also an event from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the user's directory. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log management, so unless it's being misused, that doesn't seem concerning.\n\nConsidering all these events together, I'm leaning towards them being potentially malicious because of the repetitive and varied attempts to modify system accounts and registry settings using different tools. The combination of multiple account creations, group modifications, and registry changes with various processes could indicate an attacker trying to establish persistence or elevate privileges. While each individual event might not be suspicious on its own, the bulk of these activities together raise red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of user account additions and registry modifications across various processes suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. There are several instances where Chrome.exe is setting registry values multiple times and also loading some system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These could be normal operations, but the repetition might indicate something suspicious. Additionally, there's a file creation by winlogbeat.exe which is likely part of log management, so probably not an issue. The powershell.exe creating a file named 'componente_secundario.txt' catches my eye tooâ€”powershell can be used for both legitimate and malicious tasks, but without more context on what this file contains, it's hard to say. Overall, the repeated registry changes by Chrome are concerning as they might indicate persistence mechanisms or tampering. The confidence is moderate because while these actions could be part of a campaign, they aren't overtly malicious without further evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry value modifications by chrome.exe and powershell.exe creating files may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
