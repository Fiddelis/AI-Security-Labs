{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of events involving powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first event shows that a file was created: 'objeto_temporario.txt'. The word \"temporario\" means temporary in Portuguese, so maybe this is part of some script activity.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. Registry modifications can be indicators of malicious behavior because attackers often tweak system settings to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe process running, which isn't inherently bad but could be used by attackers to gather information about the system. More concerning is that there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines referencing .ps1 scripts. The script names include \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\", which sounds like it's meant to capture keystrokes—something a keylogger would do, and that's definitely malicious.\n\nAlso, the events show several ImageLoad tasks for different DLLs related to .NET Framework. While these are legitimate system files, the fact that they're being loaded by powershell.exe in this context could be part of loading malicious modules or obfuscating the attack.\n\nI notice a few events where chrome.exe is setting registry values multiple times. This might not be suspicious on its own, but when combined with other activities, it adds to the overall picture. However, the main focus should be on the powershell.exe and whoami.exe events since they indicate potentially harmful actions.\n\nThe repeated RegistryEvent tasks could be an attempt to modify system settings for persistence or privilege escalation. Additionally, the command lines in some events show that Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is being executed with parameters pointing to temporary log files, which suggests data exfiltration or logging keystrokes without user consent.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of activities involving PowerShell executing scripts that could be malicious, along with system modifications and process creations. This combination is indicative of possible unauthorized access, data theft, or persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activity, including powershell.exe executing scripts with potentially harmful purposes (e.g., Get-Keystrokes.ps1), repeated registry modifications, and process creations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is executing scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with varying paths. This script name sounds suspicious because \"Get-Keystrokes\" implies it's capturing keyboard input, which could be malicious activity like keylogging to steal sensitive information.\n\nNext, I notice that the same script path variations are appearing in different events. Each time, the command line shows a different directory structure leading to Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This repetition might indicate an attempt to execute the same malicious script from multiple locations or attempts. It's concerning because it could mean persistence across different files or directories.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and process names, most of these events are occurring within a short timeframe, suggesting multiple activities related to PowerShell execution. The fact that each event shows a slightly different path but the same outcome (running Get-Keystrokes.ps1) makes me think this isn't just a one-off incident but possibly part of a campaign.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is being created and then deleted by PowerShell, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1. This seems like it could be related to script injection or testing permissions. Temporary files created and deleted quickly might be used to bypass certain security policies, making this behavior worth investigating.\n\nAnother point is the involvement of other processes like conhost.exe and svchost.exe performing registry operations and file creations. While these are legitimate system processes, their activity alongside PowerShell's could indicate a broader attack vector or lateral movement within the network. For instance, svchost.exe is often used by malware to hide malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where files related to Windows Defender Platform are loaded by powershell.exe. This might be an attempt to disguise malicious activities under legitimate processes, which is a common tactic in cyberattacks.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple signs of potential malicious activity: repeated execution of a suspicious script, temporary file creation\/deletion, and use of legitimate processes for hiding. These factors increase my confidence that this batch is indeed interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with varying paths suggest potential malicious activity such as keylogging. Temporary file creation and deletion by PowerShell adds suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and then see how they might connect.\n\nFirst, the first event shows that svchost.exe created a file at 'C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\State\\keyValueLKG.dat'. Svchost.exe is a common system process, often associated with services like Windows Update. I know it's not inherently malicious, but sometimes malware can masquerade as it. The file path seems normal for such a process, so this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, the second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file in 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\...'. Winlogbeat is likely an installation or setup file, maybe part of a log management tool. The path points to user downloads, which makes sense if it's being set up there. No red flags here.\n\nThe third event has powershell.exe creating a file in 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_padrao.txt'. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so this catches my eye. However, the path seems like a user download or script placement. If it's part of an automated process or user activity, it might not be bad. But I'm more cautious here because powershell can execute scripts.\n\nLooking at all three together: svchost is normal, winlogbeat setup makes sense, and powershell with a file in downloads—could that be related? Maybe the powershell script is part of a legitimate process or could it be setting up something malicious. But without more context on user behavior or known bad indicators, it's hard to say.\n\nI'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING because each event individually doesn't show clear signs of malicious activity. The combination isn't strong enough to indicate an attack. My confidence is around 0.7 since while nothing stands out, the powershell part does require monitoring.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes creating files in expected locations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
