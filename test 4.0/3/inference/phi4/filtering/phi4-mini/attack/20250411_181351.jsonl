Additionally, the image load event involving `MpOAV.dll` from a specific directory could indicate attempts to manipulate Windows Defender components, raising concerns about potential threats. The combination of these events justifies further investigation into the system's integrity and security posture. The confidence level is set at 0.8 due to the presence of multiple concerning indicators, though some ambiguity remains without additional context or data."}
