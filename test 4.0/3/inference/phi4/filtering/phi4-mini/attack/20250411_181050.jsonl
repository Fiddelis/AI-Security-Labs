Additionally, there are instances of processes like cmd.exe running suspicious command lines involving certutil.exe for encoding\/decoding, which aligns with techniques used in malware distribution. The use of SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll multiple times might indicate attempts to manipulate legitimate system DLLs, potentially indicative of an attack. Other indicators include the execution of powershell.exe and cmd.exe alongside registry modifications, common in persistence strategies by attackers.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
