While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process used to host services, it is frequently mimicked by malware to perform malicious actions without raising suspicion. The sheer volume and uniformity of these events suggest a potential misuse that warrants further investigation. However, the confidence level reflects some uncertainty due to possible benign scenarios or misconfigurations that could lead to similar logs."}
