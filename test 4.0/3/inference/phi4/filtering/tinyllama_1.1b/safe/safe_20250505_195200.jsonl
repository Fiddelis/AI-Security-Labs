This executable is commonly associated with legitimate operations related to Microsoft Office Suite's SmartDeploy features for offline content deployment.\n\n2. **Volume of Activity**: There is a high volume of file creation activities (12 unique files) in a short timeframe, which could be unusual and warrant further investigation.\n\n3. **File Paths and Naming Patterns**:\n   - The files are created within `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages`, indicating they might relate to Microsoft Office add-ons or solutions.\n   - Files contain names with a common prefix (`excel-copilot-strings-n-tier`), suggesting these could be part of the same package or related functionality. The presence of multiple files with similar names but different hashes could indicate some level of obfuscation or tampering.\n\n4. **Potential Red Flags**:\n   - The repetitive creation of files with minor variations in their hash values (`dde88a1e`, `df97af4b`, etc.) might suggest automated or scripted behavior, potentially malicious if unauthorized.\n   - While SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, its use for creating multiple files rapidly can sometimes be exploited by malware to deploy scripts or other payloads.\n\n5. **Need for Further Investigation**:\n   - Verification that the activities are part of expected deployments by Microsoft Office features should be conducted.\n   - Checking file contents and digital signatures against known good versions from official sources would help determine if they have been altered maliciously.\n   \nGiven these points, while it's possible this is legitimate behavior associated with a large deployment or update task, the pattern and volume suggest further scrutiny to rule out malicious intent. The confidence level reflects typical characteristics of suspicious activity, balanced by the fact that SDXHelper.exe can be used legitimately in these contexts."}
