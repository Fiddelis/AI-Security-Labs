{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe, a common vector for persistence and malicious configuration changes. Additionally, PowerShell is involved in both setting registry values and creating files, which could indicate script-based attacks or data exfiltration activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Registry Modifications:** The extensive number of `Registry value set` events linked to `chrome.exe` raises concerns about potential misuse for persistence, configuration changes, or malicious behavior.\n  \n- **PowerShell Activity:** The use of `powershell.exe` in both setting registry values and creating files suggests possible script execution, which is a common technique used by attackers for executing payloads or conducting post-exploitation activities.\n\n- **Process Access and Image Load Events:** The `process accessed` event linked to `powershell.exe`, along with image load events associated with system DLLs (like `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll`), could indicate attempts to interact with or bypass security mechanisms, which are often seen in advanced persistent threats (APTs).\n\n- **File Creation Events:** The creation of files via both `winlogbeat.exe` and `powershell.exe` might suggest data collection activities, possibly for exfiltration purposes.\n\nGiven these points, the batch warrants further investigation to determine if malicious activity is indeed present."}
