The file types (e.g., `.d.ts`, which are TypeScript declaration files) suggest they are part of the tooling setup or library management rather than something suspicious.\n\n3. **Process Name**: The process name `git.exe` is legitimate and aligns with standard development practices, particularly when managing code dependencies and configurations.\n\n4. **Lack of Suspicious Indicators**: There are no indicators of unusual behavior such as unexpected file paths, unauthorized processes, or other signs commonly associated with malicious activity.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**: The high confidence level (0.95) is based on the uniformity of events pointing to a normal development scenario without any anomalies that would suggest the need for further investigation."}
