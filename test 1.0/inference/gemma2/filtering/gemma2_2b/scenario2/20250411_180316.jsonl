This is often a sign of attackers leveraging PowerShell's scripting capabilities for malicious actions.\n* **Command Execution:**  `cmd.exe` is used with commands like `copy`, `schtasks`, and `whoami`. These commands can be misused by attackers to execute files, schedule tasks, or gather system information.\n* **Registry Modifications:** Numerous entries indicate `Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)` actions. Attackers frequently modify registry settings to persist malware, alter system behavior, or hide their presence.\n\nThe combination of these events suggests a potential threat and warrants further investigation."}

Analyzing the content of modified registry keys, the commands run by `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`, and the script file itself are essential steps in a thorough security assessment."}

This is a common tactic used by attackers.\n* **Suspicious File Loads:**  `powershell.exe` loads several files, including some located in temporary directories (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp`) which suggests script execution or potential malware download. \n* **Script Execution and Testing:** Events like `\"if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\tarefa_temporario\\\\componente_padrao\\\\entrada_geral\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}\"` indicate the execution of scripts, possibly to check for the existence of other malicious files.\n* **File Creation and Deletion:** Temporary files are created and immediately deleted. This is a common technique used by malware to avoid detection.\n\n**Key Indicators:**\n* The path \"C:\\\\tarefa_temporario\\\\componente_padrao\\\\entrada_geral\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" suggests a potential keylogger script being executed.
