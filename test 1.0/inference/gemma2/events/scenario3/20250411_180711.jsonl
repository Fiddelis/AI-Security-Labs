Deleting files in the TEMP directory often hides malicious actions.\n* **PowerShell Usage:**  Frequent PowerShell executions, especially with custom scripts and file manipulations, are common tactics used by malware for evading detection and performing malicious tasks.\n* **Registry Modifications:**  The `Registry value set` events indicate that PowerShell might be altering system settings, which can be a sign of malware trying to gain persistence or compromise system configurations.\n\n**Overall**: The combination of these actions suggests a possible investigation is warranted. Further analysis of the removed files, script content, and registry changes would be necessary to determine the exact nature of the threat."}
