Specifically, the creation of a service named 'tarefa_principal' with a path in a directory that does not seem to be part of the standard Windows directories ('C:\\\\pacote_auxiliar\\\\registro_base\\\\modulo_ativo\\\\bin\\\\unidade_geral.exe') and multiple instances of services.exe setting registry values suggest potential malicious activity.\"\n}"}
