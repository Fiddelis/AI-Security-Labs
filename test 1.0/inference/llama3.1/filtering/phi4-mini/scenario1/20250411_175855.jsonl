However, upon closer inspection, we notice that certain processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe are accessing the registry and creating files in unusual locations. Additionally, winlogbeat.exe is creating log files with unusual names. While these actions could be indicative of potential malicious behavior, they do not appear to be coordinated or part of a larger attack pattern. Therefore, based on the current analysis, this batch can be considered NOT INTERESTING for further investigation.\"\n}"}
