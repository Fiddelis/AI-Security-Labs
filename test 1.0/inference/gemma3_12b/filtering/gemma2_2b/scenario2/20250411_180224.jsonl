The creation of scheduled tasks with names like 'win32times' and the use of non-existent script names ('objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1', 'entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1') are suspicious indicators. The creation of files in the `C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\Tasks` directory is also concerning, alongside numerous registry modifications and PowerShell executions.\"\n}\n```"}
