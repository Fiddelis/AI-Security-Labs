The use of non-existent script paths (`c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`) within these scheduled tasks further strengthens the suspicion of malicious intent, potentially indicating attempts to obfuscate the true purpose of the scripts. The creation of scheduled tasks referencing 'win32times' is also suspicious.\"\n}\n```"}
