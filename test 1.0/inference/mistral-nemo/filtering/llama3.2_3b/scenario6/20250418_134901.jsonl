This could indicate unwanted or malicious activities, such as browser hijacking or malware installing extensions.\n\n4. **Unknown Process (SDXHelper.exe):**\n   - This process loaded three system DLLs (`combase.dll`, `urlmon.dll`) twice each. Loading multiple system libraries can be a sign of suspicious activity.\n\n5. **Winlogbeat Re-running:**\n   - After SDXHelper's activities, `winlogbeat.exe` was started again and created `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file once more.\n\n**Potential Security Concerns:**\n\n- The repeated registry value sets by Chrome and the unknown process (`SDXHelper.exe`) could indicate unwanted software installation or modification.\n- The unknown process (`SDXHelper.exe`) loading multiple system libraries is unusual and might be a sign of malicious activity.\n- Winlogbeat re-running and creating the `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file again suggests some kind of persistence mechanism that requires further investigation.\n\nTo investigate these concerns, consider reviewing the following:\n\n- Check for any unknown or unwanted software installed on the system.\n- Monitor registry values for unusual changes or additions.\n- Inspect the behavior and origin of `SDXHelper.exe`.\n- Verify if there are any unauthorized modifications to `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file."}
