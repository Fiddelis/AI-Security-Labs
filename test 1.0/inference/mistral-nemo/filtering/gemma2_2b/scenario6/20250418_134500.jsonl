The frequent termination of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` might indicate an issue with the update process, which could warrant further investigation.\n\nHowever, without additional context or potential threats identified by a security tool, these events alone do not necessarily indicate malicious activity. They could be part of regular system and software maintenance."}
