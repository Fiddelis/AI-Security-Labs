{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at all these JSON objects here, each representing an event from system logs. The goal is to analyze them as a whole and decide if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first event shows 'whoami.exe' being executed. That seems pretty normal because it's a common utility used to get user information. Nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, I see multiple events related to 'powershell.exe'. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. So, the presence of several powershell processes caught my attention.\n\nLooking at the command lines in some of these powershell.exe events, I notice a pattern: they're using findstr and select-string with patterns like \"pass\" and searching through various file types such as .xml, .doc, .txt, .xls. This makes me think that someone is trying to search for sensitive information, possibly passwords or credentials. That's definitely a red flag because this kind of activity could be part of data exfiltration or espionage.\n\nAlso, there are events where powershell.exe is setting registry values and loading various images. While powershell can do legitimate things with the registry, the combination of searching for sensitive info makes me suspicious. Additionally, I see that powershell.exe creates a temporary file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1) which it then deletes. This is a common tactic to avoid detection because creating and deleting files quickly can help evade log monitoring.\n\nThere are multiple entries where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle' with the same command line, suggesting repeated attempts or maybe part of a script that's being executed multiple times. This repetition could indicate an automated process trying different things or attempting to bypass certain security measures.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that notepad.exe wrote to the registry. That seems a bit out of place because notepad is typically used for editing text files, not modifying system settings. Could be innocent, but combined with all the powershell activity, it's worth noting.\n\nLastly, calc.exe loaded urlmon.dll, which is a standard Windows DLL. No immediate red flags there, just normal process loading.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple powershell processes executing scripts that search for sensitive data, creating and deleting temporary files, repeated provider lifecycle events—all these points suggest potential malicious activity. The batch as a whole shows behavior that's not typical of everyday user actions and could be indicative of an attack or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is **interesting** because it shows signs of potentially malicious activities involving powershell.exe searching for sensitive information, creating\/deleting temporary files, and repeated provider lifecycle events. These behaviors suggest possible unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious command lines searching for sensitive information, combined with file creation\/deletion patterns, indicate potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving powershell.exe and other processes like findstr.exe. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious activities. The command line in one of the powershell.exe events has \"findstr\" with some search patterns looking for 'pass' in various file types. That seems suspicious because it might indicate a password-hunting script.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where svchost.exe is modifying registry values. SvcHost is a standard Windows process but can be used maliciously to hide activities. The repeated Registry value sets could be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations for malicious purposes.\n\nThere's also an event where Calculator.exe loads urlmon.dll. While Calculator is benign, loading unusual DLLs might suggest some form of injection or unauthorized behavior. However, this might not be too concerning on its own unless combined with other anomalies.\n\nAnother interesting point is the repeated Dns query events from chrome.exe and powershell.exe.频繁的DNS查询可能用于命令和控制通信，这在恶意活动中很常见。此外，winlogbeat.exe创建了一个新文件，可能是配置文件的更新，但看起来是正常的。\n\n综合来看，这个日志批次中存在多个红旗，尤其是powershell和findstr的组合使用，以及svchost和注册表修改。这些活动可能表明正在进行中的恶意行为，如密码收集、 persistence建立或C2通信。因此，这批日志值得进一步调查。\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities, including Powershell command-line activities with potential password-hunting patterns and repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe and other processes. These could indicate malicious behavior or unauthorized system changes.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break them down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from Chrome.exe performing various tasks like image loading and registry changes. These could be normal operations since Chrome often updates or interacts with system components. But I notice some Network connection detections—four in total. While legitimate apps do connect to the internet, too many connections without a clear reason might warrant closer look.\n\nThen there are several FileCreate events from PowerShell.exe creating files in user directories. Creating files isn't inherently malicious, but PowerShell is often used for scripting and can be abused by attackers. The file names like 'objeto_logico.txt' and 'estrutura_ativo.txt' don't raise immediate red flags, but I should consider if these are part of a larger pattern.\n\nI also see FileCreate events from winlogbeat.exe, which is likely related to log management—nothing suspicious there.\n\nThe Process Create events for whoami.exe and cmd.exe with specific command lines stand out. The cmd.exe commands delete scheduled tasks, which could be legitimate admin activity or an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms used by malware. Similarly, schtasks.exe being used to delete tasks might indicate someone trying to clean up traces of malicious activities.\n\nThe RegistryEvent entries from various processes modifying registry values are concerning. Malware often uses the registry for persistence and configuration. The repeated registry modifications without a clear purpose could be signs of tampering.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple process creations, file operations, network connections, and registry changes across different legitimate-looking tools like Chrome, PowerShell, cmd.exe, and schtasks.exe. These activities might be part of normal user behavior, but the frequency and combination suggest possible malicious intent—potentially setting up a backdoor or persistence mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as INTERESTING because it exhibits behaviors that could indicate an ongoing attack or unauthorized system activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activities such as repeated network connections from Chrome.exe, file creations and registry modifications by PowerShell.exe, deletion of scheduled tasks using cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, and registry changes.

{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm given a bunch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to see what's happening. \n\nThe first line has 'schtasks.exe' loading 'taskschd.dll'. That seems normal because schtasks is related to scheduled tasks. Next, 'svchost.exe' is modifying the registry—that's common too since svchost is a legitimate process for services.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of 'cmd.exe', 'powershell.exe', and 'conhost.exe' doing various things. I see commands like deleting processes (notepad.exe), users via net user, etc. Using cmd to delete users sounds suspicious because it's administrative activity that could indicate someone trying to remove accounts, maybe for malicious purposes.\n\nThere are also several entries where powershell.exe is accessing or modifying the registry. Powershell can be used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so repeated actions here might raise flags. The use of wmic.exe to delete processes is another red flag because wmic is often used in command-line attacks to manage processes, which could be part of a remote attack.\n\nLooking further down, I see 'whoami.exe' being executed multiple times. Whoami is usually used to check user permissions or identify the current user. If it's run excessively, especially by unknown processes, it might indicate privilege escalation attempts.\n\nThe batch shows repeated process creations and deletions, especially targeting notepad.exe and various admin users. This could be part of a script trying to clear traces or remove access for certain accounts, which doesn't seem normal on a system unless there's an active attempt to compromise security.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of legitimate tools (cmd, powershell, wmic) being used in ways that could be malicious—deleting processes, users, and registry modifications. The volume and specific actions make me think this batch is indicative of potential unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of legitimate system tools like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and wmic.exe being used to delete processes, users, and modify the registry, which may indicate potential unauthorized access or malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. I'm going through each event one by one and seeing what stands out.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed or used. Powershell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious activities like command execution and persistence. The fact that it's accessed several times might be a red flag, especially if the commands aren't clearly benign.\n\nLooking at specific events, I see commands using cmd.exe with parameters like \"\/c net user\" followed by usernames and deletion flags. This seems suspicious because deleting users from the system could indicate an attempt to remove traces of other accounts or escalate privileges. For example, \"net user modulo_auxiliar_Admin \/del \/domain\" suggests someone is trying to delete a user account across the domain.\n\nThere are also commands like \"\/c sc delete win32times\", which deletes a service. Again, this could be part of an attempt to remove malicious services or legitimate ones, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, repeated deletions might not be normal activity.\n\nAnother point is the use of whoami.exe multiple times. While whoami is generally used to check user permissions and identity, seeing it in several events could indicate someone checking their privileges or trying to gather information about the system.\n\nThe services.exe processes modifying registry entries are also notable. Services often interact with the registry, but changes here can sometimes be part of malicious activities like creating persistence mechanisms or altering service configurations to avoid detection.\n\nThere's a command using del to delete files in the temp directory: \"del %temp%\\\\unidade_temporario_calc.txt\" and another file. This could be an attempt to clean up temporary files, possibly after executing some malicious script. It raises questions about what those files were used for before deletion.\n\nPutting it all together, I notice a pattern of process creations, registry modifications, user deletions, and file deletions involving various legitimate tools. These actions in isolation might not be conclusive, but the combination suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with deletion commands is particularly concerning. It's possible that an attacker is trying to remove evidence or escalate privileges.\n\nTherefore, this batch of events should be classified as interesting because they exhibit signs of potentially unauthorized or malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including user deletions, service removals, and file deletions using tools like cmd.exe and powershell.exe, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me go through this batch of log events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed and accessed. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously to execute scripts or commands. The command lines like 'powershell.exe & {}' are unusual and might indicate attempts to run scripts without proper parameters, which could be suspicious.\n\nThere's also a file deletion event from cmd.exe deleting a specific temp file: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe. This file name seems like it could be related to malicious activity since it has \"calc\" decoded, which is a common payload in malware for creating malicious processes.\n\nAdditionally, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs. While this can be normal, the combination with other suspicious activities might raise concerns about potential lateral movement or加载恶意库。\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there's a mix of process creations, registry modifications, file deletions, and pipe creations. These actions together could indicate an attack chain, such as initial access, credential dumping, or execution of malicious scripts.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe with different command lines suggests attempts to bypass detection or execute multiple stages of an attack. The deletion of a temp file and the creation\/deletion of a PowerShell script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1) might be part of script injection or persistence techniques.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch shows behaviors that could be indicative of malicious activity, making it relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe execution with unusual command lines, file deletions, and registry modifications.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is being used. It's a common tool for admins but also often abused by attackers. The events show things like Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, and Process accessed tasks. These actions alone aren't necessarily malicious, but repeated or unusual use could be suspicious.\n\nI notice that 'whoami.exe' is executed several times with the command line pointing to the system32 directory, which is normal, so maybe not a red flag unless it's used in an unexpected way. But here it just seems like it's being run normally.\n\nThen there are entries for programs like conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, calc.exe, and Calculator.exe. These are typically benign processes. For example, 'calc.exe' is loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL for handling URLs in Windows applications. No issues there.\n\nNotepad.exe and svchost.exe also show up doing registry-related tasks, but again, these are common activities for many legitimate programs. Svchost.exe is known to host various services, so seeing it accessing the registry isn't unusual.\n\nThe events involving winlogbeat.exe creating files in the downloads folder might be from a log monitoring tool. It doesn't seem suspicious unless there's an irregularity in how it's being used, which I don't see here.\n\nOverall, while each event on its own could raise an eyebrow, especially with PowerShell and registry changes, looking at the entire batch together shows a lot of normal activities. There are repeated ProcessAccess events for PowerShell but without any indication of malicious code execution or unusual file creations or network activity. The lack of other red flags like failed logins, deleted files, or known malicious process names makes me lean towards these being legitimate actions.\n\nI think the combination of events doesn't point to a clear attack vector. They look more like routine system operations and tool usage rather than indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists primarily of normal system activities, including legitimate use of PowerShell and other utilities, without evidence of malicious behavior.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That's pretty standard because it's a legitimate system utility used to display user information. No red flags there, as this could just be a user checking their permissions or something similar.\n\nNext up is \"powershell.exe\" being accessed. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for both good and bad purposes. However, the event here only shows it was accessed, not executed with any malicious commands. So unless there's more context about what was done within PowerShell, this alone isn't concerning.\n\nThe third event involves \"ApplicationFrameHost.exe\" setting a registry value. This is part of Windows Shell and often used by applications to integrate into the Start menu or taskbar. It's normal for legitimate software to make such registry changes during installation or configuration.\n\nThen there's \"Calculator.exe\" also setting a registry value. Again, this seems routine. Built-in system tools like Calculator don't usually indicate malicious activity unless they're being used in an unusual way.\n\nMoving on, multiple instances of \"chrome.exe\" are showing various activities: DNS queries and network connections. Browsers naturally perform DNS lookups to navigate websites and establish connections. The repeated DNS queries could be due to a user browsing multiple pages or perhaps some background updates, but nothing malicious here. Similarly, the network connections are typical for any web-surfing activity.\n\nI don't see any events that indicate suspicious behavior like process injection, file access to restricted areas, or changes to critical system configurations. All these activities seem within the bounds of normal user operations and application behaviors.\n\nConsidering all events together, there's no evidence of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. Each event individually doesn't raise a flag, and collectively, they don't suggest any coordinated attack or exploit.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as process creation, registry modifications, and network\/dns queries from common applications like Chrome and Calculator. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\"\n}"}
