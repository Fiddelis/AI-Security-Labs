Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several events where the process is powershell.exe and the command line shows a script trying to create scheduled tasks using Register-ScheduledTask with various names like \"unidade_ativo\" and \"registro_geral\". The task triggers at logon and runs calc.exe. This seems suspicious because creating multiple scheduled tasks with administrative privileges could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThen, there are events where the command line is obfuscated or not present, just showing powershell.exe without details. These might be attempts to hide the actual commands being executed.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, most events are categorized under 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'RegistryEvent', which relate to task creation and registry changes. The fact that multiple tasks are created with similar names suggests a pattern of malicious activity rather than legitimate use.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where chrome.exe creates a pipe and makes registry changes, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is part of the attack or just normal behavior.\n\nI also notice several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .NET framework files. This isn't unusual on its own but could be part of executing malicious scripts that require certain libraries.\n\nConsidering all these together—multiple scheduled tasks created with administrative access, obfuscated command lines, and repeated process activities—it's likely indicative of a potential attack or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges.

{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario5\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. \n\nLooking through the JSONL data, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved. The first event shows that powershell.exe loaded an image (MpOAV.dll), which could be part of normal operations since it's related to Windows Defender. Then there's a file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, which might be suspicious because creating and immediately deleting files can be indicators of malicious activity trying to avoid detection.\n\nNext, there are several events where powershell.exe is executing commands using scheduled tasks. Specifically, the command lines create new scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges. This stands out as potentially malicious because adding a task to run calc.exe upon logon might be a way to maintain persistence or escalate privileges, especially since it's targeting Administrators group and running at highest level.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry writes from chrome.exe, which could be part of legitimate updates but also might indicate something if the changes aren't standard. However, considering that many events here involve powershell.exe with suspicious activities, this is more concerning.\n\nThere's also a series of \"Execute a Remote Command\" entries without any associated process or file information, which is odd. These might be attempts to execute commands over remote sessions, possibly indicating remote control or command and control (C2) activity.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe, deletion of temporary files, and numerous remote command executions suggests potential malicious behavior aimed at persistence and lateral movement within a network. This batch definitely warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including file creation\/deletion in temporary directories and registry modifications. Additionally, there are attempts to execute remote commands and create scheduled tasks that may indicate malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario5\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system events and trying to figure out if they're worth investigating. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an event where WmiPrvSE.exe loaded taskschd.dll. That seems normal because WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation, so it's likely part of legitimate operations.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process, often used by services. The fact that it's modifying the registry isn't suspicious on its own unless there are other indicators.\n\nThen, another event shows svchost creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks. Again, this could be normal as svchost can create or manage task-related files for scheduled tasks.\n\nThere's an entry where no process is listed, but the task is \"Execute a Remote Command.\" That stands out because it indicates some remote execution might be happening, which could be malicious. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe creates a file in a user-specific directory and modifies the registry. Powershell is commonly used by attackers but can also be legitimate. The files created here don't seem immediately suspicious, but I should note that.\n\nConhost.exe and chrome.exe events follow. Conhost is part of Windows and typically not malicious. Chrome accessing system files like amsi.dll or MpOAV.dll for anti-malware scans seems normal. However, multiple registry modifications by chrome might be worth looking into, though it's possible they're just updates.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event creates another file in the user's downloads folder. This could be part of legitimate script execution, but again, without more info, it's hard to judge.\n\nThere are several instances where no process is listed for remote command executions. That raises a red flag because unaccounted remote commands can indicate unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n\nFinally, winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files isn't unusual if that's part of its logging setup, but I should check the file paths to ensure they're legitimate and not trying to hide something.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of multiple remote command executions without a clear process suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell.exe and svchost with registry modifications could be indicators of an attack, like creating persistence mechanisms or dropping malware components.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially suspicious activities such as remote command execution without a process name, repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe and chrome.exe, and file creations in user directories by powershell.exe. These could indicate malicious behavior or unauthorized access.\"\n}\n```"}
