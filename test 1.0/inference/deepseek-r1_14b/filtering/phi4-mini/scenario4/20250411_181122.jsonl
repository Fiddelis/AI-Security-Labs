Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an execution of `whoami.exe`, which is a common system utility used to get user information. That in itself isn't unusual unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nNext, several entries show `powershell.exe` being executed with specific command lines. The command lines involve using `findstr` and `select-string` commands. These are often used for searching text within files, but the fact that they're looking specifically for patterns like \"password\" in various file types (xml, doc, txt, xls) raises a red flag. This behavior is indicative of attempting to search for sensitive information, which could be malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where `powershell.exe` accesses registry values and sets them. These actions can be legitimate but also commonly used by malware to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nI notice that the same PowerShell command line appears repeatedly. This repetition suggests an automated process or a script being executed multiple times, which could be part of a larger attack sequence.\n\nThere are file creation and deletion events related to temporary PowerShell scripts in the user's local temp directory. The script is named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1`. Temporary files created by scripts can be part of normal operations, but deleting them shortly after creation might indicate an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where `powershell.exe` loads various DLLs. While this is standard for PowerShell execution, it's worth noting the specific paths and whether any of these could be related to known malicious activities.\n\nOther processes like `winlogbeat.exe`, `notepad.exe`, `calc.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are also mentioned. These can be benign or potentially used in attacks depending on their context. For example, `svchost.exe` is commonly used by legitimate services but can also host malicious payloads.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell to search for sensitive data, coupled with the creation and deletion of temporary scripts, suggests potential malicious activity such as credential harvesting or data exfiltration. The multiple attempts to execute similar commands could indicate a script trying different approaches to avoid detection or persistence mechanisms being set up.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts, searching for sensitive information, and creating\/deleting temporary files suggest possible malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi4-mini\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst event: svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svchost is a common process, often used by legitimate services but can also be malware. But on its own, it's not enough to suspect anything.\n\nNext, findstr.exe being run with some parameters searching for \"pass\" in various file types. That might look suspicious because why search for passwords like that? Maybe data harvesting?\n\nThen there's a PowerShell command that uses findstr and select-string looking for the word \"password\". This is concerning because PowerShell is often used by attackers for its scripting capabilities. The use of selecting strings related to passwords could indicate credential harvesting.\n\nLooking further, multiple entries show powershell.exe creating files and setting registry values. That's a bit worrying because attackers might be trying to maintain persistence or drop malicious scripts.\n\nConhost.exe and other normal processes like Calculator.exe also setting registry values. These are usually benign but could be part of a larger attack if combined with other activities.\n\nChrome.exe has several events: pipe created, registry changes, loading DLLs, network connections. While Chrome is legitimate, the repeated registry writes might indicate tampering or malicious extension activity. The DNS queries and network connections could be normal browsing or part of an exfiltration.\n\nThere's a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which seems related to log management—probably not malicious unless it's being misused.\n\nAnother PowerShell command creates an object_logico.txt file. The name is in Portuguese, but without context, it's hard to say if it's malicious. It could be part of data collection or something more nefarious.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows multiple signs of potentially malicious activity—suspicious searches with findstr and PowerShell commands targeting password-related information, repeated registry modifications by powershell.exe, and unusual file creations. These activities might indicate an ongoing attack, especially since they involve common tools used in cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activity, such as suspicious process creation (powershell.exe with specific command lines), repeated registry modifications, and file operations that could indicate data harvesting or persistence mechanisms.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi4-mini\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events here, each in JSONL format. Each line represents an event with some process details, a Windows log entry, and possibly a file path.\n\nLooking at the first few entries: Chrome.exe setting registry values. That seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings. So these might just be standard operations.\n\nThen there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely an agent used to collect logs, so it making changes to its config files doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nNext, powershell.exe creates a file named estrutura_ativo.txt. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities. Creating a file could be part of script execution. I should keep an eye on this, but by itself, it might not be suspicious unless the content of the file is known to be malicious.\n\nAnother winlogbeat.exe event doing something similar, so that's probably okay.\n\nThen there are multiple ProcessAccess events from powershell.exe. This indicates that PowerShell is accessing other processes. Depending on what those processes are and how they're being accessed, this could be concerning. If it's part of legitimate script execution, maybe not, but repeated access might warrant closer look.\n\nLooking further, whoami.exe is run without any arguments. That seems straightforward—it's a common tool to check user information. Not inherently malicious unless used as part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThere are several cmd.exe commands deleting scheduled tasks using schtasks. Schtasks is legitimate for managing scheduled tasks, but deleting them could be part of a persistence mechanism in malware trying to remove competition or cover tracks. This might be a red flag because it's unusual for standard operations to delete system tasks unless there's an automated process involved.\n\nAlso, powershell.exe accessing processes multiple times—could this be lateral movement? If the environment is being compromised, attackers often use PowerShell for command and control.\n\nWMIC.exe is used to delete notepad.exe processes. WMIC can execute commands remotely, which makes it a vector for attacks. Using it to delete processes could indicate an attempt to terminate legitimate tools or other malicious activities. This adds more concern because it's another tool with potential misuse.\n\nThere are also ImageLoad events from schtasks.exe and wmic.exe loading system DLLs, which is normal but when combined with other suspicious actions might suggest something more nefarious.\n\nsvchost.exe modifying registry entries multiple times—since svchost is a legitimate process used by services, it's tricky because malicious actors can abuse it. Unusual registry modifications could be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes to avoid detection.\n\nPutting all this together: The batch shows several red flags. There are repeated uses of powershell.exe accessing processes and files, which could be indicators of malicious activity. The use of schtasks.exe and wmic.exe to delete system processes might suggest an attacker trying to remove competition or leave fewer traces. Additionally, the multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe could be part of a persistence routine.\n\nSo, overall, while some events are normal, the combination points towards potential malicious activities that merit investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Multiple Registry Modifications by Chrome.exe and svchost.exe:**\n   - While Chrome interacting with the registry is standard, repeated modifications without a clear purpose could indicate suspicious activity.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat.exe Creating Configuration Files:**\n   - This is expected behavior for log collection agents, so it's likely benign unless unusual file paths or content are present.\n\n3. **PowerShell.exe Creating and Accessing Files\/Folders:**\n   - PowerShell is versatile but often used maliciously. The creation of `estrutura_ativo.txt` without known context could be concerning.\n\n4. **Repetitive ProcessAccess Events from PowerShell.exe:**\n   - Could indicate lateral movement or unauthorized access to other processes, a sign of potential compromise.\n\n5. **Use of Schtasks.exe and Wmic.exe to Delete Processes:**\n   - Deleting system tasks like notepad.exe is unusual and may suggest an attacker attempting to remove competition or cover their tracks.\n\n6. **Registry Modifications by svchost.exe:**\n   - Since svchost can be abused, these changes might be part of a persistence mechanism used by malware.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of events, particularly the misuse of tools like PowerShell, Schtasks, and WMIC, along with suspicious process deletions and registry modifications, indicates potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch of logs is **interesting for investigation** as it exhibits several red flags indicative of a cybersecurity threat."}

Let's see what each event shows.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where powershell.exe is involved, with tasks like Registry value set and Process access. PowerShell can be a red flag because it's often used in scripting and might be abused by attackers. But sometimes it's just legitimate use.\n\nLooking at the command lines, I notice some commands like \"net user \/del\" which are deleting users. That could indicate someone cleaning up traces or removing accounts, possibly to cover their tracks. The usernames being deleted have \"_Admin\" in them, maybe trying to impersonate an admin account.\n\nThere are also instances of cmd.exe and net.exe running delete commands on specific user accounts. This repeated use of command-line tools for user deletion might be part of a larger pattern. Maybe someone is systematically removing accounts across the system.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where whoami.exe was run, which can be used to check permissions or see if they're running as a different user. That could be part of testing access levels.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a sequence of actions aimed at deleting user accounts using various tools. The combination of multiple deletions and the use of administrative commands makes me think this activity might not be normal. It could indicate potential unauthorized access or system compromise.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I would classify this batch as interesting because the repeated account deletions and use of powershell.exe with administrative commands suggest possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple events involving deletion of user accounts using cmd.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe, along with PowerShell activities.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of process creations and activity involving various executables like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, services.exe, conhost.exe, and whoami.exe. Powershell is often used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be abused by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The fact that there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that aren't immediately clear (like \"& {}\") might be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the events, I see several entries where Registry values are being set and files are being deleted. For example, cmd.exe is deleting specific files in the Temp directory, which could indicate an attempt to clean up traces of malicious activity or remove tools used during an attack. The deletion of \"tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe\" might be trying to erase evidence.\n\nAdditionally, there are instances where services.exe interacts with the registry, and whoami.exe is being executed without arguments, which might be used to check user permissions or credentials. The repeated use of these tools could signal someone attempting to escalate privileges or establish persistence.\n\nThe presence of multiple RegistryEvent tasks suggests that the attacker is modifying system configurations, possibly installing backdoors or changing settings to maintain access. Also, the repeated ImageLoad events for DLLs like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll might indicate an attempt to load malicious libraries or execute code in a protected environment.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows signs of potentially malicious activity. The combination of process creation, registry modifications, file deletions, and powershell usage with unclear command lines makes me lean towards classifying this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe execution with potentially malicious intent, including suspicious command-line arguments and file deletions that may indicate an attempt to remove evidence.

{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi4-mini\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. They're all in JSONL format, with each line being a separate event. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first few entries are about powershell.exe loading images. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that catches my attention. The files it's loading seem normal—mscorlib.ni.dll and clrjit.dll are part of the .NET framework, which is standard on Windows systems. However, seeing multiple ImageLoad events from powershell might be a red flag because attackers often use such events to load malicious components.\n\nNext, there's an event where a file is being deleted: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. Temporary script files generated by Powershell could be part of testing or they might be trying to bypass certain security policies. The naming includes \"ScriptPolicyTest,\" which makes me think it's related to how scripts are being executed, possibly indicating an attempt to evade detection.\n\nThen there's a process creation for winlogbeat.exe, which I recognize as an ELK stack component used for log management. That seems benign unless there's something wrong with its configuration or if it's being misused.\n\nI also notice several Registry value set events from various processes like powershell.exe and svchost.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware, so that's a point to consider. The same goes for process access events—accessing other processes' handles can indicate malicious activity, especially if it's done by a script or tool.\n\nThere are multiple instances where whoami.exe is being executed. While whoami is a legitimate command used to check user information, frequent executions without clear context could be part of reconnaissance activities to gather system information.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, there are several red flags:\n1. Multiple ImageLoad events from Powershell—could indicate loading malicious modules.\n2. Deletion of a temporary script file that might have been used for testing or evading policies.\n3. Registry modifications and process accesses which could be part of persistence or privilege escalation.\n4. Use of whoami.exe multiple times, possibly to gather system info.\n\nOn the other hand, some events like winlogbeat and notepad could be legitimate, but the volume of Powershell activity and related suspicious events makes me lean towards this batch being concerning. There's a pattern of Powershell activities combined with registry changes and process access, which are common in attack chains.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple powershell.exe processes loading images and accessing other processes, along with file deletions and registry modifications.

I'm going through each event one by one.\n\nThe first log shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That's probably normal since it's part of the logging system, maybe updating its configuration file.\n\nNext up is powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell can be used for good and bad things, so that might be a red flag. But without more context on what exactly it's doing, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe running, which is usually harmless as it just reports user information. That doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nPowershell.exe appears again in the logs. So two instances of it being accessed within this batch. Maybe someone is trying to execute commands or scripts through PowerShell, but without seeing any malicious commands, it's still unclear.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe accessing registry values. Both are standard system processes, so that activity seems normal. They might be checking some settings or configurations.\n\nLooking at chrome.exe logs: there are multiple DNS queries and network connections. That aligns with regular browsing behavior, especially if the user is visiting several sites or loading different resources. It doesn't indicate anything malicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are a couple of points that could raise an eyebrow—like the repeated powershell.exe accesses—the rest of the logs don't show any clear signs of malicious activity. Without more context or evidence of unusual behavior in those processes, this batch doesn't seem particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activities, including logging process creations and file accesses, which are not indicative of malicious behavior.\"\n}"}
