{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi4-mini\/scenario3\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a bunch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through each one step by step and see if anything stands out as suspicious.\n\nFirst event is powershell.exe creating a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. PowerShell scripts can do all sorts of things, but I'm not sure if this is normal yet.\n\nNext up are several events from chrome.exe setting registry values. That's a bit odd because Chrome doesn't usually modify the registry that much. Could be tracking some settings, but it's worth keeping an eye on, especially if there are multiple entries.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed with command line arguments. Whoami is typically used to get user information, so maybe legitimate, but I should check how often this runs and by whom.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event accessing a process without creating a file. Could be part of normal scripting, but access events can sometimes indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nLooking at the next powershell.exe event, it's setting a registry value too. Hmm, that's interesting because modifying the registry is a more privileged action and often used by malware to persistence.\n\nThe command line for this powershell.exe has a script path: Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with an output log in TEMP directory. That name sounds suspicious—.GetKey-strokes could be related to keylogging or data exfiltration. The script might be capturing keystrokes, which is definitely malicious activity.\n\nThere are multiple entries of the same command line for powershell.exe invoking Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This repetition suggests a possible installation of malware running at startup or through some persistence mechanism. Each time it runs, it logs keystrokes to key.log in TEMP.\n\nThen there's an image load event for mscoree.dll and clr-related files. These are legitimate .NET runtime components, but being loaded by powershell.exe could be part of executing the malicious script.\n\nAnother process create event for powershell.exe with a different command line path for Get-Keystrokes.ps1. Again, multiple such events suggest a broader campaign or installation across the system.\n\nFile creation and deletion of __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 in TEMP by powershell.exe is odd. This could be testing script execution policies or trying to bypass restrictions, which is another red flag.\n\nLastly, a pipe created event from powershell.exe. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, potentially allowing lateral movement or command and control within the system.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts with suspicious names, modifying the registry, creating files in TEMP, and using pipes. These behaviors are classic signs of malicious activity like keylogging, persistence mechanisms, and possible lateral movement. The repetition of similar commands across different processes suggests a coordinated attack or at least multiple modules of malware running.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts with suspicious names (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), modifying the registry, creating files in TEMP directories, and using pipes.

{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi4-mini\/scenario3\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: It mentions powershell.exe running a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with an argument pointing to the TEMP directory for logging keystrokes. That sounds suspicious because scripts named like that are often used for keylogging, which is malicious activity. The command line has two different paths in separate events, which might indicate multiple instances or attempts.\n\nSecond event: Powershell.exe loading urlmon.dll from System32. I know powershell can load various DLLs, but urlmon is related to URL handling and could be part of legitimate processes, but sometimes it's used maliciously for downloading files or executing code remotely.\n\nThird and fourth events: These are about file creation by powershell.exe in the Windows PowerShell StartupProfileData directory. That might be normal if it's user profile initialization, but combined with the earlier script execution, it could mean something is being loaded on startup which might be persistence mechanism.\n\nFifth event: Similar to the first one, another instance of powershell.exe running Get-Keystrokes.ps1, again pointing to TEMP for logs. This repetition raises red flags—could be multiple attempts or different scripts trying to log activity.\n\nSixth event: There's an execute a remote command task. The file path points to a script in a directory with 'elemento_secundario', which translates to secondary element. That seems unusual, and the script name again is Get-Keystrokes, reinforcing the malicious activity.\n\nSeventh to eleventh events: These are about files being created by winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe. Winlogbeat is likely an ELK stack component used for log management, so its file creation might be legitimate. Svchost.exe is a known Windows process that can be both legitimate and part of malware; the path here seems normal for delivery optimization.\n\nLooking at all events together: There are multiple powershell.exe instances running scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with logging to TEMP. These scripts could be designed to capture keystrokes, which is definitely malicious. The presence of remote command execution adds another layer—perhaps trying to download additional malware or exfiltrate data.\n\nThe repetition of similar process events for powershell and the specific script names are concerning. Even though some file creations by other processes seem benign, the overall pattern suggests potential unauthorized access or malicious activity on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe running potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) with keystroke logging functionality detected. Suspicious file creation and remote command execution activities observed.\"\n}\n```"}
