While possible, without additional context indicating unusual behavior (like multiple failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or other anomalies), these events alone don't suggest malicious intent.

Each event corresponds to different files being created, such as invertObj.d.ts, invokeMap.d.ts, etc.\n\nI know that git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments. The file creation events here seem related to TypeScript definition files (d.ts) within the Cypress node_modules.

There's nothing unusual in terms of file names or locations that would indicate malicious activity.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, each event is in JSONL format, which means one JSON object per line. The events all have the same structure: process name is \"git.exe\", the task is \"File created\" with a specific rule, and the file path points to various .d.ts files under the node_modules directory for cypress and lodash.\n\nSo, what's happening here? It seems like multiple files are being created by git.exe. The paths all lead to TypeScript definition files in the node_modules folder of a project named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". This looks like it's part of a development environment, possibly for software testing or quality assurance since cypress is mentioned.\n\nNow, considering cybersecurity, I'm wondering if these events indicate any malicious activity. git.exe is commonly used in version control systems and isn't inherently malicious. The act of creating files under node_modules is typical during development, especially when installing or updating packages with npm or yarn. These .d.ts files are TypeScript type definitions which are standard for projects using TypeScript.\n\nI should check if these file creations could be part of a larger pattern that might indicate compromise. However, the repetition and consistency in the paths suggest normal script execution rather than anything suspicious. There's no indication of unusual file names, access to sensitive areas beyond the project directory, or other red flags like multiple processes or deviations from expected behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to monitor for any unexpected activity, these events align with typical development workflows and don't pose a security risk.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe within the node_modules directory, which are normal during development setup and not indicative of malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}

Each one is a JSON object representing an event from the system logs. The first thing that stands out is that all these events are coming from the same process: git.exe. That's interesting because git is commonly used for version control in software development. \n\nLooking deeper into each event, they all have the same task description: \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So it seems like git.exe is creating a bunch of files. The file paths are all under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\. Each path ends with .d.ts, which I know stands for TypeScript declaration files.

The process name is consistently \"git.exe\". The winlog task mentions a file creation event, which suggests that a file was created on the system.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\" followed by different filenames. These seem to be TypeScript definition files (d.ts) related to Lodash functions. Examples include xorWith.d.ts, zip.d.ts, etc.\n\nNow, considering the context: git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments. The node_modules folder indicates this is part of a Node.js project. Cypress is likely being used as a testing framework here since it's a popular choice for end-to-end tests in JavaScript applications.\n\nThe events show multiple file creation actions from git.exe within the cypress\/types\/lodash directory. Since these are TypeScript type definitions, their creation is standard during development setup or when installing dependencies. Each file corresponds to different Lodash functions, which suggests that the project is setting up type definitions for better IDE support and code clarity.\n\nI should check if these activities are normal. In a typical development workflow, especially with Node.js projects, installing packages via npm would trigger the creation of various files in node_modules. Git being involved might be part of a CI\/CD process or just regular version control usage.\n\nIs there anything unusual here? The user is creating multiple .d.ts files related to Lodash functions. This doesn't seem suspicious because it's common for projects to define type information, especially when using third-party libraries like Lodash. There's no indication of any malicious activity such as file creation in restricted directories, attempts to access sensitive data, or execution of scripts outside expected behavior.\n\nAlso, the fact that all events are from git.exe and relate to creating these specific files doesn't raise red flags. It looks consistent with a developer environment where dependencies are being managed and type definitions are set up automatically or manually.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access, encryption activities, data exfiltration, or other indicators of compromise.

They all have similar structures: the process name is \"git.exe\", and the Windows log indicates that a file was created with the specific rule \"FileCreate\". The file paths are all within the node_modules directory of a Cypress project, specifically under the lodash types folder. Each event points to a different .d.ts file being created.\n\nHmm, so what's happening here? Git is often used for version control, especially in development environments. The creation of these files might be part of a build process or when setting up a project. Node_modules is where npm packages are stored, and Cypress is a testing tool that relies on lodash for utility functions.\n\nEach file created seems to be a type definition (.d.ts) related to lodash functions like isDate, isEmpty, etc. These are common in TypeScript projects to provide type information for JavaScript libraries. So, it's likely that the system is building or initializing the project, and these files are being generated as part of that setup.\n\nSince all events involve the same process (git.exe) creating multiple files in a predictable location related to development tools, this doesn't raise any red flags. It seems like standard behavior when working with Node.js and TypeScript projects. There's no indication of unusual activity or signs of malicious intent here.\n\nI don't see any anomalies such as access to restricted areas, attempts to execute scripts outside the project scope, or repeated failed attempts that might indicate brute force attacks.
