{"file":"data\/events\/scenario4\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines representing system events. My job is to look at all of them together and decide if they're relevant.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. There's a lot here, so I need to spot any patterns or suspicious activities. Let me start by noting the processes involved. There's svchost.exe, MpDefenderCoreService.exe, chrome.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, net.exe, net1.exe, conhost.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. \n\nLooking at the tasks, there are Dns queries, Network connections, Process accesses, Registry changes, and File creations. The first few events seem normal, like svchost handling DNS queries and MpDefenderCoreService making network connections. But then there's chrome.exe making multiple network connections. That could be normal, but combined with other events, maybe not.\n\nWait, the cmd.exe processes have command lines that look like they're adding users to the domain with net user and net group commands. The commands include creating a user with a password and adding them to the Domain Admins group. That's definitely suspicious. Also, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes \"net user \\\"pacote_principal_Admin\\\" \\\"registro_temporario_pass123!\\\" \/add \/domain\" and similar for group. This looks like an attempt to create a domain admin account, which is a common tactic in credential stuffing or lateral movement attacks.\n\nThen there's the use of net1.exe, which might be a renamed or malicious tool. The command lines for net1.exe are similar to net.exe but with a different name, which could be a red herring or part of obfuscation. Also, the presence of multiple Registry value set events might indicate changes to system settings or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe FileCreate events involve creating files like .winlogbeat.yml.new and pacote_base.txt. These could be logs or configuration files, but the names might be misleading. The fact that they're created by processes like winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe might be normal, but combined with the user account creation, it's part of a larger suspicious activity.\n\nAlso, the use of PowerShell for process access and registry changes could be part of a script that's trying to establish persistence or modify system settings. The multiple ProcessAccess events might indicate that a process is trying to access other processes, which is a common behavior in malware for privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch seems to involve creating domain admin users, modifying registry settings, and using PowerShell and cmd.exe for these actions. The combination of these activities points towards a potential compromise, possibly an attempt to gain elevated privileges or establish a foothold in the network. The presence of multiple network connections and DNS queries could be part of exfiltration or C2 (command and control) activities. The file creations might be for storing malicious payloads or configuration files.\n\nI should also note that some events are repeated, like the FileCreate for SRUtmp.log by svchost.exe, which might be normal, but the other file creations are more suspicious. The overall pattern suggests a coordinated attack, so the answer should be that this batch is interesting and requires investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided batch of system events exhibits **suspicious behavior indicative of a potential compromise or adversarial activity**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Suspicious Activities:\n1. **Domain User Creation via `cmd.exe`:**\n   - Multiple `cmd.exe` processes execute commands like:\n     ```\n     net user \"pacote_principal_Admin\" \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" \/add \/domain\n     net group \"Domain Admins\" \"pacote_principal_Admin\" \/add\n     ```\n     These commands **create a domain user with a password** and add it to the **Domain Admins group**, a classic tactic for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Tools (`net1.exe`):**\n   - The use of `net1.exe` (a renamed or malicious tool) alongside `net.exe` suggests **obfuscation** to evade detection. The commands mirror `net.exe` but with a different name, possibly indicating a red herring or malicious payload.\n\n3. **Registry Manipulation:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events (via `powershell.exe`) could indicate **configuration changes** for persistence, privilege escalation, or malware deployment.\n\n4. **File Creation with Suspicious Paths:**\n   - Files like `pacote_base.txt` and `.winlogbeat.yml.new` are created by `powershell.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe`. While some may be benign (e.g., log files), the context of user account creation and registry changes raises flags for **malicious payload storage**.\n\n5. **Network and DNS Activity:**\n   - `chrome.exe` and `svchost.exe` generate DNS queries and network connections. While normal, the **combination with user creation and file creation** suggests potential **C2 (command and control)** or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **PowerShell for Process Access:**\n   - `powershell.exe` repeatedly triggers `ProcessAccess` events, which could indicate **monitoring or manipulating other processes** for privilege escalation.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise:\n- **Lateral Movement**: Creating domain admin accounts enables access to sensitive resources.\n- **Persistence**: Registry changes and file creation may establish long-term access.\n- **Obfuscation**: Use of `net1.exe` and renamed tools suggests evasion tactics.\n- **Privilege Escalation**: Adding a user to the Domain Admins group is a clear indicator of attacker intent.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis batch of events **deserves immediate investigation**. The combination of user creation, registry manipulation, obfuscated tools, and network activity strongly suggests a **malicious actor** attempting to compromise the system. Security teams should:\n- Check for unauthorized domain account creation.\n- Analyze the files `pacote_base.txt` and `.winlogbeat.yml.new` for malicious content.\n- Investigate `net1.exe` and other unusual processes.\n- Monitor network traffic for C2 activity.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThis batch is **highly suspicious** and requires urgent investigation. The activities align with adversarial tactics such as lateral movement, persistence, and privilege escalation."}
