Then whoami.exe is created, which is a common command for checking user permissions. Next, cmd.exe is used to set a registry value. Wait, there's a reg.exe process that's adding a registry key to run a temporary package executable. That seems suspicious. Then another cmd.exe setting a registry value, and again powershell.exe accessing a process. \n\nPutting this together, the reg.exe command is adding an entry to the Run key, which would execute pacote_temporario.exe at startup. That's a red flag for persistence. The use of cmd.exe and reg.exe to modify the registry suggests an attempt to make the malware run automatically. Even though some commands are normal (like whoami), the combination points to malicious activity. The presence of a temporary executable in the registry path is concerning. So the batch is definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious registry modification attempts using reg.exe to add a persistent entry for 'pacote_temporario.exe', combined with PowerShell\/cmd.exe process creation and access events, indicating potential malware persistence and execution.\"\n}"}
