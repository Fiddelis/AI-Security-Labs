{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario4\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a log event. My job is to look at all of them together and decide if they're relevant.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are a lot of registry value set events, process creations, and some image loads. Let me check for any suspicious patterns. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a cmd.exe process that runs a command to add a user with a name like \"modulo_geral_Admin\" and a password. Then there's net.exe and net1.exe adding users to the administrators group. That seems like a classic attempt to create a new admin account, which is a common tactic in malware or privilege escalation attacks. \n\nAlso, there's a process access to powershell.exe, which might be part of the attack chain. The use of net1.exe, which isn't a standard Windows tool, could be a red flag. The fact that multiple processes are adding users and modifying registry keys suggests coordinated activity. \n\nSome of the other events are normal, like Chrome or OneDrive, but the combination of user account management and registry changes points towards a potential security incident. The presence of multiple process creations and registry modifications in a short time frame could indicate a compromise. \n\nI should also check if there's any evidence of persistence or lateral movement. The creation of new admin accounts is a sign of trying to maintain access. The use of PowerShell and command line tools to execute these actions is also suspicious. \n\nEven though there are some benign processes, the overall pattern of user account manipulation and registry changes is concerning. This batch seems to indicate a possible attack attempting to elevate privileges and establish a foothold. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with a justification about the user account modifications and registry changes.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious user account management (adding admin users via net.exe\/net1.exe) and registry modifications, likely indicating privilege escalation attempts. The use of cmd.exe with complex commands and non-standard processes like net1.exe suggests potential malicious activity.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario4\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. The events are in JSONL format, so I need to analyze them as a whole.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve 'chrome.exe' performing registry value sets. There are multiple entries where the same process is setting registry values. That could be normal, but repeated actions might indicate something else. Then there's an image load event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is related to Anti-Malware Scan Interface, which is part of Windows. But MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender, so maybe that's normal. However, if Chrome is loading these, maybe it's part of normal operation, but I need to check if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nThen there's an event where 'winlogbeat.exe' creates a file in the downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be legitimate. But the file path is in the downloads directory, which could be a place where malicious files are stored. However, the user is named 'fiddelis', which might be a username, so maybe it's a legitimate user action.\n\nAnother event is 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'componente_secundario.txt'. PowerShell is often used in both legitimate and malicious contexts. Creating a file with that name could be part of a script, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the filename isn't obviously malicious, but the use of PowerShell might be a red flag.\n\nLooking at all the events together, there's a lot of registry changes by Chrome. If Chrome is making repeated registry modifications, that could be a sign of a malware attempting to persist or modify system settings. The image load events for Defender components might be normal, but the combination with registry changes could be suspicious. The file creations by winlogbeat and PowerShell might be part of normal operations, but the presence of multiple processes modifying the registry could indicate a larger pattern.\n\nConsidering that the user is analyzing this batch, the repeated registry changes by Chrome, along with the file creations, might be part of a coordinated effort. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or the content of the files created, it's a bit hard to confirm. But given the frequency and the combination of events, it's worth investigating. So the classification would be INTERESTING because there's a potential for malicious activity, especially with the registry modifications and the use of PowerShell.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe combined with image load events for system DLLs and file creation by suspicious processes (winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) suggest potential persistence or tampering attempts. The repetitive registry changes could indicate malware activity.\"\n}"}
