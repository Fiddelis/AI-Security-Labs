{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi4-mini\/scenario5\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if this is relevant for investigation. Let me start by analyzing each event and then see how they connect.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries with PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks. Each command uses New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, which is a legitimate Windows application, but it's being triggered at logon with the Administrators group and highest run level. That's suspicious because scheduled tasks with elevated privileges could be used for persistence. The fact that there are multiple tasks with different names (like unidade_ativo, registro_geral, etc.) might indicate an attempt to create multiple tasks, possibly to evade detection or ensure one survives if others are removed.\n\nLooking at the registry events, there are several Registry value set events. PowerShell is accessing the registry, which could be part of normal operations, but combined with the scheduled task creation, it might be part of a larger script or malware setup. The presence of multiple registry accesses could be a sign of configuration changes or data exfiltration.\n\nThere's also a process access event, which might indicate that another process is trying to access the PowerShell process, which could be a sign of lateral movement or privilege escalation. The image load events show various DLLs being loaded, including some from the Windows Defender directory. While some of these are legitimate, the combination with the scheduled task creation might suggest that the PowerShell process is being used to load malicious modules or to bypass security software.\n\nOne event mentions a file deletion in the Temp directory. Deleting temporary files could be part of cleaning up after a script or to remove evidence. However, if the file being deleted is a script, it might be part of a larger attack where the script was used to execute malicious code and then deleted to avoid detection.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell processes and the variety of events (scheduled tasks, registry changes, file deletions, image loads) suggests that there's a coordinated effort to perform some action on the system. The use of elevated privileges and the creation of multiple tasks points towards persistence mechanisms. The combination of these activities could be indicative of a malware or attacker attempting to maintain access or execute payloads.\n\nI should also consider if there's any pattern or if certain events are repeated. For example, the scheduled task creation is repeated with different names, which might be an attempt to avoid detection by having multiple entry points. The fact that some of the image loads are from the Windows Defender directory might be a red herring, but it's worth noting that the malware might be trying to evade detection by loading legitimate DLLs.\n\nIn summary, the combination of scheduled task creation with elevated privileges, registry modifications, process access, and file deletions, all through PowerShell, raises several red flags. These activities are commonly associated with malicious operations such as persistence, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration. Therefore, this batch of events is relevant for investigation as it could indicate a security breach or the presence of malicious software.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event logs exhibit several suspicious activities that strongly indicate a potential security threat. Here's a structured analysis of the key concerns:\n\n### **1. Scheduled Task Creation with Elevated Privileges**\n- **Repeated Task Creation**: Multiple PowerShell commands create scheduled tasks (`unidade_ativo`, `registro_geral`, etc.) using `New-ScheduledTaskAction` to execute `calc.exe` at logon. This is unusual for legitimate use and suggests **persistence mechanisms**.\n- **Elevated Privileges**: Tasks are configured with the **Administrators group** and **highest run level**, which could enable **privilege escalation** or **malicious payload execution**.\n\n### **2. Registry Modifications**\n- **Registry Access**: Multiple `Registry value set` events (e.g., `PipeCreated`, `ImageLoad`) indicate PowerShell is modifying or accessing critical registry keys. This could be part of **configuring persistence**, **data exfiltration**, or **disabling security tools**.\n\n### **3. Process Access and Lateral Movement**\n- **Process Access**: Events like `Process accessed` (e.g., `ProcessAccess`) suggest **lateral movement** or **privilege escalation** attempts. An attacker might be probing or manipulating other processes to gain control.\n\n### **4. Image Load and DLL Injection**\n- **Suspicious DLLs**: PowerShell loads DLLs from system directories (e.g., `MpOAV.dll` from Windows Defender). While some are legitimate, the combination with other malicious activities could indicate **DLL injection** or **bypassing antivirus detection**.\n- **Malicious Module Loading**: The use of `mscorlib.ni.dll` and `clr.dll` might be part of **obfuscation** or **runtime execution of malicious code**.\n\n### **5. File Deletion and Cleanup**\n- **Temporary File Deletion**: A file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) in the `Temp` directory is deleted. This could be an attempt to **remove evidence** of a script used for exploitation or malware execution.\n\n### **6. PowerShell as a Vector**\n- **PowerShell Abuses**: The heavy use of PowerShell for task creation, registry changes, and image loading is a **common attack vector** for malware (e.g., **PowerShell-based ransomware**, **APT tools**). The combination of these actions suggests **malicious automation**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events collectively point to **malicious activity** likely involving **persistence**, **privilege escalation**, and **payload execution**. The use of elevated privileges, repeated task creation, registry modifications, and PowerShell-based operations are red flags for **malware or attacker activity**. This batch of logs is **highly relevant for investigation** to identify and mitigate potential threats. \n\n**Recommendation**: \n- Analyze the deleted script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) for malicious content.\n- Check for unauthorized scheduled tasks and remove them.\n- Investigate registry changes to determine if security tools (e.g., Windows Defender) are being disabled.\n- Monitor for further lateral movement or process injection attempts."}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi4-mini\/scenario5\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a log event. My job is to look at all of them together and decide if they're relevant.\n\nFirst, I'll start by scanning through each event. The first event has a process with a command line that's using PowerShell to create a scheduled task. The command line seems to be setting up a task that runs calc.exe at logon with admin privileges. That's a bit suspicious because creating a scheduled task with high privileges could be a sign of malware trying to persist on the system. The task name is \"estrutura_auxiliar\" and another one called \"unidade_comum\", which might be obfuscated names.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Chrome.exe setting registry values. Registry changes can be part of normal operations, but repeated entries might indicate something else. Also, Chrome.exe is being used here, but if there's a lot of registry activity, it could be a red flag. \n\nThere's also a mention of \"Execute a Remote Command\" with process None. That's a bit unclear. If the process is None, maybe it's a system event or something related to remote execution. But I need to check if that's part of a larger pattern.\n\nAnother event is about WmiPrvSE.exe loading an image, specifically taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate system file, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, maybe that's a sign of something. Then there's svchost.exe creating a file in the Tasks directory, which is a bit odd. Creating files in system directories might be part of normal operations, but if it's a new file, it could be a threat.\n\nPowerShell is also creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive path. That's a bit suspicious because PowerShell is often used in malicious scripts. And there are registry changes and image loads related to Chrome and Defender, which might be normal, but combined with other activities, could indicate something.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several signs that could point to malicious activity. The creation of scheduled tasks with admin privileges, multiple registry changes, file creations in system directories, and PowerShell usage all together might indicate an attempt to persist or execute malicious code. Even though some events might be normal, the combination and repetition of certain actions (like multiple registry sets from Chrome) could be part of a larger attack. The presence of \"Execute a Remote Command\" with no process might also be a red flag. So, the classification should be INTERESTING because there's a potential for malicious activity here that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges (calc.exe execution), repeated registry modifications, and file creations in system directories. These actions, combined with 'Execute a Remote Command' events and suspicious process behaviors, suggest potential persistence mechanisms or malicious activity warranting investigation.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi4-mini\/scenario5\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to analyze all of them as a whole and determine if they're relevant for investigation. The output should be a single classification with a justification.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. The first event is chrome.exe setting a registry value. Then there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file, and powershell.exe creating another file. Then multiple instances of chrome.exe setting registry values again. Finally, chrome.exe doing a DNS query and another file creation by powershell.\n\nHmm, the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe could be suspicious. Maybe someone is trying to persist changes or modify settings. The file creations by winlogbeat and powershell might be normal, but if these files are being created in user downloads, maybe they're temporary. However, the fact that there are multiple registry modifications, especially from chrome.exe, which is usually a legitimate process, might indicate something else. Could be a malicious actor using chrome.exe to make registry changes. Also, the DNS query by chrome.exe could be part of normal operation, but combined with the registry changes, it might be a sign of some activity. \n\nBut wait, the files created by powershell are in the downloads directory. Maybe they're legitimate, like scripts or configuration files. However, the repeated registry modifications might be a red flag. Also, the same process (chrome.exe) is doing multiple registry tasks. Maybe it's a multi-step attack where the attacker is using chrome.exe to make changes and then querying DNS for something. \n\nAlternatively, it could be benign, like a user running some scripts or apps that modify the registry. But without more context, the pattern of repeated registry changes and file creations could be worth investigating. The classification should be INTERESTING because the combination of multiple registry modifications and file creations by different processes might indicate potential malicious activity, even if some actions are normal. The justification needs to be concise, pointing out the suspicious patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe (potentially malicious persistence) combined with file creations by powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe in user directories, suggesting potential unauthorized configuration changes or data exfiltration attempts.\"\n}"}
