There are also signs of potential privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts, such as the use of cmdkey.exe to list stored credentials, creation of a new process 'net1.exe' similar to a legitimate one, and multiple registry modifications by Chrome. Furthermore, an unusual helper program (SDXHelper.exe) loads a common system DLL which might be indicative of malware using DLL hijacking techniques. The combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity worthy of investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
