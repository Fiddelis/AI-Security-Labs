Additionally, the creation of a service ('win32times') via 'sc.exe' with an invalid script path suggests a potential attempt to execute malicious code or gain persistence. Frequent registry modifications by processes like 'services.exe', 'RuntimeBroker.exe', and 'svchost.exe', often associated with legitimate system functions but sometimes used in obfuscation or persistence, further indicate potentially malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
