This behavior, combined with registry value modifications and deletion of specific files, is often indicative of scripting or automation attempts that could be malicious. The use of obfuscated paths in the script commands also raises suspicion about potential data exfiltration or tampering. Additionally, the loading of specific modules such as 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive' further suggests automation scripts with intent to package and potentially move files around.\"\n}\n```"}
