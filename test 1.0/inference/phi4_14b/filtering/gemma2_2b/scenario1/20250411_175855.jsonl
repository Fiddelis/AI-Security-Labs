The use of scripts like powershell.exe and cmd.exe with suspicious command lines (e.g., searching for `.key` files) can be associated with attempts to locate encryption keys or sensitive data, which is a typical tactic in ransomware attacks. Additionally, multiple registry value modifications by different processes such as cmd.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and svchost.exe could indicate attempts to persist malicious activities or alter system configurations. The frequent access and creation of files using tools like winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe might suggest efforts to either manipulate log data or create backdoors.\"\n}\n```"}
