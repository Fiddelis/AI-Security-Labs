Additionally, there are repeated registry value set operations and file creation events, especially involving 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a new configuration file, which could indicate an attempt to persist changes or evade detection by modifying logging configurations. The use of 'conhost.exe' and 'RuntimeBroker.exe' for setting registry values is unusual and potentially suspicious, as these processes are not typically associated with such tasks.\"\n}\n```"}
