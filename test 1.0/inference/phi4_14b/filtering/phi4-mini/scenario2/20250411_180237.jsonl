Notably, there are events involving registry value modifications and process accesses using PowerShell, often associated with privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms in attacks. The presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files could indicate attempts to modify logging configurations or exfiltrate data. Additionally, the use of 'tasklist.exe' loading critical system libraries like 'amsi.dll' may suggest attempts to disable security features such as AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface). These indicators collectively warrant further investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
