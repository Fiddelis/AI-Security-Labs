{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the processes mentioned. There's a lot of PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe activities. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. But when combined with other events, it might be a red flag. For example, the command line in one of the cmd.exe entries is \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". That seems odd because deleting a process like notepad.exe might be part of a cleanup or could be part of a malicious act to remove evidence. Also, using WMIC to delete processes isn't typical and might be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThen there's the use of schtasks.exe with the command to delete a task named \"win32times\". Scheduled tasks being deleted could be part of an attack to remove persistence mechanisms. However, without knowing what the original task was, it's hard to say for sure, but the deletion itself is suspicious.\n\nLooking at the file paths, there's a mention of amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll being loaded. AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) is used by Windows Defender. If a process is loading these DLLs, it might be trying to bypass detection. For example, if a malicious process is loading amsi.dll, it might be attempting to disable or subvert the antimalware scanning. But in this case, the events show that chrome.exe and another process loaded these DLLs. However, chrome.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's loading these DLLs in an unusual context, that could be a problem. Alternatively, maybe it's just normal operation, but the combination with other events is what's important here.\n\nAnother point is the repeated access to processes like PowerShell and the use of registry value sets. Frequent registry changes can indicate configuration changes by malware. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they are benign or malicious.\n\nThe presence of 'whoami.exe' is normal, as it's used to get user information, but if it's being run in a suspicious context, that could be an issue. However, in the logs provided, it's just being run normally.\n\nThe 'conhost.exe' is a legitimate Windows process, but again, if it's involved in unusual activities, that's a concern. However, in the logs, it's just doing registry value sets, which might be part of normal operations.\n\nThe key points here are the deletion of a process via WMIC, the deletion of a scheduled task, and the loading of amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll by chrome.exe. These could be signs of an attacker trying to clean up traces or disable security features. However, some of these might be normal, but the combination of multiple suspicious events could indicate a potential threat.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch has several events that are potentially suspicious, such as the deletion of processes, deletion of scheduled tasks, and loading of security-related DLLs. While some of these could be benign, the combination and the nature of the commands used (like using WMIC to delete processes) are indicative of malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Malicious Use of `WMIC` and `cmd.exe`:**\n   - **Event:** `cmd.exe` executed with the command:  \n     `wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete`  \n   - **Risk:** This command attempts to delete the `notepad.exe` process, which could be part of an attack to terminate a legitimate process or remove evidence of malicious activity. `WMIC` is often abused by attackers for lateral movement or process manipulation.\n\n2. **Deletion of Scheduled Tasks:**\n   - **Event:** `schtasks.exe` executed with:  \n     `schtasks.exe \/delete \/tn \"win32times\" \/f`  \n   - **Risk:** Deleting a scheduled task named \"win32times\" may indicate an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms or evade detection. The task name is vague and could be a red herring or part of a larger attack chain.\n\n3. **Loading of Security-Related DLLs:**\n   - **Events:**  \n     - `chrome.exe` loaded `C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll`  \n     - `chrome.exe` loaded `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll`  \n   - **Risk:** While these DLLs are legitimate (part of Windows Defender), their loading by `chrome.exe` (a non-antivirus process) could indicate an attempt to bypass antimalware scanning or inject malicious code. This is a common tactic in advanced persistent threats (APTs).\n\n4. **Frequent Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Events:** Multiple entries involving `Registry value set` or `Registry object added\/deleted` by processes like `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `powershell.exe`.  \n   - **Risk:** Frequent or unexplained registry changes may indicate malware modifying system behavior, such as disabling security features or creating backdoors.\n\n5. **Abuse of PowerShell and `cmd.exe`:**\n   - **Events:** Repeated use of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` with no clear legitimate purpose.  \n   - **Risk:** These tools are often exploited by attackers for execution, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events is **highly suspicious** and requires further investigation. The combination of **process deletion**, **scheduled task removal**, **unusual DLL loading**, and **frequent registry modifications** suggests potential malicious activity, such as **post-exploitation cleanup**, **persistence removal**, or **antivirus evasion**. Immediate steps should include:\n- Analyzing the full context (e.g., process trees, network traffic, file hashes).\n- Checking for signs of **living off the land** (LOTL) attacks or **malware injection**.\n- Validating the legitimacy of the `win32times` task and the purpose of the DLLs loaded by `chrome.exe`.\n\n**Action Required:** Investigate further using forensic tools (e.g., SIEM, EDR) and correlate with other logs to confirm malicious intent."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe and conhost.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The events mention things like registry value sets, process accesses, and image loads. \n\nWait, there are several entries where PowerShell is loading images. For example, mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. That's normal because PowerShell can use these components, but I should check if there's anything unusual. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. Creating a script in Temp might be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers do that to execute malicious code. \n\nLooking at the command lines, some of them are just empty scripts like \"& {}\" which might be testing or benign. However, there are a few that check for the existence of certain .bat files. The paths mentioned are a bit odd, like \"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\". The use of \"..\" suggests they're navigating directories, but that's common in scripts. However, the filenames have non-English characters and seem to be in paths that might not be standard. \n\nAlso, the fact that multiple events involve registry value sets and process accesses could indicate an attempt to modify system settings or access other processes, which might be part of a larger attack. The repeated events of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent might be part of a pattern that's not typical for normal user activity. \n\nAnother thing is the presence of the file \"StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\" being created. This might be related to PowerShell profiles, which can be used to execute scripts automatically. If this is being created in a non-interactive context, that could be suspicious. \n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to overreact. Some of these activities could be legitimate, like updating scripts or testing paths. But the combination of multiple PowerShell events, registry changes, and file creation in Temp directories might indicate a potential security incident. \n\nI should also check if there's any mention of network activity or other suspicious processes, but in this batch, the focus is on local file system and registry operations. The presence of the Windows Defender DLL being loaded might be normal, but it's worth noting. \n\nOverall, the repeated PowerShell activities, combined with registry modifications and file creation in temporary directories, along with the non-standard paths, make this batch interesting for further investigation. It's not a clear-cut malicious activity, but the pattern is unusual enough to warrant closer look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a pattern of activity that warrants further investigation due to several potentially suspicious indicators:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **High Frequency of PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **`powershell.exe`** is involved in multiple events, including:\n     - **Registry modifications** (`RegistryEvent`).\n     - **File creation** in temporary directories (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1`).\n     - **Path checks** for `.bat` files with non-standard, obfuscated paths (e.g., `C:\\entrada_principal\\unidade_auxiliar\\..\\elemento_geral\\objeto_ativo_script.bat`). The use of `..` suggests directory traversal, which could be part of evasion techniques.\n\n2. **Suspicious File Creation:**\n   - A script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1`) is created in the **Temp directory**, which is a common tactic for adversaries to execute payloads discreetly. While not inherently malicious, this could indicate an attempt to bypass execution policies or hide malicious code.\n\n3. **Non-Standard Paths and Naming:**\n   - The paths referenced in the PowerShell commands (e.g., `C:\\objeto_comum\\estrutura_base\\..\\estrutura_base\\pacote_padrao_script.bat`) contain **non-English terms** and nested directory structures. This may indicate obfuscation or an attempt to avoid detection by using non-ASCII characters or misleading paths.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access Events:**\n   - Repeated **`RegistryEvent`** and **`ProcessAccess`** entries involving `conhost.exe` and `powershell.exe` could signal attempts to **modify system settings** or **interact with other processes**, which may be part of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\n5. **Potential for Automation:**\n   - The creation of `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` suggests **PowerShell profile customization**, which could be used to execute scripts automatically in non-interactive sessions. This might be leveraged for persistence or lateral movement.\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **File Paths:**  \n  - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1`  \n  - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`  \n- **Command-Line Arguments:**  \n  - `& {if (Test-Path \"C:\\...script.bat\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}` (repeated with obfuscated paths).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for **network activity**, **user behavior**, or **unusual authentication events** that might contextualize these actions (e.g., lateral movement, data exfiltration).\n- **Analyze the Created Script:** Investigate the content of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1` to determine if it contains malicious code.\n- **Monitor PowerShell Usage:** Enforce strict **execution policies** and monitor script execution via **PowerShell logging** or **EDR tools**.\n- **Check for Obfuscation:** The non-English paths and repetitive `Test-Path` commands may indicate obfuscation or a custom attack chain.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile not definitively malicious, the combination of **unusual file paths**, **repeated PowerShell activity**, and **registry\/process modifications** raises **red flags** that merit further investigation. This could represent a **legitimate administrative task**, **benign testing**, or **early-stage adversarial activity**. Contextual analysis and deeper forensic examination are required to determine intent. \n\n**Verdict:** ✅ **Interesting for investigation** due to suspicious patterns and potential obfuscation."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of JSONL events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at the entire batch as a whole, not individual events.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple PowerShell processes being created. The command lines are similar, using Test-Path to check for the existence of certain .bat files and exiting with 0 or 1. These paths have a pattern with directories like \"modulo_geral\", \"estrutura_geral\", \"modulo_logico\", etc., which might be part of a naming convention, but the actual files they're checking for (like \"tarefa_padrao_script.bat\") seem to be specific. However, just checking if a file exists doesn't necessarily indicate malicious behavior unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen there are events related to image loading, like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll. These are .NET framework components, which are normal for PowerShell scripts that use .NET. So that's probably just standard operation.\n\nThere's also a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1. The creation and deletion of a temporary script file might be normal, but if it's part of a script that's being executed, maybe that's worth looking into. However, the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which sounds like it could be related to testing script policies, which might be legitimate.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are several registry value set events for both PowerShell and Chrome. Chrome's registry events are repeated multiple times, but without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious. However, the fact that Chrome is involved here might be a red herring unless there's something specific about the registry keys being modified.\n\nNow, the key thing here is that all the PowerShell events are related to checking if certain batch files exist. If these .bat files are part of a legitimate setup or application, then this is normal. However, if the paths are obfuscated or if the files are being used in a way that's not typical, that could be suspicious. But in the given data, the paths are consistent and don't show signs of obfuscation or unusual directories.\n\nAnother point is that the same pattern of Test-Path checks is repeated multiple times, which might indicate that the scripts are trying to determine the presence of certain files as part of their execution flow. However, without seeing the actual content of the .bat files or more context on what these scripts are doing, it's hard to label them as malicious.\n\nThe presence of multiple image loads for .NET components is normal for PowerShell, so that's not a red flag. The temporary file creation and deletion might be part of a legitimate script execution process, like testing or running a script that's then cleaned up.\n\nConsidering all this, there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The events are mostly related to normal PowerShell operations, .NET components, and temporary file handling. Unless there's a specific context or additional indicators (like unexpected network activity, unusual command-line arguments, or unexpected file modifications), these events don't seem to warrant an investigation. Therefore, the batch of events is likely not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Event Batch:**\n\nThe provided event logs consist of multiple PowerShell and Chrome-related activities, primarily involving file existence checks, .NET component loading, and temporary file creation\/deletion. Here's a structured breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Script Behavior:**\n   - **Test-Path Commands:** Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like `if (Test-Path \"C:\\...\\.bat\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }`. These checks are common in scripts to verify the presence of files (e.g., configuration files, dependencies).\n   - **File Paths:** The paths (e.g., `modulo_geral`, `modulo_logico`, `elemento_auxiliar`) follow a structured naming convention, possibly part of a legitimate application or framework. No obfuscation or suspicious directory structures are evident.\n   - **Exit Codes:** The use of `exit 0`\/`exit 1` is standard for conditional logic in scripts and does not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n\n2. **.NET Component Loading:**\n   - **Image Loads:** Events involving `mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, and `clr.dll` are normal for PowerShell scripts leveraging the .NET Framework. These are not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n3. **Temporary File Activity:**\n   - **File Created\/Deleted:** A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`) is created in the Temp directory and subsequently deleted. This is consistent with legitimate script execution workflows (e.g., testing, cleanup). The filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which may relate to policy validation, a plausible benign use case.\n\n4. **Chrome-Related Events:**\n   - **Registry Modifications:** Multiple registry value set events for `chrome.exe` are logged. While repetitive, no specific malicious registry keys or actions are indicated. Chrome's activity is unrelated to the PowerShell events and does not raise immediate concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **No Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** There are no signs of lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. The activities align with standard scripting and application behavior.\n- **Legitimate Use Cases:** The observed behavior (file checks, .NET usage, temporary file handling) is consistent with legitimate administrative or application workflows.\n- **Lack of Anomalies:** No deviations from expected patterns (e.g., unusual processes, unexpected network traffic, or unauthorized file modifications) are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe event batch does not contain actionable indicators of malicious activity. The activities are consistent with normal system operations, including script execution, .NET framework interactions, and temporary file management. **No further investigation is warranted based on the provided data.**\n\n**Verdict:** **Not Interesting for Investigation** (No suspicious activity detected)."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several entries where PowerShell is loading images, like mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, and mscoree.dll. These are all legitimate .NET framework files, so that's probably normal. But then I see some file creation events. For example, they're creating files in the Temp directory and other locations with names like \"objeto_principal_script.bat\" and \"componente_comum_script.bat\". \n\nWait, the command lines show that PowerShell is creating new items and setting content to these batch files. The content is \"dir\", which is a simple command, but the paths are a bit suspicious. They have a lot of backslashes and dots, which might be obfuscation. Like, \"C:\\\\registro_geral\\\\componente_ativo\\\\..\\\\componente_geral\\\\elemento_ativo_script.bat\" – the \"..\\\\\" part suggests they're navigating up a directory, which might be trying to hide the actual path or make it look less obvious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of PowerShell creating files and checking if certain scripts exist. The exit codes based on Test-Path might be part of a larger script that's checking for the presence of files, maybe as part of a setup or a payload delivery. The fact that they're creating batch files in various locations could be a way to execute commands later, especially if those files are being written with malicious content.\n\nAnother thing is the use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. Those might be related to PowerShell's internal operations, but combined with the file creation, it could indicate something more. However, I need to check if these are normal activities. Creating temporary files is common, but the pattern here seems repetitive and possibly automated.\n\nLooking at the files created, some are in the Temp directory, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files. The names of the files are generic, which might be an attempt to avoid detection. Also, the fact that multiple files are being created with similar naming patterns could be a red flag.\n\nBut I should also consider that some of these might be part of legitimate software operations. For example, .NET applications often load those DLLs. However, the combination of creating multiple batch files and the obfuscated paths might be suspicious. Additionally, the repeated use of Test-Path in different locations could be checking for the existence of files that are part of a larger attack chain, like checking if a payload has been delivered or if certain conditions are met before executing.\n\nI should also check if there are any anomalies in the process creation or access. There's an event where PowerShell is accessed, but that's a normal part of its operation. The image loading events are standard for .NET applications. However, the frequency and the specific paths of the created files might be unusual.\n\nIn summary, while some of these activities are normal for PowerShell, the pattern of creating multiple batch files in various locations with obfuscated paths, combined with the Test-Path checks, could indicate a potential security threat. It's not conclusive without more context, but the suspicious file creation and paths warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **suspicious behavior** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Findings:**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation with Obfuscated Paths**:\n   - PowerShell creates multiple batch files (`*.bat`) in non-standard locations (e.g., `C:\\registro_geral\\componente_ativo\\..\\componente_geral\\elemento_ativo_script.bat`) using paths with `..\\` segments. This obfuscation may aim to hide the actual target directory or evade detection.\n   - Example command:  \n     ```powershell\n     New-Item -Path \"C:\\registro_geral\\componente_ativo\\..\\componente_geral\\elemento_ativo_script.bat\" -ItemType File\n     ```\n\n2. **Suspicious Script Content**:\n   - Files are written with simple commands like `dir`, but their creation in multiple locations and obfuscated paths raises concerns. This could be a precursor to executing malicious payloads or establishing persistence.\n\n3. **Frequent `Test-Path` Checks**:\n   - PowerShell scripts repeatedly check for the existence of files (e.g., `C:\\modulo_secundario\\elemento_padrao\\..\\registro_logico\\estrutura_principal_script.bat`). This behavior may indicate:\n     - **Precondition checks** for a larger attack (e.g., verifying if a payload has been deployed).\n     - **Conditional execution** of commands based on file presence, which is common in malware.\n\n4. **Legitimate vs. Suspicious DLL Loads**:\n   - While loading .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) is normal for PowerShell, the **frequency** and **correlation with file creation** suggest potential misuse (e.g., loading malicious code disguised as legitimate components).\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n- **File Paths**:  \n  - `C:\\registro_geral\\componente_ativo\\..\\componente_geral\\elemento_ativo_script.bat`  \n  - `C:\\modulo_secundario\\elemento_padrao\\..\\registro_logico\\estrutura_principal_script.bat`  \n  - `C:\\entrada_logico\\componente_temporario\\..\\objeto_padrao\\pacote_ativo_script.bat`  \n  *(Obfuscated paths with `..\\` segments are common in evasion techniques.)*\n\n- **Commands**:  \n  - `if (Test-Path \"PATH\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }`  \n  - `New-Item -Path \"PATH\" -ItemType File`  \n  - `Set-Content -Path \"PATH\" -Value \"dir\"`  \n\n---\n\n### **Threat Assessment:**\n- **Likely Malicious Activity**:  \n  The combination of **file creation in non-standard paths**, **obfuscation**, and **conditional checks** strongly suggests **malicious intent** (e.g., initial access, persistence, or command-and-control setup).  \n  - The use of `Test-Path` and `New-Item` could be part of a **payload deployment** or **post-exploitation routine**.\n\n- **Possible Attack Vector**:  \n  - **Script-based malware** (e.g., PowerShell Empire, Cobalt Strike) using obfuscated paths to avoid detection.  \n  - **Living off the land** by abusing legitimate tools (PowerShell) for malicious purposes.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Created Files**:  \n   - Check the contents of the batch files (e.g., `dir` may be a placeholder for more complex commands).  \n   - Monitor for additional file creation or execution in the same directories.\n\n2. **Correlate with Other Logs**:  \n   - Look for **network activity** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs) or **process injections** around the time of these events.\n\n3. **Block or Quarantine Suspicious Processes**:  \n   - If the activity is confirmed malicious, terminate the PowerShell processes and block execution of scripts with obfuscated paths.\n\n4. **Enhance Detection Rules**:  \n   - Add **SIEM rules** to flag repeated `Test-Path` or `New-Item` commands with obfuscated paths.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **highly suspicious** and likely represent **malicious activity**. Immediate investigation is recommended to determine the scope of compromise and mitigate risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell processes. The command lines are similar, using Test-Path to check for specific batch files and exiting with 0 or 1. The paths mentioned are a mix of different directories, some with \"modulo\", \"componente\", \"elemento\", etc. But all these paths seem to be in different locations, not necessarily malicious. However, the fact that there are so many of these PowerShell commands checking for these files might be suspicious. Maybe they're trying to see if certain files exist, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there are entries about image loaded, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. That's normal, so probably not an issue. Also, a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be part of legitimate monitoring. The whoami.exe is just checking the user, which is normal.\n\nLooking at the tasks: most are Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, ImageLoad, ProcessCreate, etc. Some are FileCreated events, like the one in the Temp directory. But creating a file in Temp is common. The StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file might be related to PowerShell profiles, which could be normal or could be used for persistence if modified.\n\nThe Registry value set event might indicate changes to the registry, which could be malicious if unauthorized. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, combined with the multiple PowerShell checks for files, it might be part of an attempt to check for the presence of certain files, possibly to determine if a payload is present or to check for conditions before executing further steps.\n\nBut I also see that some of the paths have \"..\\\" in them, which could be directory traversal attempts. For example, in the first event, the path is \"C:\\\\componente_comum\\\\modulo_temporario\\\\..\\\\unidade_geral\\\\elemento_ativo_script.bat\". The \"..\\\\unidade_geral\" would go up a directory. Maybe they're trying to access files in parent directories, which could be a way to bypass certain restrictions or access files that shouldn't be accessible. That's a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of similar PowerShell commands checking different paths. If an attacker is trying to check for the existence of multiple files, maybe to see if a certain setup is present or to look for vulnerabilities. However, without seeing the actual content of those files, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe presence of multiple FileCreate events, especially in Temp and AppData, could be part of normal operations, but could also be used to store temporary files or scripts. The StartupProfileData file might be related to user profiles, which if modified, could be a way to persist after a reboot.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of PowerShell commands checking for files with directory traversal, along with some file creation events and registry changes, might indicate suspicious activity. However, some of these could be part of legitimate software behavior. But given that the paths are varied and the commands are repetitive, it's worth investigating further. The directory traversal is a strong indicator of potential malicious intent, so this batch might be flagged as interesting for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains **multiple PowerShell commands** that check for the existence of specific files across various directories, some of which include **directory traversal (`..\\\\`)** in their paths. While some entries (e.g., Windows Defender DLLs, `winlogbeat.exe`, `whoami.exe`) are benign, the **repetition of PowerShell `Test-Path` commands** with potentially obfuscated or non-standard paths raises **suspicion**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Indicators of Potential Concern:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell `Test-Path` Commands**  \n   - **Example:**  \n     ```powershell\n     if (Test-Path \"C:\\\\componente_comum\\\\modulo_temporario\\\\..\\\\unidade_geral\\\\elemento_ativo_script.bat\")\n     ```\n   - **Why Suspicious:**  \n     - The use of `..\\\\` (directory traversal) suggests an attempt to access files in parent directories, which could be used to bypass restrictions or access unexpected locations.  \n     - The repetitive nature of these checks (15+ similar commands) may indicate **condition checking** for payloads, persistence mechanisms, or pre-execution verification.\n\n2. **File Creation in Temporary\/Transient Directories**  \n   - **Examples:**  \n     - `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1`  \n     - `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`  \n   - **Why Suspicious:**  \n     - Files in `Temp` or `AppData` are common for **malware staging** or **script execution**.  \n     - The `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` file may indicate **PowerShell profile persistence** (e.g., for post-reboot execution).\n\n3. **Registry Value Set Event**  \n   - **Entry:**  \n     - `Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)`  \n   - **Why Suspicious:**  \n     - Unauthorized registry modifications can be used for **persistence** or **disabling security features**.  \n     - No context is provided, so further investigation is needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity (Non-Suspicious):**\n- **Windows Defender DLLs (`MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`)**: Normal system operations.  \n- **`winlogbeat.exe`**: Log shipping tool (common in monitoring setups).  \n- **`whoami.exe`**: Standard command for user identification.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch is **interesting for further investigation** due to:  \n- **Repetitive PowerShell checks** with directory traversal.  \n- **File creation in transient directories** (potentially for staging or persistence).  \n- **Registry modification** (context needed to confirm legitimacy).  \n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Correlate these events with **file content analysis** (e.g., inspect the created `.ps1` files).  \n- Check for **unauthorized registry changes**.  \n- Monitor for **unusual PowerShell script execution** or **elevation of privileges**.  \n\n**Verdict:** ✅ **Interesting (Flag for Further Analysis)**."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. Most of them are about PowerShell and cmd.exe processes. There are several instances where PowerShell is being accessed or created. Some entries have command lines that check for the existence of certain files, like \"if (Test-Path ...)\" which might be part of a script checking if a file exists. \n\nWait, there's a file created and then deleted: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1\" is created and then deleted. That could be a sign of something temporary, maybe a script that's run and then cleaned up. But why would that be suspicious? Maybe if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nAlso, there are a few instances where the task is \"Image loaded\" with paths to .dll files. Some of these are standard system files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. However, there's also a reference to \"MpOAV.dll\" from Windows Defender. That might be normal, but I should note it.\n\nLooking at the command lines, they all seem to be checking for the existence of specific files. For example, \"Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\pacote_padrao\\\\estrutura_base\\\\src\\\\unidade_secundario.cs\\\"\". These paths look like they might be part of a project structure, but the names are a bit generic. However, multiple checks for different files might indicate that the attacker is probing the system for certain files, maybe looking for existing scripts or trying to determine the environment.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of PowerShell processes. There are multiple \"Process accessed\" and \"Process Create\" events for PowerShell. While PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities, the frequency here might be worth noting. However, without more context, like unusual parameters or network activity, it's hard to say.\n\nThe creation and deletion of the temporary file might be a red flag. Sometimes malware creates temporary files to execute scripts and then deletes them to avoid leaving evidence. But again, this could be part of a legitimate process, like a script that generates a temporary file for testing.\n\nI also notice entries with \"Registry value set\" but no specific details. That's a bit vague. Without more info on what registry key was modified, it's hard to assess the risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The logs show normal system activities like process creation, file checks, and temporary file handling. However, the repeated checks for specific files and the temporary file creation\/deletion could indicate probing or potential malicious activity. But since there's no direct evidence of malicious code execution, network traffic, or other suspicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut the user is asking if it's interesting for investigation. Considering that the events are mostly routine but have some elements that could be part of an attack (like temporary files and file existence checks), it might be worth looking into further. However, without more data, it's hard to confirm. Maybe the answer is INTERESTING because the combination of these events could be indicative of something more, even if not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of routine system activities and potentially suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple entries involve `PowerShell.exe` with `Test-Path` commands checking for specific files (e.g., `unidade_secundario.cs`, `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`). While these could be legitimate (e.g., script validation), the repetitive nature and non-standard file paths (e.g., `C:\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\...`) raise concerns about probing or reconnaissance.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This pattern is common in malware to avoid leaving evidence but could also be part of a legitimate process (e.g., policy testing). However, the filename and lack of context make it suspicious.\n\n3. **Registry and DLL Load Events:**\n   - Entries involving `Registry value set` and loading system DLLs (e.g., `MpOAV.dll` from Windows Defender) are generally benign. However, without additional context (e.g., unexpected registry changes or non-standard DLLs), these are inconclusive.\n\n4. **Lack of Direct Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No clear evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or anomalous command-line arguments (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `DownloadString`) is present. The logs focus on file existence checks and temporary file handling.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the logs do not definitively indicate malicious activity, the combination of **frequent PowerShell usage**, **file existence checks**, and **temporary file creation\/deletion** suggests **potential reconnaissance or early-stage attack behavior**. These patterns are **suspicious enough to merit further investigation**, especially if correlated with other telemetry (e.g., network traffic, user behavior, or additional log sources).\n\n**Classification:** `INTERESTING`  \n**Reason:** The logs exhibit behaviors consistent with both legitimate and malicious activity, requiring deeper analysis to rule out threats."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through the events to spot any anomalies or suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first event: there's a PowerShell process checking if a specific script, Get-Keystrokes.ps1, exists in a directory. The command line uses Test-Path and exits based on whether the file is present. That's a bit odd because why would a script check for another script's existence and exit? Maybe it's part of a larger process, but it's a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of PowerShell processes being accessed, and several image loads related to .NET components like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are standard for .NET applications, so maybe not suspicious on their own. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so maybe the system is scanning something, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. The name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be related to PowerShell execution policies, but the temporary file could be a sign of something trying to bypass security measures.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of PowerShell processes with the same command line structure, checking different paths for Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The paths vary, like C:\\registro_base..., C:\\tarefa_temporario..., and C:\\unidade_logico... Each time, the script checks if the file exists and exits. This repetition across different directories might indicate an attempt to locate a keystroke logging script, which is a common tactic in malware to capture sensitive information.\n\nAlso, there's activity with winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so this might be part of normal operations, but the repetition of file creation events could be worth checking if it's legitimate.\n\nChrome and svchost.exe have network connections and DNS queries, which are normal for browsing, but without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious. However, the focus here seems to be on PowerShell activities.\n\nPutting this all together: the repeated PowerShell checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various directories, combined with the temporary file creation and deletion, suggest potential malicious behavior. The presence of multiple instances checking for the same script across different paths might be an attempt to execute or locate a keystlogging tool. Even though some components are standard, the overall pattern points towards suspicious activity that merits further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential malicious activity:\n\n### Key Indicators of Concern:\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Script Checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes repeatedly check for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in different directories (e.g., `C:\\registro_base...`, `C:\\tarefa_temporario...`, `C:\\unidade_logico...`). \n   - **Why this matters**: The script name `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is commonly associated with **malware** designed to capture keystrokes (e.g., for stealing passwords or sensitive data). Repeated checks across multiple directories suggest an attempt to locate or execute this script, possibly to evade detection.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Immediate Deletion**:\n   - A file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1` is created in the Temp directory and then deleted. \n   - **Why this matters**: This behavior is often seen in **malware** or **exploits** that attempt to execute scripts in memory (e.g., via PowerShell) to avoid leaving persistent traces on the filesystem.\n\n3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Frequent `ProcessAccess` events for `powershell.exe` (10+ entries) and the use of `.NET` components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) could indicate **script obfuscation** or **payload execution**. While `.NET` components are legitimate, their combination with the above behaviors raises suspicion.\n\n4. **Potential Antivirus Interference**:\n   - The presence of `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender) in the list of loaded modules suggests the system may be actively scanning for threats. However, this does not rule out the possibility of **malware evading detection**.\n\n---\n\n### Contextual Considerations:\n- **Legitimate Use Cases**: \n  - `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` could theoretically be a **legitimate script** (e.g., for testing or monitoring). However, the **repetition across directories** and **temporary file behavior** strongly lean toward malicious intent.\n  - The `winlogbeat.exe` activity (file creation) is likely **benign** if part of a configured log-shipping process, but should be cross-checked with system baselines.\n\n- **Network Activity**: \n  - Chrome and `svchost.exe` network\/DNS activity is **normal for browsing**, but without additional context (e.g., destination IPs, domains), it is hard to assess risk.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation:\nThis batch of logs **merits further investigation** due to the **unusual PowerShell behavior** and **suspicious script checks**. Steps to take:\n1. **Check for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`** in the directories mentioned.\n2. **Analyze the contents of the deleted temporary file** (if possible via memory dumps or logs).\n3. **Monitor PowerShell execution policies** and check for **unauthorized script execution**.\n4. **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., process creation, registry changes) to determine if this is part of a larger attack.\n\n**Conclusion**: **Interesting for investigation**—the patterns align with known malicious tactics, though further analysis is required to confirm intent."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a list of JSON objects, each representing a system event.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: 'whoami.exe' was executed. That's a normal command to get the current user, so probably benign. Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes. PowerShell is common, but the tasks here might indicate something. There's a 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', and multiple 'Image loaded' events. The images loaded are all legitimate system files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET framework, so that's normal.\n\nThen there's a 'Pipe Created' event, which might be normal communication between processes. The command lines show PowerShell commands using 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse', which are just listing files recursively. That's a standard command, but repeated multiple times. However, the same command being logged multiple times could be a sign of something, but maybe it's just a normal operation.\n\nThen there's a 'File created' event for a .txt file and a .yml.new file related to Winlogbeat. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. However, the user might be setting up or modifying the configuration. The 'File created' events might not be suspicious unless they're in unusual locations or by unexpected processes.\n\nLooking at all the events together, most are standard system activities. The PowerShell commands are common, and the loaded DLLs are legitimate. The only thing that stands out is the repetition of the same command multiple times, but that might just be logging the same action several times. There's no evidence of malicious activity like unauthorized access, unexpected network connections, or unusual file modifications. The presence of Winlogbeat files suggests monitoring is in place, which is normal.\n\nSo, I think this batch isn't interesting. The events are all legitimate system processes and normal user activities. No signs of compromise or suspicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent standard system and user activities, including legitimate PowerShell operations, .NET framework image loading, and file creation by Winlogbeat (a log shipper). No suspicious patterns, unauthorized access, or malicious behavior are detected.\"\n}"}
