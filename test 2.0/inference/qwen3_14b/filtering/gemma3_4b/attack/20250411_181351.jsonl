Hmm, there are a bunch of PowerShell.exe processes being accessed and created. The first few entries show ProcessAccess and ProcessCreate events for PowerShell and whoami.exe. Then there's a whoami.exe command line which is just the standard path, so maybe that's normal.\n\nWait, but then there's a PowerShell command line that's doing some image stuff. It's using System.Windows.Forms to capture the screen and save it as a PNG in the Temp directory. That seems suspicious because capturing the screen could be part of a malicious activity, like taking screenshots for data exfiltration. Also, there are multiple instances of this command line with different filenames, which might indicate automated or repeated actions.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll.

The repeated use of PowerShell for these tasks, especially with screen capture, raises a red flag. \n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple events with the same command line but different filenames suggests that the attacker might be trying to take multiple screenshots, possibly to gather information from the user's desktop. Since PowerShell is often used in attacks, and the combination of process access, registry changes, and image loading could indicate an attempt to persist or escalate privileges. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any indication of malicious activity beyond just the commands. The whoami.exe is a legitimate tool, but the PowerShell scripts are doing unusual things. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events for system DLLs might be normal, but when paired with the screenshot commands, it's more concerning. \n\nOverall, the repeated PowerShell activities, especially the screen capture, make this batch interesting for investigation.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the JSON entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several PowerShell commands. The command lines involve using Add-Type with System.Windows.Forms, then capturing the screen and saving it as a PNG in the Temp directory. That seems odd. Why would someone take screenshots multiple times and save them in temp? Maybe they're trying to exfiltrate data or map the screen for some malicious purpose.\n\nThere are multiple instances of the same PowerShell command, each time saving a different image. That repetition could be a red flag. Also, the filenames are varied, but the method is consistent. Taking screenshots via PowerShell isn't normal unless it's part of a legitimate tool, but doing it multiple times might be suspicious.\n\nOther events include file creation and deletion, like the __PSScriptPolicyTest file. That might be related to script execution policies being tested, which isn't necessarily bad, but combined with the screenshot commands, it could indicate something more. There's also a file created by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper, but that's probably normal.\n\nRegistry events and pipe creations are there too, but those are common in normal operations. However, the repeated PowerShell activities with screen captures stand out. The fact that the screenshots are saved in the Temp directory might be an attempt to hide them temporarily before exfiltration. Also, the use of $env:TEMP suggests the attacker is trying to leave no trace.\n\nI should check if there's any other malicious activity. The other processes like chrome.exe and conhost.exe don't seem to have suspicious commands. The only thing that's repeated multiple times is the PowerShell screenshot code. That's probably the key here.\n\nSo, the classification would be INTERESTING because the multiple PowerShell commands taking screenshots and saving them in temp could be part of a larger malicious activity, like data exfiltration or reconnaissance. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these specific PowerShell commands repeated several times is suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing commands to capture screenshots of the virtual screen and save them as PNG files in the TEMP directory. This behavior is highly suspicious as it may indicate screen scraping for data exfiltration, reconnaissance, or malicious automation.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of JSONL events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a concise justification.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each event is about. Let's go through them one by one. All the events have the process name as 'chrome.exe', which is normal since Chrome is a common browser. The winlog tasks vary. Most of them are 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)', which might be normal behavior, but I should check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nLooking at the file paths, most of them are 'None', which means no file path is associated with those events. However, there are two events with 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)' tasks. The first one has the file path 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll'. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. Loading this file from the System32 directory seems legitimate because that's where system files are stored. But maybe there's something else here.\n\nThe second ImageLoad event points to 'C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll'. MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender's real-time protection. Again, this is a legitimate file. However, the fact that chrome.exe is loading these DLLs might be unusual. Chrome typically doesn't need to load Windows Defender components directly. But maybe it's part of some integration or extension?\n\nNow, considering the repetition of Registry value set events. If this is a normal user activity, maybe Chrome is updating some settings, but if it's part of a malicious activity, like changing registry keys to persist or modify system behavior, that could be a red flag. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. But the presence of multiple RegistryEvent tasks might indicate some level of activity that's worth investigating.\n\nThe key points here are the ImageLoad events. Even though the DLLs are legitimate, the fact that Chrome is loading them might be out of the ordinary. However, there's no indication of malicious activity in the provided data. The events don't show any unusual network activity, file modifications, or other suspicious tasks. The Dns query event is also normal for a browser.\n\nSo, putting it all together. The events are mostly normal Chrome activities, but the loading of Windows Defender DLLs by Chrome could be something to look into. However, since there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior, the classification might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" unless there's more context. But wait, the justification needs to be concise. The presence of ImageLoad events with legitimate DLLs might not be suspicious on their own. The repeated Registry events might not be enough to classify as interesting without more context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that all events are from chrome.exe and involve registry changes and loading DLLs could be a sign of something. However, Chrome does interact with the registry for its own settings. Without seeing the actual registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. So, perhaps the batch isn't interesting enough to warrant an investigation unless there's more data. Therefore, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity, even though some events are unusual, they could be part of normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate Chrome.exe activity with no clear indicators of compromise. The loaded DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) are legitimate Windows Defender components, and registry modifications are consistent with normal browser behavior.\"\n}"}
