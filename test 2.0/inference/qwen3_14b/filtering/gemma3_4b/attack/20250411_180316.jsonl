The 'Registry value set' events are common, but maybe not suspicious on their own. However, looking at the 'Image loaded' events, I notice that 'urlmon.dll' is being loaded multiple times. That's a system file, so loading it from the System32 directory might be normal. But wait, there's also 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender's directory being loaded by WMIC.exe. That seems odd because WMIC is a legitimate tool, but loading Defender's DLL might be a red flag.\n\nThen there's the 'cmd.exe' command line that deletes 'notepad.exe' processes using wmic.

The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, Process Create, and Image loaded. \n\nHmm, the majority of the events are from chrome.exe and powershell.exe doing registry modifications and process access. But wait, some of the cmd.exe commands stand out. For example, there's a command that copies sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. That rings a bell because sethc.exe is the Sticky Keys executable. Replacing it with a backup file could be part of a malicious activity, like a backdoor or something. \n\nAnother cmd.exe event uses schtasks to delete a task named win32times. Deleting a task might be suspicious if it's part of an attempt to remove something the attacker doesn't want detected. Also, there's a schtasks.exe process creating a task, which could be related to scheduling malicious activities. \n\nThe whoami.exe commands are pretty normal; they just show the current user, so that's probably not a big deal. The svchost.exe modifying the registry might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be part of something else. \n\nThe Image loaded event for taskschd.dll seems normal since that's a legitimate Windows file. However, the combination of multiple registry changes, process creations, and the specific cmd commands might indicate an attempt to modify system files or schedule tasks. \n\nSo putting it all together, the presence of commands that modify system files (like replacing sethc.exe) and using schtasks to delete or create tasks could be signs of malicious activity.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: cmd.exe setting a registry value. That's common, but not necessarily bad. Then chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. Loading those might be normal, but sometimes attackers can replace these files. However, the paths here look legitimate. \n\nNext, there are multiple entries of cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe modifying registry values. That's a lot of registry changes. Maybe a script is running, but not sure yet. Then, whoami.exe is executed, which is just getting user info. Not suspicious on its own. \n\nLooking at the powershell.exe entries: several 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events. Also, image loaded events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are normal for PowerShell running scripts. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. The name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be part of a legitimate test, but sometimes attackers use similar names to hide malicious scripts. \n\nWait, the file is in the Temp folder, which is common for temporary files, but creating a script there could be a red flag. However, without seeing the content of the script, it's hard to tell. The presence of multiple PowerShell events, registry changes, and the temp file might indicate some automated process or testing. But could also be part of an attack. \n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple instances of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent for PowerShell and cmd.exe might suggest someone is trying to manipulate the system. However, without more context, like unusual command lines or unexpected network activity, it's a bit hard to say. \n\nThe key points here are the number of events related to PowerShell and registry modifications, along with the temp file creation. While some of these are normal, the combination might be worth investigating. The temp file's name is a bit generic, but not obviously malicious. However, the sheer volume of events and the use of PowerShell for creating a script could be indicative of something more. \n\nSo, I think this batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event shows a file deletion in the Temp directory by powershell.exe. That might be normal, but then there are multiple entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks, all involving powershell.exe with command_line as \"& {}\". Those seem suspicious because they might be placeholders or empty commands, possibly indicating some kind of obfuscation or testing.\n\nThen there's a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper, so that's probably legitimate. Another event shows a pipe created by powershell.exe, which could be normal, but the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events make me think. The image loaded event points to a Defender DLL, which is normal. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several PowerShell scripts checking for the existence of files in various paths. The paths have some odd names with \"elemento_geral\", \"modulo_geral\", etc., which might be obfuscated or part of a malicious script. The fact that there are so many similar commands checking different paths could indicate a script trying to locate a file, possibly for execution or data exfiltration.\n\nHowever, none of the events directly indicate a successful attack or malicious activity. They might be part of normal operations, like testing or logging. But the high number of PowerShell events, especially with those specific command lines, raises a red flag.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. The first event shows a PowerShell script checking if a certain file exists and exiting with 0 or 1. That's a common script technique, maybe part of a normal process. But then there are multiple Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. Loading these DLLs is normal for PowerShell when running scripts, but the sheer number might be worth noting.\n\nThen there's a File Created and then immediately File Delete event for a temporary script file. That could be part of a normal operation, like creating a script and then deleting it after use. But sometimes, attackers create and delete files quickly to avoid detection. However, the fact that it's a temporary file and then deleted might be benign.\n\nAnother thing is the Pipe Created event. Pipes are used for inter-process communication. If there's a lot of pipe activity, that might be suspicious, but just one event isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThen there are several Registry value set events from Chrome.exe. Multiple registry changes could indicate something, but Chrome might be updating its own settings. However, the repetition of the same event multiple times (10 times) might be unusual. Maybe Chrome is being manipulated or there's a script changing registry keys repeatedly.\n\nThe other PowerShell events are similar to the first one, checking paths and exiting. The command lines have different paths each time, but they all seem to be checking for the existence of certain batch files. This might be part of a legitimate script that's running checks, but if these paths are in unusual locations or if the scripts are doing more than just checking paths, that could be a red flag.\n\nAlso, the presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded might be normal, but if the system is being monitored, maybe there's an attempt to bypass Defender. However, the events don't show any signs of that directly.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch has a lot of PowerShell activity, which is common but can be a vector for attacks. The repeated registry changes by Chrome might be a sign of something, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The creation and deletion of temporary files is common, but the multiple Image Loads and Process Access events might indicate something more. However, none of the events clearly point to a malicious activity like downloading payloads, executing suspicious commands, or network activity. So, while there are some suspicious elements, they might not be conclusive. The answer would depend on whether the system is known to have benign scripts that do these things. Without more context, it's a bit ambiguous, but the presence of multiple PowerShell checks and registry changes could be worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits a mix of **normal system behavior** and **potentially suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **PowerShell Scripting Activity**:\n   - **Repetitive Path Checks**: Multiple PowerShell commands (e.g., `Test-Path` with varying paths like `modulo_ativo`, `modulo_logico`, etc.) are executed. These scripts exit with `0` or `1` based on file existence. While this could be part of **legitimate automation**, the repeated use of similar patterns across different paths may indicate **script-based workflows** or **tampering**.\n   - **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion**: A temporary script file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and deleted. This is common in PowerShell but could also be a **tactic to evade detection** if files are created\/destroyed rapidly.\n\n2. **DLL Loading**:\n   - **.NET and Defender DLLs**: PowerShell loads several **Windows Defender DLLs** (e.g., `MpClient.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) and **.NET runtime components** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`). While normal for PowerShell execution, **excessive or unusual loading of security-related DLLs** might hint at **attempts to interact with or bypass antivirus**.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - **Chrome.exe Registry Edits**: Ten consecutive `Registry value set` events from **Chrome.exe** are logged. This could indicate **legitimate Chrome updates** or **unauthorized modifications**. The repetition raises flags, as **unusual registry activity** is often linked to **malware persistence** or **configuration tampering**.\n\n4. **Pipe Creation**:\n   - A single **Pipe Created** event is logged. Pipes are normal for inter-process communication, but in isolation, they are not inherently suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment**\n- **Low to Medium Risk**: The events do not directly indicate **malware execution, network exfiltration, or privilege escalation**. However, the **combination of PowerShell scripting, repeated registry changes, and temporary file manipulation** could be **early indicators of a more complex attack** (e.g., **script-based reconnaissance** or **preparation for lateral movement**).\n- **Context Matters**: If the system is known to have **benign automation scripts** or **active development workflows**, some activity may be legitimate. However, the **lack of clear purpose** for the repeated PowerShell checks and Chrome registry edits suggests **further scrutiny is needed**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**: Check for **network activity**, **user behavior**, or **unusual process spawning** around the same timeframe.\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**: Deobfuscate and inspect the scripts (e.g., `modulo_ativo`, `modulo_logico` paths) for **hidden commands** or **external payloads**.\n3. **Monitor Chrome Behavior**: Investigate why Chrome is making **repeated registry changes** (e.g., check for **extensions, policies, or compromised binaries**).\n4. **Check for Anomalies in Defender Logs**: Verify if Windows Defender is **interacting unexpectedly** with the processes (e.g., **real-time protection alerts** or **false positives**).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile no **direct malicious activity** is confirmed, the **combination of PowerShell scripting, repeated registry edits, and temporary file manipulation** raises **sufficient red flags** to warrant a **closer investigation**. This could be **legitimate system behavior** or **early-stage attack activity** depending on context. **Further analysis** is recommended. \n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation** (medium risk)."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines representing system events. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with the process name 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The winlog tasks include things like 'Registry value set', 'Process Create', 'Process accessed', 'Image loaded', and 'File created'. \n\nLooking closer, there's an event where the command line shows PowerShell creating a new item and setting content in a file. The command line has a pattern: New-Item with a path that includes multiple directories, then Set-Content with \"dir\" as the value. This seems like it's creating batch files with the 'dir' command. But why so many of them? The paths are all over the place, which might be an attempt to obfuscate or spread out the malicious activity.\n\nThen there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .dll files, some related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal, but the repetition might be significant. However, the key thing here is the PowerShell activities. The fact that multiple files are being created with 'dir' could be a red flag. Normally, 'dir' is a basic command, but if an attacker is using PowerShell to create scripts that execute such commands, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nAlso, the 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks might be related to PowerShell's own processes, but combined with the file creation and registry changes, it could indicate something malicious. The user is creating a lot of files in different directories, which might be trying to establish persistence or execute commands in various parts of the system.\n\nAnother point is that even though some of these events are normal, the frequency and the specific commands used (like creating files with 'dir') might not be typical. The justification for classification would hinge on whether these activities are out of the ordinary. Since the user hasn't provided context about the environment, I have to assume that such activities are suspicious. \n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple PowerShell activities creating files, registry changes, and image loads. The repeated use of 'dir' in the created files might be a sign of malicious intent, even if it's not obviously harmful. Therefore, this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system event logs exhibit several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential malicious activity. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Indicators of Concern:\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Scripting**:\n   - **File Creation**: Multiple entries show PowerShell creating files with paths like `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1` and other obscure directories. The `Set-Content` command writes `\"dir\"` into these files, which is a basic command-line utility. While innocuous on its own, the **repetition** and **obscure paths** raise concerns about obfuscation or persistence mechanisms.\n   - **Directory Traversal**: The `New-Item` commands use complex, nested directory paths (e.g., `C:\\elemento_geral\\elemento_auxiliar\\..`), which may indicate an attempt to evade detection by spreading activity across multiple locations.\n\n2. **Registry and Process Manipulation**:\n   - Events like **\"Registry value set\"** and **\"File created\"** suggest modifications to system state, potentially for persistence or privilege escalation.\n   - **\"Process accessed\"** and **\"Image loaded\"** events involving `.dll` files (e.g., .NET Framework, Windows Defender) could be benign, but the **volume** and **specificity** of these logs may indicate tampering or injection attacks.\n\n3. **Lack of Clear Purpose**:\n   - The repeated use of `\"dir\"` in created files and the lack of clear, legitimate context for these operations (e.g., no visible user interaction or application-specific justification) could signal **script-based attacks** or **malware droppers**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs contain **multiple suspicious activities** (repetitive PowerShell scripting, file creation in non-standard locations, and registry\/process manipulation) that are **not clearly tied to legitimate system behavior**. While not definitively malicious, these patterns **strongly suggest the need for further investigation**, including:\n- Analyzing the contents of created files (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`).\n- Checking for unauthorized registry changes or process injection.\n- Monitoring user accounts (e.g., `fiddelis`) for anomalous activity.\n\n**Classification**: **Interesting for investigation** — the events are not conclusively malicious but exhibit behaviors commonly associated with adversarial activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user mentioned looking at the entire batch as a whole, so I can't just check each event individually. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. Most of them are 'powershell.exe', which is common but can be a vector for attacks. There's also 'conhost.exe', which is part of Windows and usually not suspicious on its own.\n\nNow, the winlog tasks. There's 'File Delete logged', 'Pipe Created', 'Engine Lifecycle', 'Image loaded', 'File created', 'Registry value set', and 'Process Create' and 'Process accessed'. Some of these are normal, but others might be more suspicious. For example, 'File Delete logged' could be part of normal operations, but if it's deleting temporary files, maybe not. However, the 'Pipe Created' event might be less common and could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the files involved. The first event mentions a file in the Temp directory being deleted. That's a common place for temporary files, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's a 'File created' event with a .bat file in 'C:\\\\componente_geral\\\\estrutura_comum\\\\objeto_comum_script.bat'. Creating a batch file might be normal, but if it's part of a sequence of events that seem to be setting up something malicious, that could be a problem.\n\nAnother thing to note is the command lines. Some of the PowerShell commands are using 'New-Item' to create files and 'Set-Content' to write content. For example, one command creates a file and sets its content to 'dir', which is a basic command. That might be benign, but if there are multiple such files created in different directories, it might be part of a larger operation.\n\nThere are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .dll files. Some of these are from Microsoft, like 'MpClient.dll' from Windows Defender, which is expected. Others like 'mscoree.dll' and 'clr.dll' are part of the .NET framework, so they're normal. But if there were unexpected DLLs, that would be a concern. However, in this case, they all seem legitimate.\n\nThe 'Provider Lifecycle' events have PowerShell commands that check if certain files exist. These are simple existence checks, which might be part of a script that's checking prerequisites or ensuring files are in place. But if these files are being created or modified in ways that aren't standard, that could be an issue.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there's a lot of file creation and checking for existence, which could be part of a legitimate script. However, the repetition of similar commands across different directories might indicate an automated process. The presence of multiple 'File created' events with .bat files might be a sign of something more, especially if those scripts are being executed later. But without seeing the actual content of the .bat files or more context on the execution, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nAnother point is the use of 'Provider Lifecycle' events. These are related to PowerShell providers, which are used to interact with different data stores. While normal, excessive use could be a sign of something trying to access or manipulate data in non-standard ways.\n\nPutting this all together, the events don't show clear signs of a security threat like malware or unauthorized access. However, the combination of multiple file operations, registry changes, and PowerShell activity could be part of a larger process that's either legitimate or potentially malicious. Since the user is asking for an investigation, the fact that there are several events that are not typical for normal user activity might warrant further examination. But based solely on the given information, it's not conclusive enough to label it as suspicious. Maybe the answer is that it's not clearly malicious, but there are enough anomalies to consider further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries involve a series of **PowerShell** and **Windows** system activities, primarily centered around **file operations**, **registry changes**, and **.NET framework** interactions. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**:\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **File Creation\/Modification**: Multiple entries show PowerShell scripts creating `.bat` files (e.g., `objeto_comum_script.bat`) and writing content (e.g., `dir`). These files are created in non-standard, deeply nested directories (e.g., `C:\\componente_geral\\estrutura_comum\\...`), which could indicate an attempt to obscure the purpose of the files.\n   - **Existence Checks**: Scripts frequently check for the existence of files (e.g., `Test-Path`) across various directories. While this is common in automation, the repetition and use of arbitrary paths may hint at a **custom or obfuscated workflow**.\n\n2. **System-Level Events**:\n   - **File Deletion**: A temporary file (`..._script.bat`) is deleted from the `Temp` directory. This is typical for cleanup operations but could also be part of a **malicious payload** to remove evidence.\n   - **Image Loads**: Multiple `.dll` files (e.g., `MpClient.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) are loaded. These are legitimate components of Windows and .NET, so no immediate threat is indicated.\n\n3. **Registry and Pipe Operations**:\n   - **Registry Changes**: Events like `Registry value set` are present but lack context (e.g., no specific keys or values). This could be part of **legitimate configuration changes** or **malicious persistence mechanisms**.\n   - **Pipe Creation**: A `Pipe Created` event is logged. While rare, this could indicate **inter-process communication (IPC)**, which is normal in some applications but may be exploited in attacks.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Red Flags**:\n- **Unusual File Paths**: The deeply nested and non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_secundario\\elemento_padrao\\...`) may be an attempt to evade detection.\n- **Repetition of Patterns**: The repeated use of `Test-Path` and file creation across different directories suggests a **scripted or automated process**, which could be benign or malicious.\n- **Lack of Context**: No clear indication of user intent (e.g., no error logs, no user interaction) makes it difficult to assess whether these activities are part of a **legitimate workflow** or a **hidden attack**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe events **do not conclusively indicate a security threat** (e.g., malware, unauthorized access). However, the **combination of file operations, registry changes, and PowerShell activity** raises **sufficient ambiguity** to warrant further investigation. Key next steps would include:\n- **Analyzing the content of the `.bat` files** to determine their purpose.\n- **Correlating these events with user behavior or system context** (e.g., were these files created during a legitimate task?).\n- **Checking for additional logs** (e.g., process creation, network activity) to identify potential lateral movement or exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Verdict**:\n**Unclear** (Not definitively malicious, but **suspicious enough to require deeper analysis**)."}

That might be a red flag because PowerShell scripts checking for the existence of files could be part of an attack, like trying to see if certain malicious files are present.\n\nThen there are some events related to file creation and deletion. For example, a temporary PowerShell script is created and then deleted. That's common in normal operations, but when combined with other activities, it might be part of something more sinister. Also, there's a mention of winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. The file creation there might be normal, but I need to check if it's related to the other events.\n\nLooking at the tasks, most are related to process creation, image loading, and file operations. The PowerShell processes are frequent, and the command lines are similar. They all use Test-Path to check for specific .bat files.

The key point is that the batch shows multiple PowerShell processes checking for the existence of various .bat files across different paths. This pattern could be indicative of an attacker probing the system for specific files, which is suspicious behavior.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe is running a command that checks if a specific file exists. The command line uses Test-Path and exits 0 or 1 based on that. That's a common script, maybe checking for a file's presence. Not immediately suspicious, but maybe part of a larger process.\n\nThen there are several entries about Image Load events. PowerShell is loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and some from the .NET framework. That's normal because PowerShell uses .NET, so loading these DLLs is expected. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so that's normal too. No red flags here yet.\n\nNext, there's a File Create and then a File Delete event for a temporary script file. Creating and deleting a temp file is common in scripts, especially for PowerShell. But the fact that it's creating a script file and then deleting it might be a tactic to avoid leaving traces. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nThere are also multiple Process Access events and Registry value set events. Process Access could be normal, but if it's accessing other processes, that might be worth checking. The Registry changes could be part of configuration changes, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, the PowerShell scripts are checking for the existence of certain files. The paths mentioned are like C:\\registro_ativo\\... and others. These paths don't look standard. Maybe they're trying to access files in non-standard directories, which could be part of an attack. For example, if the script is checking for a file in a directory that's not typical, that might indicate something is trying to locate a payload or check for a specific condition.\n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe process, which is just a normal command to get user info. Not suspicious. Then a cmd.exe process checking if a temp file exists. That's similar to the PowerShell checks. Maybe part of a batch of scripts checking for files in various locations.\n\nPutting it all together: The main thing here is the repeated use of PowerShell to check for files in non-standard paths. While checking file existence is normal, doing it multiple times and in different directories might be part of an attack strategy. However, without seeing the actual content of the files or more actions like downloading or executing payloads, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. The presence of Windows Defender DLLs suggests that the system is active in terms of security, but that doesn't rule out an attack.\n\nI think the key points are the multiple file existence checks in non-standard directories and the creation\/deletion of temporary scripts. These could be indicators of reconnaissance or preparation for further actions. However, without more evidence, it's a bit ambiguous. The logs don't show any obvious malicious activity, but the pattern might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system behavior and potentially suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activity**\n1. **Standard DLL Loading**: PowerShell loading `.NET` framework DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) and Windows Defender components (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) is expected during execution.\n2. **Temporary File Operations**: Temporary script creation and deletion (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`, `objeto_logico.txt`) are common in legitimate scripting workflows.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns**\n1. **Repetitive File Existence Checks**:\n   - PowerShell scripts repeatedly check for files in non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_ativo\\...`, `C:\\entrada_auxiliar.exe`). While checking file existence is normal, **repeated checks across multiple directories** may indicate:\n     - **Reconnaissance** for payloads or conditions (e.g., checking for a \"staged\" file before execution).\n     - **Obfuscation** to avoid detection (e.g., probing for hidden files).\n\n2. **Unusual File Paths**:\n   - Paths like `C:\\registro_ativo`, `C:\\componente_principal`, and `C:\\entrada_auxiliar` are not standard system directories. This could suggest **custom or non-legitimate file structures** used to evade detection or host malicious content.\n\n3. **Lack of Clear Purpose**:\n   - The scripts only perform existence checks (`IF EXIST`, `Test-Path`) without further actions (e.g., downloading, modifying files, or executing payloads). While this could be benign, **isolated checks without follow-up** may be a **prelude to lateral movement or data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n- **Unusual PowerShell Usage**: Frequent use of `Test-Path` and file existence checks in non-standard locations.\n- **Non-Standard File Paths**: Files referenced in directories not typically used by legitimate applications.\n- **Lack of Clear Scripting Logic**: No evidence of actual payload execution or data manipulation, which may indicate **incomplete attack chain** or **early-stage reconnaissance**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Additional Logs**:\n   - Check for **file modifications**, **network activity**, or **process execution** following these checks (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`).\n   - Investigate **registry changes** (e.g., `Registry value set` events) for signs of persistence mechanisms.\n\n2. **Analyze File Content**:\n   - If the temporary files (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`, `objeto_logico.txt`) are accessible, inspect their contents for malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Monitor for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Look for **unusual process interactivity** (e.g., `Process accessed` events) or **unauthorized access** to sensitive directories.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs do not definitively indicate malicious activity, the **repetitive file existence checks in non-standard paths** and **lack of clear purpose** for the scripts are **suspicious enough to warrant further investigation**. These patterns could represent **early-stage reconnaissance** or **preparation for a more complex attack**."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the entries are about PowerShell.exe being accessed or created, which is common but can be a red flag if there's a lot of it. Then there's cmd.exe and whoami.exe, which are normal processes. But wait, the whoami.exe commands are just checking the user, which is normal. However, looking at the PowerShell command lines, there's a pattern. The command lines are checking if certain files exist, like \"C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar...\" and others. These paths look like they might be part of some custom or non-standard directories, which could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nAlso, there are several entries where PowerShell is loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. Loading these DLLs is normal for PowerShell, but when combined with the file path checks, it might indicate that the PowerShell process is being used to check for the presence of specific files, possibly as part of a larger attack, like checking if certain payloads or scripts are in place.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of similar commands across different paths. The fact that there are multiple instances of PowerShell checking different directories might suggest that the attacker is trying to locate specific files or directories on the system, which could be part of an installation process or data exfiltration.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these might be legitimate. For example, scripts that check for the existence of files are common in deployment or configuration management. But the combination with the .NET DLLs and the specific paths might be more indicative of a malicious activity. The presence of multiple registry events and process accesses could also be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nBut since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, or executing payloads, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the repeated checks for specific files in non-standard directories and the loading of .NET components might be enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation. The justification would be the unusual file paths and the repeated checks, which could be indicative of a potential security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing commands that check for the existence of files in non-standard, deeply nested directories (e.g., C:\\\\pacote_ativo\\\\estrutura_auxiliar...), which may indicate reconnaissance or setup of malicious payloads.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: PowerShell is loading an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems legitimate because Windows Defender's DLLs are part of the system. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 file. Then, that same file is deleted. That might be part of a script being run temporarily, but why create and delete it? Maybe a red flag.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but not sure yet if that's suspicious. Then several events with \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be normal PowerShell operations, but the command lines check for the existence of certain files, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. Wait, Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which could be malicious. But the events here just check if the file exists and exit 0 or 1. So maybe the actual malicious activity isn't happening here, just checking for the presence of the script.\n\nLooking at the command lines, they all seem to be testing if specific paths exist. The paths are all over the place, like C:\\estrutura_temporario, C:\\tarefa_padrao, etc. These might be obfuscation techniques. Also, the repetition of checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various directories could indicate that the attacker is trying to locate a specific script, perhaps to execute it later. However, in the provided logs, there's no actual execution event, just checks.\n\nThere's also a 'whoami.exe' process created, which is a normal command to get user info. But the repeated PowerShell events checking for these files might be part of a larger attack. However, without events showing the script being executed or malicious actions taken, it's hard to say. The logs don't show any data exfiltration, unusual network activity, or changes to the registry that would be typical of malware.\n\nThe classification here is tricky. On one hand, the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is suspicious. On the other hand, the logs only show checks for the file's existence and not actual execution. The user might be testing their environment or the scripts might be part of a legitimate tool. However, the repeated checks and the use of obfuscated paths could be indicative of an attacker probing the system. But without more context, it's hard to confirm. I think the answer is that it's suspicious but not conclusive. However, since the user is asking for a classification, maybe it's considered interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** Suspicious but inconclusive.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n1. **Legitimate Activity:** Some events (e.g., Windows Defender DLL loading, `whoami.exe` execution) are normal.  \n2. **Suspicious Patterns:**  \n   - Repeated checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in obfuscated paths (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_temporario\\...`) suggest probing for a potentially malicious script.  \n   - Temporary file creation\/deletion (`Temp` directory) could indicate transient malicious activity.  \n   - Lack of direct execution or data exfiltration events makes it unclear if the script is being used maliciously.  \n3. **Context Needed:** The logs show no clear execution of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` or other malicious actions. The behavior could be part of a red team exercise, a false positive, or a precursor to an attack.  \n\n**Recommendation:** Further investigation is warranted, such as monitoring for execution of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`, analyzing network traffic, or checking for unauthorized registry changes."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple Image Load events for PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET Framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll. Those are normal for PowerShell operations, especially if it's using .NET. But then there's a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a bit odd because those are part of antivirus software. Why would PowerShell be loading those? Maybe it's related to some interaction with the antivirus, but not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a File Created event for a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Then immediately a File Delete event for the same file. That could be normal, like a temporary file created and deleted during script execution. But the filenames have \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" in them. Wait, \"Get-Keystrokes\" sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which is a common component in keyloggers. That's suspicious. Even though the file was deleted, the fact that such a script was created and then deleted might indicate malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the command lines for some PowerShell processes. There's a test-path command checking for \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" in different directories. The presence of such a script in the file system, even if it's just a check, might be part of a larger malicious payload. Also, the fact that the script is being tested for existence could be part of a conditional execution, which is often seen in malware to avoid detection.\n\nOther events include normal processes like notepad.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, and their registry or image load events. These don't seem suspicious on their own. However, the repeated ProcessAccess events for PowerShell.exe might indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe key points here are the presence of the \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" script, even though it was deleted, and the multiple ImageLoads of DLLs associated with Windows Defender. Also, the PowerShell commands checking for the existence of that script might be part of a payload that's trying to execute it if it's present. Even if the script isn't found, the fact that the attacker is checking for it could be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is that the user might be trying to hide the script by creating and deleting it quickly. However, the system logs would still capture the creation event. The fact that the script's name is so specific to keystroke logging is a strong indicator of malicious intent.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the combination of the suspicious script name, the creation and deletion of the file, and the PowerShell commands checking for its existence suggests that this batch of events is worth investigating further. It's not conclusive proof of a breach, but it's definitely a sign that something unusual is happening.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **multiple suspicious indicators** that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential malicious activity. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Presence of \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" Script**  \n   - A file named `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is **created and immediately deleted** in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory.  \n   - **Why this is concerning**:  \n     - The name \"Get-Keystrokes\" is strongly associated with **keylogging malware**, which captures user input (e.g., passwords, sensitive data).  \n     - Even though the file was deleted, its creation and deletion in a temporary directory could indicate an attempt to **execute or hide malicious code**.\n\n2. **PowerShell Commands Checking for the Script**  \n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like:  \n     ```powershell\n     Test-Path \"C:\\...\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\"\n     ```  \n   - **Why this is concerning**:  \n     - This suggests the attacker is **checking for the existence of the script** in different directories, possibly to **conditionally execute it** if found.  \n     - Such behavior is common in **malware payloads** designed to avoid detection or adapt to the environment.\n\n3. **Unusual DLL Loads in PowerShell**  \n   - PowerShell loads **Windows Defender-related DLLs** (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) in a non-standard context.  \n   - **Why this is concerning**:  \n     - These DLLs are part of **antivirus\/endpoint protection software**. Their unexpected use in PowerShell could indicate **tampering with security tools** or **malware attempting to bypass detection**.\n\n4. **Repeated ProcessAccess Events for PowerShell**  \n   - Multiple `ProcessAccess` events for `powershell.exe` suggest the process is being **monitored or manipulated**, which could indicate **code injection** or **remote control**.\n\n---\n\n### **Less Suspicious Events**\n- **Standard DLL Loads**:  \n  - PowerShell loading `.NET` DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) is **normal** for script execution.  \n- **Benign Processes**:  \n  - Events related to `notepad.exe`, `calc.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are **routine** and not inherently malicious.  \n- **File Creation by Winlogbeat**:  \n  - The `.yml.new` file created by `winlogbeat.exe` is likely part of **log configuration** and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of events **raises significant red flags** due to:  \n- The **creation\/deletion of a keylogging script**.  \n- **PowerShell probing for malicious scripts**.  \n- **Unusual DLL interactions** with security tools.  \n\n**Recommendations**:  \n1. **Investigate the timeline** around the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` file's creation\/deletion.  \n2. **Analyze PowerShell logs** for further indicators of compromise (e.g., obfuscated scripts, remote connections).  \n3. **Check for persistence mechanisms** (e.g., registry changes, scheduled tasks).  \n4. **Scan the system** for hidden files or processes related to keylogging.  \n\nThis is not definitive proof of a breach, but it **strongly suggests malicious activity** that requires immediate attention."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal, maybe part of an installation or configuration. Then there are several instances of powershell.exe being accessed and creating processes. The whoami.exe is run, which is a standard command to check user identity, so that's probably benign.\n\nBut wait, there's a lot of network activity from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome making multiple network connections and DNS queries could be normal browsing, but svchost.exe usually hosts system services. If it's making a lot of connections, that might be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking closer, there's a powershell.exe process that's loading several DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Loading clr.dll and mscoree.dll is typical for PowerShell, but the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be a red flag. However, Windows Defender's DLLs are legitimate. \n\nThe command line for one powershell.exe instance shows \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\", which are standard commands to list files recursively. That doesn't seem malicious on its own. \n\nThe repeated access to powershell.exe and the loading of multiple DLLs might indicate some kind of scripting or automation. But without seeing any suspicious commands or unexpected network destinations, it's hard to classify this as malicious. The file creation by winlogbeat.exe is part of its normal operation. \n\nOverall, while there are a lot of events, none of them individually or collectively point to clear signs of an attack.

These could be indicators of a script trying to explore the system, maybe looking for files to exfiltrate or modify, or setting up persistence.
