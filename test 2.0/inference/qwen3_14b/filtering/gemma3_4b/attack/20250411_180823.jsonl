{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that might be okay. Notepad modifying the registry could be suspicious, but maybe it's part of legitimate software.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a common admin tool. Not sure yet. The calc.exe entry is interesting because it's loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows file, but sometimes attackers might use it in malicious contexts. However, just loading it might not be enough to flag it yet.\n\nNow, looking at the cmd.exe entries. There's a command line that uses schtasks to create scheduled tasks named things like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The command lines are creating tasks that run calc.exe on logon and startup. That's suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with strange names and triggering calc.exe might be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. Also, the tasks are set to run as the system user, which could be a red flag.\n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe creating a task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same pattern. The fact that multiple tasks are being created with similar naming conventions and using calc.exe could indicate an attempt to establish persistence. Also, the file creation events for tasks in the System32\\Tasks directory might be part of this.\n\nLooking at the svchost.exe entries, they're modifying registry values repeatedly. While svchost is a normal process, excessive registry changes could be indicative of malicious activity, especially if combined with other suspicious events.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of multiple scheduled tasks with unusual names, using calc.exe, and the involvement of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe in creating these tasks are all signs of potential malicious behavior. Even though some processes like chrome.exe and svchost.exe are normal, the combination of these events points towards an attempt to persist on the system, which is a common tactic in malware. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of scheduled tasks with obfuscated names (e.g., 'elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon'), use of cmd.exe\/schtasks.exe to establish persistence mechanisms, and repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe. These patterns are commonly associated with malware persistence techniques.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at the entire batch together, not individual events.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are a lot of entries with 'chrome.exe' performing various tasks like registry value sets, image loaded, and pipe created. Some of these might be normal, but others could be suspicious. For example, the 'Image loaded' events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dllâ€”those are Windows Defender components. Loading them might be normal, but I should check if there's anything unusual about the context.\n\nThen there's 'powershell.exe' involved in several tasks. One event shows a file created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\unidade_ativo.txt'. Creating a file in the Downloads folder isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be. Another 'powershell.exe' event is related to Process accessed, which might indicate someone trying to manipulate or monitor another process.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' event is about a file created in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation. However, the presence of a new .yml file could be a sign of someone setting up logging, which might be benign or part of an investigation.\n\nLooking at the 'whoami.exe' process, which is a standard tool for checking user context. The command line is straightforward, so that's probably normal. However, if there's a lot of 'whoami' calls, that might be suspicious, but here it's just one instance.\n\nNow, considering the frequency of events. There are multiple 'Registry value set' events for 'chrome.exe' and 'powershell.exe'. While registry changes can be normal, excessive or unusual changes might indicate tampering. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Also, the fact that 'chrome.exe' is involved in so many registry changes might be a red flag, especially if it's not typical for Chrome to modify the registry that much.\n\nAnother point is the 'File created' event for 'unidade_ativo.txt'. The filename might be in Portuguese, which could be a clue, but not necessarily malicious. However, combined with other events, it might be part of a larger activity.\n\nI should also check for any patterns that might indicate malicious behavior, like process injection, unexpected network activity, or unauthorized access. But in these logs, the main events are about file creation, registry changes, and process access. There's no mention of network connections or unusual command-line arguments beyond 'whoami.exe'.\n\nThe presence of 'Process accessed' events for 'powershell.exe' and others might indicate that someone is trying to monitor or manipulate processes. However, without more context on the source or destination of the access, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events are normal (like Chrome modifying the registry or PowerShell creating a file), the combination of multiple registry changes, process access events, and the creation of a file in the Downloads directory might be worth investigating. However, since these could also be part of legitimate activities, the classification might be on the edge. But given the number of events and the types of tasks involved, it's leaning towards being interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) 'chrome.exe' repeatedly modifying registry values (unusual for a browser), 2) 'powershell.exe' creating files in user directories, 3) 'Process accessed' events suggesting potential process injection attempts, and 4) 'whoami.exe' execution which may indicate privilege checks. These patterns collectively suggest potential malicious activity warranting further investigation.\"\n}"}
