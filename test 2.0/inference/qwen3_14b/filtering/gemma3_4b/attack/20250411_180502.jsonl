The user mentioned that Chrome and PowerShell are involved. Let me go through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are several entries about Chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's PowerShell.exe with various activities. \n\nLooking at the PowerShell events: there's a Process Create with a command line that starts a script.bat file. The paths here are a bit odd. For example, \"C:\\\\pacote_comum\\\\objeto_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_secundario\\\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\" â€“ the use of \"..\" might indicate trying to access parent directories, which could be a way to obfuscate the path. That's a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .dll files. Some of them are standard .NET files, which is normal. But the Windows Defender MpOAV.dll is loaded. Not sure if that's suspicious yet. \n\nThere's a FileCreated and then immediately FileDelete for a temporary script file. That could be part of normal operations, but sometimes malware creates and deletes files quickly to avoid detection. \n\nAlso, there are several entries where PowerShell is starting processes with scripts in different paths. The paths have a pattern with \"componente_secundario\", \"estrutura_auxiliar\", etc. Maybe these are obfuscated paths, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the repetition of such commands might indicate automated or script-based activities.\n\nThe ApplicationFrameHost.exe has a registry change, but that's less common. However, the main concern here seems to be the PowerShell activities. The combination of creating and deleting files, loading various DLLs, and starting multiple processes with scripts might indicate something malicious. \n\nBut I should check if all these are normal. For example, PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but the frequency and the specific paths might be suspicious. The use of \"..\" in the paths could be an attempt to hide the actual location. Also, the fact that multiple scripts are being executed from different paths might suggest that something is trying to run multiple commands or scripts in a way that's not typical.\n\nConsidering all that, even though some activities are normal, the combination of these events, especially the file creation and deletion, and the multiple process starts with obfuscated paths, might be worth investigating. So the classification should be INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs exhibit a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activities**\n- **Chrome.exe**: DNS queries and network connections are typical for a browser.\n- **PowerShell.exe**: Loading standard .NET DLLs (e.g., `System.Windows.Forms`, `System.Drawing`) is common in legitimate scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Obfuscated Paths in `Start-Process` Commands**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use paths with `..` (e.g., `C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\pacote_secundario\\objeto_padrao_script.bat`). This may indicate **path obfuscation** to evade detection or hide the true location of malicious scripts.\n\n2. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion**:\n   - A temporary script file (`C:\\Users\\...\\wdxgqpwc.143.ps1`) is created and deleted rapidly. This pattern is often used by malware to **avoid leaving traces** on the system.\n\n3. **Frequent Use of `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` Events**:\n   - PowerShell commands are tied to these events, which may indicate **automation or scripting** (e.g., task scheduling, deployment). While not inherently malicious, the frequency and context warrant scrutiny.\n\n4. **Unusual DLL Loading**:\n   - The loading of `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender) is neutral, but combined with other activities, it could signal **endpoint protection bypassing** or **malware interacting with security tools**.\n\n5. **Repetition of Script Execution**:\n   - Multiple `Start-Process` commands execute scripts from different paths, suggesting **automated or batched operations**. This could be part of a **malicious payload delivery** chain.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs show **normal browser and PowerShell activities**, but the **obfuscated paths, file creation\/deletion, and repetitive script execution** raise **red flags**. These patterns are commonly associated with **malware operations** or **suspicious scripting**. Further investigation (e.g., analyzing the scripts, checking for lateral movement, or monitoring system behavior) is recommended.\n\n**Classification**: **INTERESTING** (requires deeper analysis)."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's Calculator.exe and powershell.exe doing registry value sets. Then, powershell.exe has a process accessed and image loaded. One of the image loads is pointing to a Defender DLL, which might be normal, but I need to check if that's expected. Then chrome.exe has a pipe created and multiple registry changes. A lot of chrome.exe entries here. \n\nWait, there's a command line in one of the processes: powershell.exe executing a script from a path that has \"..\\entrada_comum\\componente_padrao_script.bat\". The use of \"..\\\" might indicate trying to access a parent directory, which could be a red flag for path traversal attacks. That seems suspicious.\n\nAnother entry is cmd.exe running a script from \"C:\\entrada_ativo\\estrutura_principal\\entrada_geral_script.bat\". The paths here are a bit unusual, maybe not standard. Also, there's a file created in the user's Downloads folder named \"componente_principal.txt\" via powershell. Creating files in Downloads might not be bad, but combined with other activities, it could be part of something.\n\nLooking at the image loads, chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. But the MpOAV.dll is from Defender's platform, which is also expected. However, the presence of these might be normal, but if there's any unexpected behavior, like loading from unusual paths, that's a problem. But in this case, the paths are standard.\n\nThen there's a file created by svchost.exe in the DeliveryOptimization folder. That seems legitimate as part of Windows' normal operations. \n\nThe recurring registry value sets by chrome.exe and powershell.exe could be part of normal operations, but if they're modifying critical registry keys, that's a concern. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being modified. Without more context, it's hard to tell, but the high number of registry events might indicate something.\n\nThe most suspicious part is the command line with the path traversal. That could be an indicator of an attempt to execute scripts from non-standard locations, possibly trying to bypass security measures. Also, the multiple registry changes and process accesses might be part of a larger attack, like persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events are normal, the presence of the path traversal in the command line and the numerous registry modifications and file creations could indicate malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing scripts with potential path traversal (e.g., '..\\\\entrada_comum\\\\...'), chrome.exe performing numerous registry modifications, and file creation in user directories. The combination suggests potential malicious behavior requiring further investigation.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are seven entries where the process is chrome.exe, and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" with no file information. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, so maybe that's a red flag. But then again, if someone is using chrome to do something unusual, like modifying registry keys, that could be suspicious. However, without more context, like which registry keys are being modified, it's hard to tell. But seven times in a row might be worth looking into.\n\nThen there's the eighth event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file in the downloads directory could be normal if it's part of setup. But the path is in the user's Downloads folder, which might be okay. However, the file is named .winlogbeat.yml.new, which is a temporary file during configuration. That seems normal.\n\nThe ninth event is powershell.exe creating a file called elemento_base.txt in the same Downloads directory. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but creating a text file isn't necessarily malicious. However, if this is part of a larger set of activities, maybe. But alone, it's not suspicious.\n\nNow, combining all events: multiple registry changes by chrome.exe might indicate something, but without knowing the specific registry keys, it's hard to say. The other events are normal file creations by legitimate processes. The repetition of chrome.exe modifying the registry seven times could be a sign of something, but maybe it's a benign activity. However, the presence of multiple registry events from chrome might be unusual enough to warrant further investigation. But I need to check if there's any pattern or if it's just noise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the registry changes are part of chrome's normal operation, like updating settings. But if it's happening multiple times in quick succession, that could be a sign of tampering. However, without more data, like the specific registry paths or other related events, it's hard to confirm. The other events don't seem to indicate any malicious activity. \n\nSo, considering all events together, the main point of interest is the multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe. However, since there's no other evidence of malicious activity in the other events, it might be a false positive. But the repetition could be significant. The justification would be that the batch is interesting due to the repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe, which is not typical behavior for that process. However, without more context, it's not conclusive. But the presence of multiple similar events might indicate a need for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing repeated 'Registry value set' operations (7 times) could indicate anomalous behavior, as Chrome typically does not modify registry values frequently. This pattern may suggest potential misuse or tampering, warranting further investigation.\"\n}"}
