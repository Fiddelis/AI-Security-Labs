{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple \"Image loaded\" events for SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Those are legitimate system DLLs, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a process named rundll32.exe executing a command with shell32.dll. That seems okay, but the command line looks a bit odd with that GUID. Maybe it's part of a legitimate process, but sometimes that's used in exploits.\n\nThen there's svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be normal during configuration. But then EXCEL.EXE is loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. But the fact that Excel is loading so many DLLs might be part of normal operation, but maybe there's something else.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple \"User Account Management\" events, but no process names. That could be normal, but if there are a lot of them, maybe something's happening with user accounts. However, in this batch, they don't seem to be linked to any malicious activity.\n\nWait, there's also a WmiPrvSE.exe process, which is related to WMI. The command line includes -secured and -Embedding, which might be part of a legitimate WMI operation. But sometimes attackers use WMI for persistence.\n\nAnother thing: EXCEL.EXE is creating a shortcut file in the Recent folder. That's normal when you open a file, but maybe if it's doing that multiple times or with unusual paths, it could be suspicious. However, in this case, it's just one instance.\n\nThe main thing I notice is the repeated loading of DLLs by SDXHelper.exe and EXCEL.EXE. However, those DLLs are all legitimate system files. The only potentially suspicious part is the rundll32.exe command with that GUID. But without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious. Also, the presence of multiple User Account Management events, but they don't have process info, so maybe not linked to anything.\n\nHmm. On the other hand, there's a lot of activity from EXCEL.EXE, which is unusual. Maybe it's being used as a vector for something, but the logs don't show any obvious malicious behavior. The fact that there are multiple ImageLoad events for legitimate DLLs might not be a problem. However, the presence of winlogbeat creating a file might be normal, but if that's part of a setup, maybe not.\n\nOverall, I don't see any clear signs of malicious activity. The events seem to be part of normal system operations, even if some processes are loading multiple DLLs. Unless there's a known bad actor or a specific rule that flags these events, but based on the information given, it's not clearly interesting. So the classification would be NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASON\": \"The log entries reflect standard system and application activities, including legitimate DLL loading by processes like SDXHelper.exe and EXCEL.EXE, routine WMI operations via WmiPrvSE.exe, and benign file creation by winlogbeat and EXCEL.EXE. No anomalies, suspicious commands, or indicators of compromise (e.g., unexpected network activity, unauthorized access, or malicious payloads) are present. The repeated 'User Account Management' events lack contextual details to suggest malicious intent.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about a file creation in the Recent folder with a .LNK file. The name is real_values.csv.LNK. That's a shortcut file, which might be suspicious if it's being created in a location like AppData. But why is it being created by Excel? Maybe a user is just saving a shortcut, but sometimes malware creates shortcuts to hide malicious files.\n\nThen there are three DNS query events from Excel. DNS queries themselves aren't necessarily bad, but if there are multiple queries in a short time, that could indicate something like command and control traffic. However, Excel might be doing normal lookups, like checking for updates or accessing online resources. But the fact that all three are from the same process (Excel) and the same user (fiddelis) might be a red flag. \n\nWait, the first event is a file creation, and then three DNS queries. Could there be a connection? Maybe the shortcut is pointing to a malicious file, and the DNS queries are part of communication with a C2 server. But without more info, like the domains being queried, it's hard to tell. However, the combination of creating a shortcut in a sensitive area and multiple DNS queries from Excel might be worth investigating. \n\nI should check if creating a .LNK file in the Recent folder is normal. Office applications sometimes create shortcuts there, but if it's a user's own file, it's okay. However, if the file is named something like real_values.csv.LNK, maybe it's a legitimate file. But the DNS queries could still be suspicious. \n\nThe key here is that the batch includes both a file creation in a potentially sensitive location and multiple DNS queries from the same process. Even though each event alone might not be suspicious, together they might indicate a larger pattern. The justification would be the combination of these events. \n\nSo, the classification is \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of creating a shortcut in the Recent folder and multiple DNS queries from Excel could indicate a potential security threat, such as a malicious payload or data exfiltration attempt.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes a file creation event for a .LNK shortcut in the Office Recent folder combined with multiple DNS queries from Excel. This combination may indicate suspicious behavior, such as a malicious shortcut attempting to communicate with a C2 server or exfiltrate data.\"\n}"}
