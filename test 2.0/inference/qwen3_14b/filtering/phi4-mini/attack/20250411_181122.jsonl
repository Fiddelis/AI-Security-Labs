{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate Windows tool that displays user information. The process create event here seems normal. Then there's 'powershell.exe' being accessed and some registry changes. PowerShell is common, but when combined with certain activities, it can be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's a PowerShell command that uses 'findstr' and 'select-string' to search for passwords in files. That command line is interesting because searching for passwords in various file types might indicate an attempt to find sensitive information. The command is run multiple times, which could be part of a script or repeated checks.\n\nThen there are several 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, which include .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard for PowerShell, but the presence of multiple image loads might be normal depending on the context. However, the fact that it's loading multiple .NET components could be part of a more complex script or payload.\n\nThere's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic used by malware to avoid leaving traces. The file is a PowerShell script, which might be part of an attack chain where the script is executed and then cleaned up.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the same command line might indicate that the process is being monitored or that there's some kind of logging or detection mechanism in place, but it could also be part of an automated attack.\n\nAdditionally, there's a 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file, which is a log shipper. However, the file path and the .yml.new extension might suggest configuration changes, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nOther entries include 'notepad.exe' modifying the registry and 'calc.exe' loading urlmon.dll. Notepad and Calculator are legitimate, but registry changes could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more suspicious activity, these might be benign.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated PowerShell activities, the search for passwords, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the multiple image loads might indicate an investigation-worthy scenario. The presence of multiple 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events for PowerShell could be part of a script that's trying to escalate privileges or access sensitive data. The command line that searches for passwords is a clear indicator of potential data exfiltration or reconnaissance.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. Some of these events could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. But the combination of searching for passwords, temporary file operations, and multiple PowerShell activities does raise flags. It's possible that this is a red herring, but given the information, it's on the edge of being suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain several activities that could indicate potential malicious behavior or warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activities**\n1. **Password Search via PowerShell**:\n   - **Command**: \n     ```powershell\n     findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls | select-string -Pattern password\n     ```\n     This command searches for files containing \"password\" in common file types (e.g., `.xml`, `.doc`, `.txt`, `.xls`). Such activity is **highly suspicious** and could indicate **data exfiltration** or **reconnaissance** for sensitive information (e.g., credentials, configuration files).\n\n   - **Repetition**: The same command appears **multiple times** under \"Provider Lifecycle\" events, suggesting automation or repeated probing.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A file (`winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`) is created and immediately deleted. This pattern is commonly used by **malware** to avoid leaving traces on the system.\n\n3. **PowerShell Image Loads**:\n   - Multiple `.NET` assemblies (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are loaded by PowerShell. While legitimate, this could indicate **script execution** or **payload delivery** (e.g., through PowerShell remoting or obfuscated scripts).\n\n4. **Unusual Registry Modifications**:\n   - **`notepad.exe`** and **`powershell.exe`** modify registry values. While not inherently malicious, this could be part of **persistence mechanisms** or **configuration changes**.\n\n5. **Provider Lifecycle Events**:\n   - Repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with the same PowerShell command suggest **monitoring** or **logging** by a tool (e.g., `winlogbeat`). However, this could also be a **red herring** or part of a larger attack chain.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activities**\n- **`whoami.exe`**: A standard Windows utility for checking user context.\n- **`calc.exe`** and **`notepad.exe`**: Common utilities, but their use in conjunction with suspicious activities (e.g., registry changes) requires scrutiny.\n- **`winlogbeat.exe`**: A legitimate log shipper, but the `.yml.new` file suggests potential configuration tampering.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of logs **raises significant flags** due to:\n- The **repeated use of PowerShell** to search for sensitive data.\n- **File creation\/deletion** in the `Temp` directory, a common malware tactic.\n- **Registry modifications** by non-admin tools (`notepad.exe`, `powershell.exe`).\n\n**Recommendation**:  \n- Investigate the **PowerShell command** and its origin (e.g., is it part of a script, scheduled task, or user activity?).  \n- Check for **unauthorized configuration changes** (e.g., the `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file).  \n- Monitor **user activity** around the time of these events for lateral movement or data exfiltration.  \n- Consider **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** tools to correlate these logs with process behavior and network traffic.\n\n**Final Verdict**: **Yes**, this batch warrants further investigation due to the combination of suspicious PowerShell activity, temporary file operations, and potential data reconnaissance."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The options are either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the logs to see what's going on. Let's look at the first entry. There's a process called powershell.exe with a task \"Image loaded\" pointing to a file in the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal, maybe part of the defender's operation.\n\nThen there's another entry where powershell.exe is running a command to find passwords in files. The command line looks like it's searching for 'pass' in various file types. That might be a red flag because searching for passwords could be part of a malicious activity, like data exfiltration. But it's also possible that it's a legitimate script, maybe part of a security check. However, the repetition of similar commands might indicate something more.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe creating files, like in the StartupProfileData and a downloaded txt file. Creating files in user directories could be normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it might be suspicious. Also, the registry value changes and process accesses might be normal system activities, but combined with other events, they could indicate something.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are mostly about registry changes and network connections. That's common for browsers, but multiple network connections might be normal too. However, the presence of multiple powershell.exe activities, especially the one searching for passwords, stands out. \n\nWait, the same command line appears twice. That might be a sign of repeated attempts or a script that's running multiple times. Also, the file created in the Downloads folder named \"objeto_logico.txt\" â€“ that's a Spanish term meaning \"logical object,\" which could be a red herring, but maybe it's a file that's been created as part of an attack.\n\nAnother thing is the image loaded events pointing to MpClient.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. That's normal, but if there's an unusual number of such events, it might be a sign of something. However, in this case, it's just a couple of entries.\n\nPutting this all together: the main suspicious points are the powershell.exe command searching for passwords, the creation of files, and the repetition of certain commands. However, without more context, like the presence of other malicious activities or known bad indicators, it's hard to say for sure. But the fact that there are multiple events that could be part of a data collection or exfiltration attempt makes this batch interesting. Even if some events are normal, the combination might suggest a potential security incident that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes executing password search commands (findstr\/select-string) across files, combined with file creation events in user directories and repeated registry modifications, suggests potential data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity warranting further investigation.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there are multiple entries where chrome.exe is setting a registry value. That's a bit odd because Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much. But maybe it's just normal behavior, like updating settings. However, seeing it repeated several times might be a red flag.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe it's part of a legitimate setup. But the file name has a .yml.new extension, which could be a temporary file during configuration. Not sure yet, but not immediately suspicious.\n\nNext, powershell.exe is creating a file called estrutura_ativo.txt. That's a text file, maybe just a normal file creation. But PowerShell is often used for more complex tasks, so I'll keep an eye on that.\n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe process, which is usually used to check the current user. Not too bad. But then there are several instances of powershell.exe being accessed, which might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be part of a script.\n\nThe cmd.exe process has a command line that deletes scheduled tasks. The command line is using schtasks to delete tasks named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks might be part of a cleanup, but if done without proper authorization, it could be malicious. Also, the use of redirection to nul suggests the user might be trying to hide the output, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nThen there's another schtasks.exe process deleting another task named \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\" and \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". This seems like a pattern of deleting tasks, which might be part of removing malicious tasks or just normal maintenance. But the repetition of task names with similar prefixes (unidade, elemento, registro) could indicate an organized effort, possibly malicious.\n\nThe WMIC.exe process is used to delete notepad.exe processes. Using WMIC to delete processes can be a sign of someone trying to remove processes that might be part of an attack or just normal cleanup. However, deleting notepad.exe might be part of a larger script.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: multiple scheduled tasks being deleted, use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for these operations, and the repetition of similar task names. Also, the presence of winlogbeat might be part of a legitimate setup, but combined with these deletions, it's worth investigating. The fact that the user is deleting multiple scheduled tasks could be an attempt to remove backdoors or other malicious tasks. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious or just a user cleaning up.\n\nBut the key points here are the deletion of scheduled tasks, which is a significant action, and the use of commands that could be part of an attack. The repetition of similar task names might indicate a pattern, and the use of redirection to suppress output is suspicious. Therefore, this batch is likely worth investigating further to determine if there's an underlying malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several **suspicious activities** that warrant further investigation, as they may indicate **malicious behavior** or **unauthorized system modifications**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**:\n\n1. **Deletion of Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - **`cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe`** are used to delete multiple scheduled tasks with names like:\n     - `unidade_geral_005_OnLogon`\n     - `unidade_comum_005_OnStartup`\n     - `elemento_base_005_OnLogon`\n     - `registro_base_005_OnStartup`\n   - **Why this is suspicious**:\n     - Deleting scheduled tasks could be an attempt to **remove malicious payloads** or **hide persistence mechanisms**.\n     - The repetitive naming pattern (`unidade`, `elemento`, `registro`) suggests a **systematic cleanup**, possibly tied to an attack chain or unauthorized access.\n\n2. **Use of `WMIC.exe` to Terminate Processes**:\n   - **`WMIC.exe`** is used to delete `notepad.exe` processes:\n     ```bash\n     wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\n     ```\n   - **Why this is suspicious**:\n     - `WMIC` is often abused in **malware** for process manipulation or lateral movement.\n     - Deleting `notepad.exe` might be an attempt to **eliminate a legitimate process** (if it was compromised) or **mask malicious activity**.\n\n3. **Repeated Use of `PowerShell.exe` and `cmd.exe`**:\n   - **`PowerShell.exe`** is invoked multiple times with **`ProcessAccess`** events, which could indicate:\n     - Execution of scripts or commands to **modify system state**.\n     - **Lateral movement** or **data exfiltration** (if combined with other logs).\n\n4. **`whoami.exe` Usage**:\n   - **`whoami.exe`** is executed to retrieve user context. While benign, its **repetition** might suggest **credential validation** or **privilege escalation** attempts.\n\n5. **`winlogbeat.exe` File Creation**:\n   - **`winlogbeat.exe`** (a log shipper) is creating a file named `winlogbeat-*.yml.new` in the `Downloads` directory.\n   - **Why this is suspicious**:\n     - If `winlogbeat` is not part of a legitimate monitoring setup, this could indicate **misconfiguration**, **data exfiltration**, or **malicious log shipping**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Attack Scenarios**:\n- **Persistence Removal**: The deletion of scheduled tasks might be an attempt to **remove backdoors** or **malware persistence**.\n- **Process Injection**: The use of `WMIC` and `PowerShell` could be part of **process injection** or **command-line-based attacks**.\n- **Data Exfiltration**: The presence of `winlogbeat` and repeated process access might suggest **log tampering** or **data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **unauthorized user activity** (e.g., login events, privilege escalation).\n   - Investigate the **origin of the `winlogbeat` configuration** file and its contents.\n\n2. **Analyze Scheduled Task History**:\n   - Review **previous scheduled tasks** with similar names to determine if they were malicious.\n\n3. **Monitor PowerShell and CMD Activity**:\n   - Use **PowerShell logging** or **script block logging** to identify **unauthorized scripts** or **malicious commands**.\n\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Investigate **network connections** or **file transfers** around the time of these events.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThis batch of events is **highly suspicious** and **warrants immediate investigation**. The combination of **scheduled task deletion**, **process manipulation**, and **log-related activity** strongly suggests **malicious intent** or **compromise**. Further analysis is required to determine the scope and impact."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user mentioned that WMIC.exe is loading some DLLs. Wait, the first few entries show WMIC.exe loading urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. But wait, those are legitimate system files. However, the third entry is loading MpOAV.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That's a bit odd because MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, but maybe the path is suspicious? Let me check the path again: C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll. Hmm, the version number here might be a red flag. Typically, legitimate Defender files have standard version numbers, and the presence of a dash in the version (like 4.18.25030.2-0) might indicate a malicious file masquerading as a legitimate one.\n\nThen looking further, there are a lot of PowerShell and cmd.exe processes. The command lines show deletion of user accounts, like \"net user \/del\" commands. That's unusual because deleting user accounts isn't a typical administrative task and could be part of a cleanup after a compromise. Also, the use of \"net1.exe\" instead of \"net.exe\" might be a typo or a malicious replacement. The presence of multiple \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" events from PowerShell and other processes could indicate attempts to modify system settings or execute commands.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of events. Multiple entries for PowerShell accessing processes and modifying registry values might suggest ongoing activity. The combination of loading suspicious DLLs with the user account deletions could point to a multi-stage attack. Maybe the attacker is using WMIC to load malicious DLLs and then using PowerShell\/cmd to manipulate the system.\n\nHowever, I should consider if these are legitimate activities. For example, Windows Defender updates might change the version numbers, but the dash in the version is not standard. Also, the deletion of user accounts could be part of a legitimate script, but in this context, combined with the other events, it seems more suspicious.\n\nOverall, the mix of loading potentially malicious DLLs (even if they are legitimate files but in suspicious paths) and the deletion of user accounts through command-line tools suggests a possible security incident. Therefore, the batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: WMIC.exe loading DLLs from Windows Defender's directory (including a potentially spoofed MpOAV.dll with a non-standard version string), repeated PowerShell\/cmd.exe commands attempting to delete user accounts (e.g., 'net user \/del'), and numerous registry modification events. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or post-exploitation activities.\"\n}"}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: whoami.exe is run, which is normal. Then powershell.exe is accessed a few times. Registry value sets are common, but maybe too many? Then there's a cmd.exe command that deletes a service called win32times. Deleting a service might be suspicious, especially if it's a known legitimate service. Wait, win32times is part of Windows Time service, so deleting that could be bad.\n\nNext, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes temporary files. That's normal, but the path is in the Temp directory. However, the command line has some strange syntax with %%temp%%, which might be a red flag. Then, there's a file delete event for tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe in the Temp folder. Deleting files isn't inherently bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like cleaning up after malicious activity, that's concerning.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being used, which are often exploited. The Registry events might indicate attempts to modify system settings or hide malicious activities. The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events might be normal, but the way they're structured with empty commands could be a sign of something trying to evade detection.\n\nAlso, the command_line for one of the processes is 'powershell.exe & {}', which is an empty command. That might be a way to test if the logging is working or to inject code later. The repetition of these commands could indicate automated scripts or malware trying to establish persistence.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of deleting system services, unusual file deletions in Temp, multiple PowerShell and CMD executions, and Registry modifications might indicate a potential security threat. Even though some actions are normal, the frequency and combination suggest something malicious is happening. So, this batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of system service 'win32times' (critical system component), repeated PowerShell\/cmd.exe executions with obfuscated commands, file deletion in temporary directory (potential cleanup of malicious artifacts), and frequent registry modifications.

So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve powershell.exe with various tasks like ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, ImageLoad, FileCreate, and FileDeleteDetected. There are a few instances where files are created and then immediately deleted, like the __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1 file. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of an attack to hide malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events pointing to system files like mscoreei.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. While some of these are legitimate system files, the repeated loading might be normal, but combined with other events, it could indicate something's amiss.\n\nThen there's the 'whoami.exe' being executed multiple times. That's a common command to check user context, which is normal, but if it's done excessively, maybe in an attempt to escalate privileges or check permissions.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be part of inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but in combination with other events, it could be part of a larger malicious operation.\n\nHowever, I also see some entries with winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which might be part of a log collection tool, which is normal if they're using that software.\n\nBut the key points here are the repeated ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe, the creation and deletion of temporary files, and the loading of various DLLs. These could be signs of a script or malware using PowerShell to perform actions, maybe even downloading or executing payloads. The fact that the same process is accessed multiple times and files are created and deleted quickly might be an indicator of malicious behavior, especially if it's part of a script that's trying to evade detection.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. Some of these activities could be legitimate, like running scripts or using PowerShell for administrative tasks. But the combination of these events, especially the file creation and deletion, along with multiple registry accesses and process accesses, does raise suspicion. It's possible that this is a false positive, but the presence of multiple suspicious activities in a short period makes it worth investigating further.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the batch is interesting enough to warrant an investigation because the pattern of events could indicate a potential security incident, even if it's not definitively malicious yet.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe instances show repeated ProcessAccess events, file creation\/deletion of temporary scripts, and loading of system DLLs.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: whoami.exe is run, which is a normal command to get the current user. That's common and not suspicious. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is a legitimate tool, but frequent access could be a red flag if it's being used for something malicious. However, just accessing it isn't enough to be suspicious yet.\n\nNext, RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe are involved in registry changes. These are system processes, and registry modifications are normal for them. However, if there's a pattern of unusual changes, that might be a problem. But in this batch, there's no indication of malicious registry changes yet.\n\nThen there's an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file in the Downloads directory might be normal if it's part of setup. However, the file path is in the user's Downloads folder, which could be a sign of user-initiated activity, but not necessarily malicious. But I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity around this.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. Chrome doing DNS lookups and connecting to the internet is normal behavior. However, if there's a high volume or unusual destinations, that could be a problem. But the batch doesn't specify any unusual domains or IPs, so it's hard to tell from just the event names.\n\nNow, considering all the events together: there's a mix of normal system processes and legitimate activities. The only thing that stands out is the winlogbeat file creation. However, without more context like the content of the file or other related events, it's hard to classify this as suspicious. The repeated access to PowerShell might be part of normal user activity or could be a sign of something else, but again, not enough information.\n\nSince there's no clear indication of malicious activity, such as unauthorized access, unexpected network traffic to known bad domains, or unusual file modifications, the batch doesn't seem to be interesting for investigation. All events appear to be part of regular system operations or user activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal system operations and user activities (e.g., whoami.exe, chrome.exe DNS queries, PowerShell access).
