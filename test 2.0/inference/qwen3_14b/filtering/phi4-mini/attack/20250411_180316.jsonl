So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, whoami.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, chrome.exe, cmd.exe, WMIC.exe, and conhost.exe. Some of these are common system processes, like svchost.exe and chrome.exe, but others like powershell.exe and cmd.exe can be used for malicious purposes.\n\nNow, the winlog tasks: most are Registry value set, Process accessed, Image loaded, File created, and Pipe Created. The Image loaded events mention urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate system DLLs, but loading them from unexpected contexts might be a red flag. However, in this case, the paths are standard system directories, so maybe that's normal.\n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that uses wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That's a bit suspicious because using WMIC to delete processes can be part of a malicious activity, like trying to remove forensic evidence. Also, the same command is executed via WMIC.exe, which is another system tool but often abused in attacks.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of powershell.exe and ProcessAccess events. While PowerShell is common, multiple access events might indicate someone is trying to manipulate processes. However, without more context like unusual commands or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event shows a file created in the Downloads directory. That's a normal user activity, so probably not a threat. The whoami.exe process is just checking the user, which is benign.\n\nLooking at the WMIC.exe events, they're loading DLLs from system paths, which is normal. But the combination of using WMIC and cmd to delete processes might be part of a larger attack. However, the batch doesn't show any clear signs of data exfiltration, persistence, or other malicious behaviors beyond process deletion.\n\nSo, the main points of interest are the use of WMIC and cmd to delete processes, which could be an attempt to cover tracks. But since there's no other malicious activity detected in the batch, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the presence of these commands might still warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: 1) 'cmd.exe' executing 'wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete' to terminate processes, which could indicate process injection or cover-up attempts. 2) 'WMIC.exe' loading DLLs from system directories (urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) which may suggest evasion techniques. 3) Frequent 'Registry value set' events across system processes that could indicate configuration changes or persistence attempts.\"\n}"}

So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, whoami.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe, schtasks.exe. Some of these are common, like chrome and powershell, but others like schtasks and whoami might be more concerning depending on the context.\n\nNow, the winlog tasks. There's a lot of Registry value set events, which could be normal, but combined with other actions might indicate something. The Process accessed events might be part of normal operations, but again, need to check for anomalies.\n\nWait, here's a line: \"cmd.exe \/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". That looks like someone is copying a backup executable to replace the original sethc.exe. Sethc is the Sticky Keys executable, and replacing it with a backup could be a sign of malware, like a backdoor. This is a classic technique used in some attacks, like the \"Sticky Keys\" exploit.\n\nAlso, there's schtasks.exe being used to delete a task named \"win32times\". Deleting a scheduled task might be part of cleaning up after an attack. Then, there's an image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, and if it's being loaded, maybe there's an attempt to bypass it. But I need to check if that's suspicious here.\n\nOther entries include whoami.exe being run multiple times, which is just getting the user context, so that's normal. Powershell.exe being accessed and registry changes could be part of normal operations, but combined with the copy command and task deletion, it's more suspicious.\n\nSo the key points here are the cmd.exe command copying sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe, which is a red flag. Also, the deletion of a scheduled task might be part of covering tracks.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user is asking me to analyze these logs and determine if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to look through all the events. There are a bunch of PowerShell.exe processes. That alone isn't necessarily bad, but I should check what they're doing. Let me scan through the winlog tasks and file paths.\n\nI see some entries with \"Pipe Created\" and \"File created\" events. The file created one is in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That might be normal, but I need to check more. Then there's a \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed\" events. Those could be signs of something trying to modify settings or access other processes.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances where PowerShell is running scripts that check for the existence of certain .bat files. The paths here are a bit suspicious. For example, \"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\" â€“ the use of \"..\" suggests they're navigating directories, which might be trying to access files outside the intended path. But wait, the paths have a mix of Portuguese terms and other parts. Maybe that's just the naming convention, but the repeated checking of these files could be part of a script that's trying to see if certain files exist to proceed.\n\nThen there's the \"Image loaded\" events. PowerShell is loading clr.dll and clrjit.dll, which are related to .NET. That's normal for PowerShell, but also loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That might be part of the system's own processes, but I should check if that's unusual here.\n\nAnother thing is the \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks. Those might be related to PowerShell providers, which are used for interacting with different data stores. But if they're being used in a way that's not typical, that could be a red flag.\n\nI also notice that there are multiple \"Process accessed\" events. If a process is being accessed repeatedly, that might indicate someone trying to manipulate or monitor it.\n\nPutting this all together: there's a lot of PowerShell activity, checking for specific files, loading .NET components, and interacting with the registry and files. While some of this could be legitimate, the pattern of checking multiple files in various directories with potentially malicious paths (even if the names are in Portuguese) might indicate an attempt to execute scripts or access files that could be part of a larger attack. The fact that there are multiple events related to file creation, registry changes, and image loading might be indicative of a script trying to set up persistence or modify system settings.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to assume malicious intent without more context. But given the number of events and the types of operations being performed, it does seem suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So, I think this batch is interesting and should be looked into more.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Indicators of Concern:\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Script Execution**:\n   - Multiple `Process Create` and `Process Access` events involve PowerShell running scripts that check for the existence of `.bat` files (e.g., `tarefa_base_script.bat`). These scripts use directory traversal (`..`) to navigate paths, which may indicate attempts to access files outside expected directories or evade detection.\n\n2. **Unusual File Creation**:\n   - A file is created in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`), which could be part of script execution or payload delivery.\n\n3. **Registry and Process Manipulation**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` and `Process Access` events suggest attempts to modify system settings or interact with other processes, potentially for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\n4. **Loading of .NET and Defender Components**:\n   - PowerShell loads `.NET` libraries (`clr.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender). While not inherently malicious, this could indicate an attempt to leverage .NET for code execution or interact with security tools (e.g., bypassing defenses).\n\n5. **Non-Standard File Paths**:\n   - File paths contain non-English terms (e.g., `objeto_ativo_script.bat`) and inconsistent directory structures, which may hint at obfuscation or targeting specific systems.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe combination of **repetitive PowerShell activity**, **file\/registry manipulation**, and **unusual file paths** raises **red flags** for potential **malicious behavior** (e.g., script-based attacks, persistence mechanisms, or evasion techniques). While further context (e.g., user intent, system baseline) is needed, these events are **sufficiently suspicious to warrant investigation**. \n\n**Recommendation**: Perform deeper analysis (e.g., inspect script content, check for unauthorized modifications, monitor user activity) and consider isolating the affected system if risks are confirmed."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe is deleting a file in the Temp directory. That's a common place for temporary files, so maybe not suspicious on its own. But then there's another event where powershell.exe creates a file in the Downloads folder. Still, that's a normal user area.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. A lot of them, but chrome might legitimately modify the registry. However, the repetition might be a red flag. But I need to check if there's a pattern.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process that's checking if certain files exist. The paths here are a bit odd. For example, \"C:\\\\modulo_ativo\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\\\\objeto_temporario_script.bat\" â€“ the use of \"..\" suggests navigating up directories, which could be part of a path traversal. But again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen, there's an event where powershell.exe creates a file in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell directory. That's a legitimate location for PowerShell profiles, so maybe okay.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe loading a DLL from Windows Defender. That's expected, as Defender might inject modules. But then there's another image load for mscoreei.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are part of .NET and Windows Defender, so again, normal.\n\nWait, but there are several events where powershell.exe is creating files in various directories, like \"C:\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_base\\\\componente_temporario_script.bat\" and similar paths. The use of \"..\" here might be to bypass certain restrictions or access parent directories. Also, the command lines show New-Item and Set-Content commands, which are creating files and setting their content. The content is \"dir\", which is a simple command, but the fact that multiple such files are being created in different locations might indicate some automated process.\n\nAdditionally, the command lines have a pattern: creating a new item (file) and then setting content. The paths are structured with multiple directory levels, which could be an attempt to hide the actual location or to access areas that aren't typically monitored. However, without seeing the actual content of these files or more context, it's hard to say if they are malicious.\n\nBut considering that PowerShell is often used in attacks for its scripting capabilities, and the fact that there are multiple file creation events in various parts of the system, even if they're in legitimate directories, it might be worth investigating. Also, the repetition of similar commands across different paths could be a sign of a script that's being run multiple times, possibly as part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother point is the use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" events, which might relate to PowerShell providers, which are used to access different data stores. But again, that's a normal part of PowerShell's functionality.\n\nSo, putting this all together: while some events are normal, the combination of multiple file creations in various directories using PowerShell, along with repeated registry modifications by Chrome, might indicate either a legitimate but unusual activity or a potential security incident. However, without more context or additional indicators (like network activity, unexpected processes, etc.), it's a bit ambiguous. But given that the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, the presence of these multiple PowerShell-related events with file operations in different areas could be a point of interest.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior warranting further investigation. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell File Creation & Manipulation:**\n   - **Multiple `New-Item` and `Set-Content` commands** are executed across various directories (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\modulo_secundario\\..`, `C:\\registro_geral\\componente_ativo\\..`). These paths use `..` to navigate up directories, which could be an attempt to bypass access restrictions or obscure the true location of files.\n   - The created files (e.g., `objeto_temporario_script.bat`, `registro_secundario_script.bat`) are named with generic terms and contain the command `dir`, which is benign on its own but raises questions about their purpose and whether they are part of a larger script.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications by Chrome:**\n   - **Repeated `ProcessAccess` and `ImageLoad` events** for `chrome.exe` and its associated DLLs (e.g., `mscoreei.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) are normal. However, the **high frequency of registry modifications** might indicate an unusual interaction or potential tampering if not expected.\n\n3. **Windows Defender DLL Loads:**\n   - **Legitimate image loads** (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`) are expected for system operations, but their presence alongside PowerShell activity could be coincidental or part of a larger chain of events.\n\n4. **Provider Lifecycle Events:**\n   - PowerShell's use of **providers** (e.g., `Provider Lifecycle` events) is standard for interacting with file systems, but the **repetition of similar commands** across different paths suggests automation, which may be benign or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Red Flags:**\n- **Unusual File Paths:** The use of `..` in file paths may indicate attempts to access parent directories, possibly to bypass restrictions or evade detection.\n- **Scripting Activity:** The repeated creation of `.bat` files with simple commands (`dir`) could be part of a larger script or attack chain, especially if these files are later executed or used to download additional payloads.\n- **Lack of Context:** Without additional indicators (e.g., network traffic, anomalous process behavior, or user context), the activity is ambiguous but warrants deeper analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for associated network activity, process execution, or user behavior (e.g., did the user interact with these files? Are they being executed?).\n2. **Analyze File Content:** Investigate the contents of created `.bat` files to determine if they contain malicious commands or are being used as pivots.\n3. **Monitor PowerShell Usage:** Review PowerShell logs for other suspicious commands (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `DownloadString`, or lateral movement).\n4. **Check for Privilege Escalation:** Determine if these activities occurred under a privileged account or if elevation was used.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activity is legitimate, the **combination of PowerShell file manipulation, repeated registry changes, and non-standard file paths** suggests a need for further investigation. This could indicate either a benign but unusual script or a potential security incident."}

The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each of the JSON entries and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell processes. There are several instances where PowerShell is creating files, like using New-Item and Set-Content commands. The command lines show that they're creating batch files in various directories and setting their content to \"dir\". That seems a bit odd because \"dir\" is a basic command to list directory contents. But why create so many batch files with just \"dir\"? Maybe that's a red flag.\n\nLooking at the file paths, some of them have \"..\\\" which is a directory traversal. For example, \"C:\\\\pacote_padrao\\\\componente_principal\\\\..\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\modulo_base_script.bat\" â€“ the \"..\\\\\" could be trying to move up a directory level. That might be an attempt to write files in a different directory than intended, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nThen there are events where files are created and then immediately deleted, like the __PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1 file. That could be part of a script that's testing execution policies or trying to bypass them. Also, the presence of multiple file creation and deletion events might indicate some kind of cleanup or obfuscation.\n\nAnother thing is the image loaded events, where PowerShell is loading .NET assemblies like clr.dll and mscoreei.dll. That's normal for PowerShell, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a more complex process.\n\nThe registry value set events and process access events could be related to modifying system settings or accessing other processes, which might be part of a larger attack. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated creation of batch files with simple commands, directory traversal in paths, and the combination of file creation\/deletion might be indicative of a script trying to establish persistence or perform some actions on the system. Even though the commands are basic, the pattern and the number of such events could be suspicious. Therefore, this batch of events is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is **suspicious and warrants further investigation**. Here's the breakdown of key indicators:\n\n### 1. **Abnormal PowerShell Activity**\n   - **File Creation via PowerShell**: Multiple PowerShell processes use `New-Item` and `Set-Content` to create batch files (`*.bat`) with the content `\"dir\"` (a basic directory listing command). This is unusual because:\n     - **\"dir\" as payload**: A simple command like `dir` is not typically useful for malicious purposes, suggesting either obfuscation or a placeholder for more complex logic.\n     - **Directory Traversal in Paths**: File paths like `C:\\pacote_padrao\\componente_principal\\..\\tarefa_ativo\\modulo_base_script.bat` use `..` to traverse directories, which could indicate an attempt to write files in unintended locations (e.g., system directories or hidden paths).\n\n   - **Test-Path Checks**: Scripts like `if (Test-Path \"C:\\modulo_secundario\\...\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }` suggest **conditional logic** that may be part of a larger attack chain (e.g., checking for existing files before proceeding).\n\n### 2. **File Creation\/Deletion Patterns**\n   - A file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`) is **created and immediately deleted**, which is a common tactic to:\n     - **Bypass execution policy checks** (e.g., testing if PowerShell scripts can run in a restricted environment).\n     - **Obfuscate malicious activity** by leaving no trace of the file.\n\n### 3. **Unusual .NET Assembly Loads**\n   - PowerShell loads .NET assemblies like `mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, and `clr.dll`. While normal for PowerShell, this could indicate:\n     - **Execution of .NET-based payloads** (e.g., compiled malware or scripts using advanced .NET features).\n     - **Attempts to bypass detection** by leveraging legitimate .NET components.\n\n### 4. **Lack of Clear Purpose**\n   - The repeated creation of trivial batch files (`dir`) with no apparent functional purpose raises concerns about **malicious intent** (e.g., establishing persistence, testing system vulnerabilities, or preparing for further attacks).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation**\n- **Check for Hidden Files\/Processes**: Investigate if the `..` directory traversal in file paths points to hidden or restricted directories.\n- **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**: Examine the contents of deleted files (if recoverable) and check for obfuscated or encoded commands.\n- **Monitor for Follow-On Activity**: Look for additional PowerShell scripts, network connections, or changes to system settings (e.g., registry modifications).\n- **Correlate with Other Logs**: Cross-reference these events with system logs, network traffic, and user activity to identify potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combination of **anomalous PowerShell behavior**, **suspicious file operations**, and **unusual .NET activity** indicates a high likelihood of **malicious activity**. This warrants immediate investigation to determine if the system has been compromised."}

So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell processes. There are several instances where PowerShell is running commands that check if certain files exist using Test-Path. The command lines have a similar structure: checking if a specific .bat file exists, then exiting 0 or 1. These paths look a bit suspicious because they have a lot of directories with names like \"registro_secundario\", \"componente_temporario\", etc. These might be obfuscated paths, which is a common tactic in malicious activities.\n\nThen there's an event where a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1 is deleted from the Temp directory. That could be part of a cleanup process, which is something malware might do to remove traces. Another event shows a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That's a bit unusual because PowerShell startup profiles are typically in specific locations, and creating a file there might indicate some configuration change or persistence mechanism.\n\nThere are also events related to registry value sets and process accesses. While these aren't inherently malicious, they could be part of a larger attack. The presence of multiple PowerShell processes executing similar checks might be trying to determine if certain files exist, possibly to check for the presence of other malware components or to see if they can execute their own scripts.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any actual malicious activity here. The events don't show any execution of malicious code, just checks for file existence. The only file deletion is of a temporary script, which might be normal. The creation of the StartupProfileData file could be benign, like a PowerShell profile being set up. But the repetition of similar commands across different paths might indicate a pattern. Also, the use of obfuscated paths with multiple directory levels could be an attempt to evade detection.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the events are related to Windows Defender's MpClient.dll, which is a legitimate file. The Process Create event for whoami.exe is also normal. However, the combination of these PowerShell activities with the other events might be worth investigating further. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate script, but the suspicious paths and the number of similar events could indicate something more. \n\nConsidering all that, while there's no direct evidence of malware, the patterns observed are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. Therefore, the answer should be that this batch is interesting and requires a deeper look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, though no direct malicious activity is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**:\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Commands with Obfuscated Paths**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like `Test-Path` on file paths with highly obfuscated, non-standard directory structures (e.g., `C:\\registro_secundario\\componente_temporario\\...`). These paths use terms like \"registro,\" \"componente,\" and \"modulo,\" which may be obfuscation or mimic legitimate system terms.\n   - Example:  \n     ```powershell\n     if (Test-Path \"C:\\registro_ativo\\elemento_temporario\\objeto_ativo\\bin\\unidade_comum.exe\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }\n     ```\n   - **Why Suspicious**: Such patterns are common in malware for checking for the presence of files, establishing persistence, or evading detection.\n\n2. **File Deletion in Temp Directory**:\n   - A file named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1` is deleted from the Temp directory.  \n   - **Why Suspicious**: This could indicate cleanup of temporary files, potentially part of a script or malware lifecycle to remove traces.\n\n3. **Unusual File Creation**:\n   - A file is created in the `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` folder, which is not a standard location for PowerShell profiles.  \n   - **Why Suspicious**: This might suggest an attempt to modify PowerShell startup behavior or establish persistence.\n\n4. **Multiple Registry and Process Access Events**:\n   - Frequent `Registry value set` and `Process accessed` events involving PowerShell could indicate attempts to modify system settings or interact with other processes.\n\n### **Legitimate Contexts**:\n- The presence of `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender) and `whoami.exe` suggests some activities are legitimate. However, these are not sufficient to dismiss the suspicious patterns.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile no direct malicious code is executed in the logs, the **repetitive, obfuscated PowerShell commands** and **unusual file operations** are highly indicative of **potential malicious activity** (e.g., reconnaissance, persistence, or evasion). This batch **requires further investigation** to confirm whether these activities are part of a legitimate script or a security threat.\n\n**Answer**:  \nYes, this batch is **interesting for investigation** due to the suspicious patterns of obfuscated PowerShell commands, unusual file operations, and repeated registry\/process access events. Further analysis is recommended."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries related to PowerShell.exe. Now, PowerShell is a common tool used by attackers, so that's a red flag. Let me check the specific events.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's \"Image loaded\" events for mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. These are part of the .NET framework, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a sign of something malicious, like creating a temporary script and then deleting it to avoid leaving traces. \n\nThen there are some PowerShell commands checking if certain executables exist. The paths mentioned, like \"C:\\registro_principal...\" and \"C:\\objeto_auxiliar...\", these don't look like standard system paths. They might be trying to access files in non-standard locations, which could be part of an attack. \n\nAlso, there are multiple \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" events. These could indicate that the process is interacting with the registry, which is a common technique for persistence or modifying system settings. \n\nAnother thing is the repetition of certain events. For example, \"whoami.exe\" is executed multiple times. While whoami itself is a legitimate command, if it's being called repeatedly, that might be part of a script or attack. \n\nThe \"Pipe Created\" event might be less concerning on its own, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger attack vector. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these events could be benign. For instance, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and checking file existence is a standard operation.

The fact that there's a file created and then deleted, along with multiple process accesses and registry changes, even if individual events are not overtly malicious, together they form a pattern that's worth investigating. \n\nSo, I think the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" because the cumulative effect of these events suggests potential malicious activity, even if individual events aren't conclusive on their own.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events show suspicious patterns: temporary files created\/deleted, non-standard path checks, and repeated process\/registry interactions.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines representing system events. My job is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve PowerShell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the details.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are several 'Process Create' and 'Image Loaded' events. The image loaded events reference .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate .NET components, so that might be normal. But then there are a bunch of 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with command lines that check for specific files. The command lines use Test-Path to check if certain .cs files exist, then exit 0 or 1. \n\nWait, why are they checking for these .cs files? Maybe they're part of a script that's trying to determine if certain files are present. But the paths mentioned are all in different directories, like C:\\registro_principal, C:\\modulo_secundario, etc. These don't look like standard system paths. Also, the fact that there are multiple checks for different .cs files might indicate that the attacker is probing the system for specific files, perhaps looking for vulnerabilities or trying to see if certain conditions are met.\n\nThen there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. The creation and deletion of a temporary script file could be part of a script execution, which is common but might be suspicious if it's part of a larger pattern. However, the name includes 'PSScriptPolicyTest', which sounds like it could be related to PowerShell execution policy testing, which is a legitimate activity. But combined with other events, maybe it's part of something more.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Process accessed' events. Accessing a process isn't inherently bad, but if combined with other suspicious activities, it might be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of the Test-Path commands in different directories. This could be a way to check for the presence of files that might be part of a larger attack, like checking if certain tools are installed, or if specific files are present that could be exploited.\n\nBut then again, some of these could be benign. For example, if someone is developing software and testing file existence, but the number of events and the specific nature of the files (like .cs files in various directories) might be more indicative of malicious activity.\n\nThe fact that there's a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory might be related to PowerShell profiles being modified, which could be a way to persist access. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the presence of multiple PowerShell events, checking for specific files, creating and deleting temporary scripts, and accessing processes might be indicative of a potential security threat. However, some activities could be legitimate. The key is the combination of these events and their context. Since the user is asking if this batch is interesting for investigation, the answer would lean towards yes, as there are multiple suspicious activities that warrant further examination.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events presents a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Frequent Use of PowerShell:** Multiple events involve `powershell.exe`, which is common but can be abused for malicious purposes (e.g., script execution, lateral movement).\n   - **Test-Path Commands:** The command lines repeatedly use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of `.cs` files in non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_principal`, `C:\\modulo_secundario`). This could indicate probing for specific files (e.g., source code, vulnerabilities, or misconfigurations) or testing conditions for subsequent actions.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted in the `Temp` directory. While this could be legitimate (e.g., policy testing), the name and transient nature might hint at obfuscation or evasion tactics.\n\n3. **Image Loading:**\n   - Legitimate .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are loaded, which is normal for PowerShell operations. However, this could also be part of a malicious payload if combined with other suspicious behavior.\n\n4. **Lifecycle Events:**\n   - **Provider\/Engine Lifecycle Events:** These are typically related to PowerShell host interactions. However, their repetition could indicate automated or scripted activity, possibly for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\n5. **File Paths:**\n   - The `.cs` files referenced (e.g., `elemento_base.cs`, `estrutura_geral.cs`) suggest potential interest in source code or application-specific files, which might be part of a reconnaissance phase or exploitation attempt.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **Reconnaissance:** The repeated `Test-Path` checks may indicate the attacker is probing the system for specific files or directories, possibly to identify targets for exploitation (e.g., checking for misconfigured applications, vulnerabilities, or sensitive data).\n- **Script Execution:** The temporary script file creation\/deletion could be part of a larger script execution chain, potentially used to bypass security policies or execute malicious code.\n- **Persistence:** The `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` file creation might hint at attempts to modify PowerShell profiles for persistence, though this requires further context.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for additional logs (e.g., network traffic, registry changes, user activity) to confirm if these events are part of a larger attack.\n- **Analyze the Temporary Script:** If possible, inspect the content of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1` (if still present) to determine its purpose.\n- **Monitor for Follow-On Activity:** Watch for subsequent actions like data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or lateral movement.\n- **Check File Integrity:** Verify the integrity of the `.cs` files referenced in `Test-Path` commands to ensure they are not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to the combination of PowerShell activity, file probing, and transient script execution. While some behaviors (e.g., .NET DLL loading) are benign, the repetitive nature of the `Test-Path` commands and the file creation\/deletion warrant closer scrutiny to rule out malicious intent."}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the entries are about PowerShell.exe processes. There are several instances where PowerShell is accessing processes or modifying registry values. But what stands out are the command lines in some of the processes. For example, there's a command line that checks if a file named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 exists in various paths. The script seems to exit with 0 if the file is found, else 1. \n\nWait, Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds suspicious. That name might be related to keylogging, which is a common malicious activity. Even though the script here is just checking the existence of the file, the presence of such a script name could indicate an attempt to load or execute a malicious script later. \n\nAlso, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is loading .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. That's normal for PowerShell, but combined with the other events, it might be part of a larger process. \n\nThen there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic used by malware to avoid leaving traces. The file is a PowerShell script, which could be part of an attack. \n\nThe repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different directories might be part of an attacker trying to locate a payload or ensure that the necessary files are in place. Even if they're not executing it yet, the presence of such scripts is a red flag. \n\nAdditionally, the multiple ProcessAccess events and Registry value changes could indicate that the attacker is trying to maintain persistence or modify system settings. \n\nPutting this all together: the combination of suspicious script names, file creation and deletion in temp folders, and multiple PowerShell activities that are not typical user behavior suggests that this might be a security incident. Even though no direct execution of the malicious script is seen here, the indicators are present and warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are checking for the existence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' in various paths, which is suspicious.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs to see if there's anything suspicious. First, I notice that there are several PowerShell processes running with command lines that check for the existence of a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The paths mentioned are C:\\tarefa_temporario... and C:\\unidade_logico..., which don't look like standard system directories. That's a red flag because malicious scripts often use such paths to avoid detection.\n\nThen, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file path is in the Downloads directory, which might be normal, but the repeated creation of .yml.new files could indicate configuration changes or attempts to modify settings. However, without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are multiple ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent entries for PowerShell and other processes. These could be part of normal operations, but combined with the earlier script checks, they might suggest someone is trying to execute or access sensitive information. The use of whoami.exe is common for checking user context, but paired with the other activities, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe NetworkConnect and DnsQuery events for chrome.exe are probably normal browsing activity. However, the frequency of these events might be high, but that's not clear from the data provided. The svchost.exe processes making network connections could be legitimate, but sometimes they're used by malware to communicate.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 check in non-standard paths, along with multiple process and registry accesses, suggests potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity related to powershell.exe. The first event shows a command line with ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, and gci -recurse. These are PowerShell commands that recursively list files and directories. That's a common legitimate activity, but sometimes attackers use similar commands to search for sensitive files.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events for various DLLs, including mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others related to the .NET framework. Loading these DLLs is normal for PowerShell when running scripts, especially if they're using .NET classes. However, the presence of multiple Image Load events might be a red flag if they're loading unexpected or malicious DLLs. But in this case, the paths seem to be standard system directories, so maybe that's okay.\n\nThere's a File Created event for a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1) in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Then immediately a File Delete event for the same file. Creating and deleting a temporary script could be part of normal operations, like testing or temporary execution. But sometimes attackers create and delete files quickly to avoid detection. However, since it's a PowerShell script and the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" it might be related to testing script execution policies, which is a legitimate activity.\n\nAnother File Created event is for a file named \"estrutura_secundario.txt\" in the Downloads directory. That's a regular text file, so probably not malicious. The other events include winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which is part of the Winlogbeat tool used for log collection, so that's normal.\n\nLooking at the Registry value set events, there's no specific malicious activity mentioned. The tasks are Process Create, Process Access, Image Load, File Create\/Delete, and Pipe Created. These are all standard events, but the frequency of PowerShell activities might be worth noting.\n\nHowever, the key point here is whether there's any suspicious behavior. The PowerShell commands are standard, the DLLs loaded are legitimate, and the files created are either temporary or part of normal operations. There's no indication of malicious activity like connecting to external IPs, executing suspicious commands, or modifying critical system files. The presence of Winlogbeat is normal for monitoring. The only thing that stands out is the temporary script file being created and deleted, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's benign or not. Since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, this might not be a high priority for investigation. But maybe the repeated PowerShell activities and file operations could be part of a larger pattern that needs further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events described does not contain clear evidence of malicious activity, but there are a few notable points that warrant cautious monitoring:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Legitimate Commands:** The use of `ls -recurse`, `get-childitem -recurse`, and `gci -recurse` are standard PowerShell commands for recursively listing files and directories. These are common in both benign and malicious contexts (e.g., searching for sensitive files).\n   - **Temporary Script File:** A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This could be part of testing PowerShell execution policies (a legitimate activity) or an attempt to execute and obscure a script. However, the name and context suggest it may be benign.\n\n2. **DLL Loads:**\n   - Multiple `.NET`-related DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are loaded. These are standard for PowerShell operations involving .NET assemblies. No unusual or non-standard DLLs are present.\n\n3. **File Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - **Temporary Files:** The creation and deletion of temporary files (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest...`, `estrutura_secundario.txt`) are consistent with normal user or system behavior. However, rapid file creation\/deletion could sometimes be used by attackers to avoid leaving traces.\n   - **Winlogbeat Activity:** The presence of `winlogbeat.exe` creating configuration files is expected if Winlogbeat is being used for log collection\/monitoring.\n\n4. **Registry Activity:**\n   - Registry value changes are not explicitly malicious, but they could indicate configuration changes or attempts to modify system behavior. No specific suspicious keys or values are mentioned.\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **PowerShell Scripting:** While not inherently malicious, frequent PowerShell activity with file manipulation (e.g., creating\/deleting scripts) could be a red flag if paired with other suspicious behavior (e.g., network connections to unknown IPs, execution of obfuscated scripts).\n- **Lack of Context:** Without additional context (e.g., user behavior, network activity, or system changes), it is challenging to determine whether the observed activity is benign or part of a larger attack.\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- **Monitor for Patterns:** Investigate if this activity is part of a larger pattern (e.g., repeated PowerShell use, unusual file operations, or registry changes).\n- **Check for Anomalies:** Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to identify anomalies.\n- **Review Script Content:** If possible, examine the contents of the deleted script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) to determine its purpose.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events themselves do not indicate a confirmed security incident. However, the combination of PowerShell activity and file operations warrants further analysis to rule out potential threats. This batch is **moderately suspicious** but not definitively malicious."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me think about this. The user provided a single event in JSONL format. The event shows that powershell.exe was accessed, and the winlog task is 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)'. The file is None, which might mean no file was involved here.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is interesting. PowerShell is a common tool, but it's also frequently used in attacks. The ProcessAccess rule might indicate that the process was accessed in a way that's noteworthy. However, since there's only one event here, it's hard to tell if there's a pattern. Without more events, like multiple accesses or other related activities, it's unclear if this is malicious. The absence of a file might mean it's just a process access without any file operations. \n\nBut the classification is for the entire batch. Since there's only one event, and it's a single ProcessAccess, maybe it's not enough to be considered interesting. Unless the rule itself is a high-risk indicator, but typically, you'd need more context.
