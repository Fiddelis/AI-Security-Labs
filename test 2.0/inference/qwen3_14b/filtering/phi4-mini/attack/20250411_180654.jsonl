So, I need to analyze these log entries to see if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a PowerShell process creating a file called 'objeto_temporario.txt' in the Downloads folder. That's probably normal, but maybe not. Then, there are several entries about ProcessAccess and Registry value sets from Chrome and PowerShell. A lot of Registry changes might be suspicious, but Chrome doing that could be part of normal operations, like updates or extensions. However, the repetition of Registry events might indicate something.\n\nWait, there's a 'whoami.exe' process running, which is usually used to get the current user's identity. That's normal, but maybe in context with other events, it's part of a larger action. Then, there's a PowerShell command that's executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is definitely a red flag. Keystroke logging is a common technique used by malware to capture sensitive information like passwords. The command line shows that it's saving the log to the TEMP directory, which is a common tactic to hide files temporarily.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of PowerShell loading image files like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are .NET Framework components, so that's normal for PowerShell scripts. But then there's a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so maybe the system is detecting something, but the logs don't show any alerts or blocked actions, just the loading of the DLL.\n\nAnother thing is the creation and deletion of a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest...). The fact that it's created and then deleted might be part of a script execution that's trying to clean up traces. That's a common behavior in malicious scripts to avoid leaving evidence.\n\nAlso, the multiple instances of the same Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script being called from different paths (like C:\\elemento_secundario..., C:\\registro_ativo..., etc.) might indicate that the attacker is trying to execute the same malicious script from various locations, possibly to evade detection or test different paths.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of keystroke logging scripts, multiple registry changes, and the creation\/deletion of temporary files are suspicious. Even though some processes like Chrome and whoami.exe are normal, the combination of these events, especially the PowerShell activities, points towards potential malicious behavior. The justification would be the detection of keystroke logging attempts and suspicious file operations that are commonly associated with malware.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute keystroke logging scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), create\/delete temporary files in sensitive directories, and show repeated registry activity. These behaviors are strongly indicative of malicious activity aimed at data exfiltration.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe creating a pipe. That's normal, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then, the second entry is about loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but sometimes attackers might use it for malicious purposes. However, just loading it might not be enough.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the user's AppData directory for PowerShell's StartupProfileData. That could be normal, but sometimes attackers use startup folders to persist. However, the name here seems like a default one, so maybe not. Then, a registry value set by PowerShell. Registry changes can be a red flag if they're modifying keys related to startup or permissions, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen, conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost is part of Windows, so that's probably normal. The next event is interesting: a process named 'None' executing a remote command with a path that includes 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1'. Wait, that script name sounds like it's related to keystroke logging, which is a common malicious activity. The fact that the process is listed as 'None' might mean that the event is from a source that doesn't have a process name, or maybe it's a system event. But the file path is in a directory that seems to be a common one, but the script name is suspicious.\n\nThen there are several file creations by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log collection, so creating a .yml.new file is probably part of its normal operation. The other files like 'pacote_temporario.txt' and 'entrada_padrao.txt' are just temporary files, which might be normal. However, the presence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: the main red flag is the execution of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' which is commonly used in malware to steal keystrokes. Even though some other events are normal, this one stands out. Also, multiple file creations by PowerShell and other processes might indicate some ongoing activity. The classification should be 'INTERESTING' because of the keystroke logging script being executed, which is a clear sign of potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains an event where a process named 'None' executed a remote command involving 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1', a script commonly associated with keystroke logging (malware). This indicates potential malicious activity, even though other events appear benign.\"\n}"}
