{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing a DNS query, powershell.exe and cmd.exe interacting with the registry. Some of these are normal, like systeminfo being run, which is a standard command to get system details. But then there's a cmd.exe command line that includes reg query on HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Disk\\Enum. That might be checking disk information, but sometimes attackers check the registry for hardware changes or to find storage devices.\n\nLooking further, there's a systeminfo.exe process, which is okay, but then an image loaded event for MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe not a problem. However, later there's a calc.exe process loading urlmon.dll, which is a normal system file. But then there's a Calculator.exe (note the capitalization) loading the same urlmon.dll. Calculator.exe might be a typo or a renamed malicious file. Also, the path is correct, but the name difference could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's WmiPrvSE.exe, which is part of Windows Management Instrumentation. The command line includes -secured and -Embedding, which might be normal, but sometimes attackers use WMI for persistence. The image loaded event for wmiutils.dll is legitimate, though.\n\nThe svchost.exe processes creating event logs (Parameters.evtx and State.evtx) are normal, but svchost can sometimes host malicious processes. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe processes doing registry writes. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, so that's suspicious. Also, the repeated registry value set events for chrome.exe might indicate some automated script or malicious activity.\n\nThe most suspicious part is the Calculator.exe with a different casing than the usual calc.exe. That could be a sign of a malicious process masquerading as a legitimate one. Also, the multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and the unusual process names (like Calculator.exe) might indicate an attack.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events are normal, the combination of unusual process names, multiple registry changes by chrome, and the Calculator.exe discrepancy could be indicative of malicious activity. Therefore, the batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious patterns: 1) chrome.exe performing repeated registry writes (unusual for a browser), 2) Calculator.exe (non-standard casing) loading urlmon.dll (potentially masquerading as legitimate process), 3) cmd.exe executing reg query on Disk\\\\Enum (possible hardware enumeration), 4) PowerShell and cmd.exe interacting with registry in potentially malicious contexts. These combined behaviors suggest possible adversarial activity warranting further investigation.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. The user provided a bunch of JSONL events, and I need to determine if the whole batch is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst event: chrome.exe has an image loaded from a path in Windows Defender's directory. The file is MpOAV.dll. Wait, Windows Defender's files are usually legitimate, but maybe this is a false positive? Or maybe a malicious file masquerading as a legitimate one. But I need to check if the path is correct. The version number here is 4.18.25030.2-0. I should check if that's a real version. If it's not, that could be suspicious. But without knowing the actual versions, maybe it's better to note that this is a legitimate file, but the event is about it being loaded. However, since it's a system process, maybe it's normal.\n\nThen there are multiple events where chrome.exe sets registry values. Registry changes can be benign or malicious. But if it's a browser, maybe it's just updating settings. However, multiple registry changes in a short time might be suspicious. But the user hasn't provided timestamps, so I can't tell the sequence.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log collection, but creating a file in Downloads might be normal if it's part of its setup. However, the filename is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which could be part of configuration. Not sure yet.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creates a file named objeto_padrao.txt. That's a regular text file. Unless it's being used for something malicious, but just creating a text file isn't necessarily bad. Maybe it's part of a script, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe rest of the events are chrome.exe setting registry values again. So, multiple registry changes by chrome.exe. Now, considering that Chrome is a common application, but if it's modifying registry keys that are not typical for Chrome, that could be a red flag. However, without knowing the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to assess. The events just mention \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" but don't specify the key or value. So maybe the system's detection rule is triggering on any registry changes by Chrome, which could be normal or not.\n\nPutting it all together: The first event is about a system file being loaded, which might be normal. The multiple registry changes by Chrome could be normal if the user is doing something that requires registry edits, but if they're abnormal, it could be malicious. However, without more context like the specific registry keys or the timing of events, it's hard to be certain. The other events are about file creation by legitimate processes. \n\nBut wait, the first event's file path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll. Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll is part of the real-time protection. If that's being loaded by chrome.exe, is that normal? Typically, Windows Defender components are loaded by the system or other security processes. If Chrome is loading a Defender DLL, that might be unusual. Maybe a false positive in the detection, or maybe a malicious process impersonating Chrome. Alternatively, maybe it's a legitimate scenario, but it's worth investigating.\n\nConsidering that, the combination of chrome.exe loading a Defender DLL and multiple registry changes might be worth looking into. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these specific events could indicate something suspicious. Therefore, the batch might be classified as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"chrome.exe is loading a Windows Defender DLL (MpOAV.dll) from a system directory, which is unusual for a browser process. Combined with multiple registry modification events by chrome.exe, this suggests potential anomalous behavior warranting further investigation.\"\n}"}
