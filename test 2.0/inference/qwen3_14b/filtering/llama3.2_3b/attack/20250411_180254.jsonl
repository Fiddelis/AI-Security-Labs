The first thing I notice is that there's a process called cmd.exe running with a command line that includes systeminfo and a reg query on the Disk Enum key. That seems a bit suspicious because querying the registry for disk information might be related to hardware enumeration, which is sometimes done by malware to gather system details.\n\nThen there's systeminfo.exe being executed a couple of times. Normally, systeminfo is a legitimate tool, but if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, that could be a red flag. The image load events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are interesting. AMSI is part of Windows Defender's anti-malware capabilities, and MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender as well. If a legitimate process is loading these DLLs, that's normal. But if an attacker is trying to bypass AMSI, they might inject code into these DLLs or load them in an unexpected context.\n\nWait, looking at the events again, the systeminfo.exe process is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. That's odd because systeminfo.exe is a standard tool, and loading those DLLs might not be typical. However, the other image load events include urlmon.dll in calc.exe and Calculator.exe. Calculator.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's loading urlmon.dll, which is related to Internet Explorer's URL handling, that might be normal. However, if there's any unexpected behavior here, like the DLLs being loaded from unusual paths or if there are multiple image loads that don't make sense, that could be a problem.\n\nAlso, there are several registry value set events from svchost.exe, conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, and chrome.exe. svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, but if it's modifying registry values in a suspicious way, that could indicate something malicious. However, without more context on what specific registry keys are being modified, it's hard to tell. Chrome.exe modifying registry values might be part of normal operation, but again, without knowing the specific keys, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together: the initial cmd.exe command with systeminfo and reg query might be benign, like a user checking system information. However, the systeminfo.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll could be part of a legitimate process, but maybe the timing or the combination with other events is suspicious. The presence of multiple image loads and registry modifications might not be enough on their own, but when combined with the initial command, it might suggest an attempt to gather system information and possibly evade detection by interacting with security-related DLLs. However, I'm not entirely sure if this is malicious or just normal system activity. But given the presence of the reg query on Disk Enum and the image loads of security-related DLLs, it's worth investigating further. So I think this batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious activities such as 'cmd.exe' executing 'systeminfo' and querying registry keys under 'HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\Disk\\\\Enum', which may indicate hardware enumeration. Additionally, 'systeminfo.exe' is loading security-related DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), which could suggest evasion techniques or interaction with anti-malware components. These combined actions warrant further investigation.\"\n}"}
