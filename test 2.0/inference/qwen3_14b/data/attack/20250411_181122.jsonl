{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I should look through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first event: powershell.exe loaded MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal because Windows Defender uses that DLL. Maybe not a problem here.\n\nThen there's a powershell command using findstr and select-string to search for passwords in files. That could be a red flag because searching for passwords might indicate someone is trying to find sensitive information. But it's also possible that it's a legitimate script, like a user checking their own files. However, combined with other events, maybe there's more.\n\nNext, several svchost.exe and other processes have registry value set events. That's common for system processes, so not necessarily bad. The Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal too. \n\nThe same powershell command appears again, which might be repetitive. Then there's a file created in the user's AppData directory for PowerShell startup profiles. That could be benign, but sometimes attackers create files here to persist. \n\nMultiple registry events for chrome.exe and other processes might just be normal operations, but a lot of them could be a sign of something. The winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file might be part of a log management tool, but if it's unexpected, that could be an issue. \n\nWait, the key thing here is the powershell command searching for passwords. If this is part of a larger attack, like trying to extract credentials, that's a concern. But if it's a user's own script, maybe not. However, the repetition of the same command and the file creation in AppData might suggest persistence or data exfiltration. \n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple registry changes and process accesses could indicate an attempt to modify system settings or hide activities. But I need to check if there's a clear malicious pattern. \n\nI think the presence of the password search command combined with file creation and registry changes might be worth investigating.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: chrome.exe loaded a file from the Windows Defender directory. Wait, MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that might be legitimate. But why is chrome loading it? Maybe a false positive, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of chrome.exe setting registry values. A lot of them. Maybe that's normal, but if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that could be a red flag. But I need to check if there's any specific suspicious registry keys being modified. The data here doesn't specify the keys, so it's a bit vague.\n\nNext, there are several network connections from chrome.exe. Multiple NetworkConnect events. That's common for browsers, but if there's a pattern or unusual destinations, that's a problem. However, the logs don't mention the destination IPs or domains, so hard to tell.\n\nThen, there's a file created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. That's not unusual, but maybe the file names are relevant. The first one is \"objeto_logico.txt\" and another is \"estrutura_ativo.txt\". These names don't seem malicious, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the fact that powershell is creating files might be normal if the user is doing something, but combined with other events?\n\nThen, there's a DnsQuery event with no process. That could be a sign of something, but maybe it's just a normal DNS query. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the winlogbeat.exe events. Creating a .yml.new file. That's part of configuration, maybe normal during setup. But if it's being created multiple times or with unusual parameters, that could be an issue. However, the event just mentions file creation, which is common.\n\nThen, there's a whoami.exe command. That's a legitimate command to check user identity, so not suspicious on its own.\n\nThe cmd.exe events involve deleting scheduled tasks. The command line shows deleting tasks named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting tasks might be normal if the user is cleaning up, but if these tasks were malicious, that's a sign. However, without knowing what the tasks were doing, it's hard to tell. The command is run with \/f to force deletion, which is standard.\n\nThen, there's a schtasks.exe process creating a task, but the event shows the deletion of \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\". Again, deleting tasks is normal, but the names are a bit generic. Maybe the user is managing tasks, but again, no clear sign of malicious activity.\n\nThe svchost.exe event involves a registry object added or deleted. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, so registry changes here could be normal, but if there's a lot of them, it might be worth looking into.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple registry changes, network connections, and scheduled task deletions. But none of the events point to clearly malicious activity. The chrome.exe loading Defender's DLL might be a false positive. The powershell and cmd activities could be part of normal user operations. The lack of specific details like destination IPs, registry keys, or more context makes it hard to determine if this is a real threat. However, the sheer number of events and the involvement of processes like powershell and cmd in modifying system settings might warrant further investigation. It's not a clear-cut attack, but there's enough suspicious activity that it's worth looking into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Unusual Process Behavior**:\n   - **`chrome.exe` loading `MpOAV.dll`** (a Windows Defender component): While `MpOAV.dll` is legitimate, `chrome.exe` typically does not load Windows Defender modules. This could indicate a false positive (e.g., a malicious file masquerading as a legitimate one) or a misconfigured system.\n\n2. **Excessive Registry Modifications**:\n   - **Multiple `Registry value set` events** by `chrome.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. Frequent registry changes, especially from non-system processes, may indicate configuration tampering or persistence mechanisms (e.g., modifying startup keys).\n\n3. **Scheduled Task Deletion**:\n   - **`cmd.exe` deleting tasks** named `unidade_geral_005_OnLogon` and `unidade_comum_005_OnStartup`. While task deletion is normal, the names suggest a pattern (e.g., \"unidade_XX\" could be part of a naming scheme for malicious tasks). Deleting tasks without clear justification raises concerns about cleanup of malicious activity.\n\n4. **`schtasks.exe` and `cmd.exe` Usage**:\n   - **`schtasks.exe` deleting a task** (`elemento_base_005_OnLogon`). This aligns with the earlier task deletions, potentially indicating an attempt to remove scheduled malicious payloads.\n\n5. **`powershell.exe` File Creation**:\n   - **Files like `objeto_logico.txt` and `estrutura_ativo.txt`** created in the Downloads folder. While benign on their own, the use of `powershell.exe` for file operations could be part of data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) activity if combined with other behaviors.\n\n6. **`svchost.exe` Registry Changes**:\n   - **\"Registry object added or deleted\"** by `svchost.exe`. `svchost.exe` hosts system services, so unexpected registry changes here may indicate tampering with system services or drivers.\n\n---\n\n### **Normal or Benign Activity**\n- **`winlogbeat.exe` file creation**: Likely part of log configuration or monitoring setup.\n- **`whoami.exe` execution**: A standard diagnostic command to check user context.\n- **`cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` task deletion**: Could be part of legitimate system maintenance (e.g., removing outdated tasks).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n1. **Correlate with Network Traffic**:\n   - Check if `chrome.exe` or `powershell.exe` communicated with suspicious IPs\/domains during the same timeframe.\n   - Analyze DNS queries (e.g., the unattributed `DnsQuery` event) for unusual domains.\n\n2. **Inspect Registry Changes**:\n   - Identify which registry keys were modified by `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe`. Look for changes to startup paths, service configurations, or user-specific settings.\n\n3. **Review Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - Investigate the deleted tasks (`unidade_XX`, `elemento_base_005`) to determine if they were malicious. Check if similar tasks were created or if there are remnants in the system (e.g., in the registry or file system).\n\n4. **Analyze File Contents**:\n   - Examine the contents of files like `objeto_logico.txt` and `estrutura_ativo.txt` to determine if they contain sensitive data or malicious payloads.\n\n5. **Check for Process Injection**:\n   - Investigate if `chrome.exe` or `cmd.exe` were used to inject code into other processes (e.g., via `ImageLoad` events with non-system DLLs).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs show **no definitive signs of a confirmed attack**, but the combination of **excessive registry modifications**, **suspicious process behavior**, and **task deletion** suggests **potential malicious activity** that requires deeper analysis. This could be a **false positive** (e.g., a misconfigured system or benign tool), but the indicators are consistent with **early-stage persistence or cleanup** of a threat. Further investigation is strongly recommended."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: schtasks.exe is deleting a task called \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". That's a bit odd because deleting a scheduled task might be part of a cleanup, but it's worth noting. The command line uses the \/f flag, which forces the deletion without prompting. Maybe that's normal, but sometimes attackers delete tasks to hide their activities.\n\nNext, there's an image loaded event for taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate Windows file, so probably not an issue here. Then svchost.exe and cmd.exe interacting with the registry. Registry changes can be normal, but if there's a pattern, it might indicate something. However, I don't see any obvious malicious registry keys here.\n\nThen there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe and cmd.exe. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. There's a command line that uses wmic to delete processes named notepad.exe. That's strange because wmic is a legacy tool, and using it to delete processes might be part of a malicious script. Also, the command is redirecting output to nul, which could be hiding errors or outputs.\n\nLooking further, there's a WMIC.exe process that's loading several DLLs, including urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. If an attacker is trying to bypass AMSI, that's a red flag. However, just loading these DLLs isn't necessarily malicious, but combined with other actions, it might be suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry values being set. The repetition of these events could indicate automated scripts running. Also, the deletion of user accounts via net user \/del commands. Deleting user accounts might be part of a cleanup, but if done without proper authorization, it's suspicious.\n\nAnother thing is the use of \"net1.exe\" instead of the standard \"net.exe\". That's unusual. The command line has a typo or a different executable name, which could be a sign of a malicious binary masquerading as a legitimate one. That's a potential indicator of compromise.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple process creations involving tools like schtasks, wmic, and net, along with registry modifications and user account deletions. The use of WMIC and the presence of a non-standard net1.exe are suspicious. The deletion of scheduled tasks and user accounts could be part of an attacker's attempt to remove traces of their activities. The frequent use of PowerShell and CMD for these tasks might indicate scripting for persistence or lateral movement.\n\nHowever, some of these actions could be part of legitimate maintenance or troubleshooting. But the combination of these events, especially the use of WMIC, the non-standard executable, and the deletion of user accounts, makes me think this is worth investigating further. The presence of multiple suspicious commands and the use of tools that are often associated with attacks (like WMIC and PowerShell) are indicators that might point to a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a pattern of activities that warrant further investigation due to several suspicious indicators. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activities**\n1. **Scheduled Task Deletion**  \n   - `schtasks.exe` is used to forcefully delete a task named `registro_base_005_OnStartup` with the `\/f` flag. While task deletion can be legitimate, the lack of context (e.g., no prior creation of the task) raises concerns about potential cleanup of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Unusual Use of `wmic.exe`**  \n   - A command (`wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete`) is executed to delete processes named `notepad.exe`. This is highly unusual, as `wmic` is a legacy tool often exploited by attackers for lateral movement or process manipulation. The use of `>nul 2>&1` suppresses output, which may indicate an attempt to hide actions.\n\n3. **Non-Standard Executable**  \n   - The presence of `net1.exe` (instead of the standard `net.exe`) is suspicious. This could indicate a malicious binary masquerading as a legitimate tool, potentially used for unauthorized network operations or user account modifications.\n\n4. **User Account Deletion**  \n   - Commands like `net user \/del \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\"` and `net1.exe user \/del \"tarefa_temporario_Admin\"` suggest the deletion of user accounts. While this might be part of a legitimate cleanup, the combination with other suspicious activities (e.g., `wmic`, `net1.exe`) raises concerns about unauthorized access or post-compromise cleanup.\n\n5. **Frequent PowerShell and CMD Usage**  \n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` executing commands (e.g., registry modifications, user deletions) are common in attack chains. The repetition of these commands may indicate automated scripts or persistent mechanisms.\n\n6. **WMIC DLL Loading**  \n   - `WMIC.exe` loading DLLs like `urlmon.dll` (used for web requests) and `amsi.dll` (related to Windows Defender) could signal attempts to bypass security features (e.g., AMSI) or execute remote operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Potential Compromise**\n- **Command-Line Obfuscation**: Use of `>nul 2>&1` to suppress output.  \n- **Legacy Tool Exploitation**: Reliance on `wmic` and `net1.exe`, which are often associated with malicious activity.  \n- **User Account Manipulation**: Deletion of user accounts without clear justification.  \n- **Lack of Context**: No apparent legitimate reason for the observed actions (e.g., no prior task creation, no audit logs for user deletions).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Investigate the `net1.exe` Executable**: Verify its legitimacy via file hashing and digital signatures.  \n- **Review System Logs**: Check for additional context (e.g., user accounts deleted, task creation times).  \n- **Monitor PowerShell\/CMD Activity**: Use logging tools (e.g., PowerShell Transcripting, Sysmon) to capture command-line arguments.  \n- **Check for AMSI Bypass**: Analyze memory dumps of `WMIC.exe` to confirm if AMSI is disabled.  \n- **Audit User Account Changes**: Correlate account deletions with login events to detect unauthorized access.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combination of unusual tool usage, user account deletions, and suppression of command output strongly suggests this may be part of a post-compromise cleanup or lateral movement attempt. Further forensic analysis is recommended to confirm whether this represents a security incident.  \n\n**Verdict**: **This batch of logs is suspicious and warrants investigation.**"}

Let me start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are several entries with processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, and whoami.exe. The winlog tasks mention things like Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. Some of the command lines stand out, like the net user commands with \/del \/domain, which seems like deleting user accounts. There's also sc delete win32times, which is deleting a service. \n\nI notice multiple instances of 'net user' commands trying to delete users, which could be part of an attack, maybe trying to remove admin accounts. The use of 'sc delete' suggests someone is trying to remove services, possibly to hide malicious activities. Also, the repeated access to processes and registry changes might indicate someone is trying to modify system settings or escalate privileges.\n\nHowever, some of these processes are normal, like whoami.exe, which just shows user info. But when combined with other suspicious commands, it might be part of a larger attack. The presence of both registry modifications and process creations\/deletions could be signs of a compromise. \n\nI should check if there's a pattern. The same processes are being accessed multiple times, and there are attempts to delete users and services. That seems suspicious. Even though some events are normal, the combination here might indicate malicious activity. So, the classification should be INTERESTING because there are multiple suspicious commands and actions that could be part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including attempts to delete user accounts (net user \/del \/domain), delete services (sc delete win32times), and repeated registry modifications.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a registry value set. That's common, but not necessarily bad. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's deleting temporary files. The command line shows it's trying to delete some files in the Temp directory. That might be normal cleanup, but sometimes attackers delete files to hide their tracks.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe being accessed and registry changes. Then, there's a whoami.exe execution, which is a legitimate command to check user identity, but if it's part of a larger malicious activity, it could be a red flag. However, alone, it's not suspicious.\n\nThen there's a lot of entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. Those might be related to PowerShell's internal processes, but the repetition here could be normal or could indicate something else. However, the key points are the file operations.\n\nWait, there's a file created and then immediately deleted: __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. Creating and deleting a file quickly might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving evidence. Also, the paths in the Temp directory are common places for malware to operate.\n\nAnother thing is the loading of various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET framework, which PowerShell uses, so that's normal. But the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be a sign that the system is trying to scan or detect something, but it's not clear.\n\nThe cmd.exe process also has a command line that deletes files, which could be part of cleanup after an attack. The repeated access to PowerShell and registry changes might be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating and deleting files in the Temp directory, multiple PowerShell activities, and registry changes could indicate malicious behavior. However, some of these actions could be legitimate.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. That's a common tool, but it's also often used in attacks. Let me check the tasks associated with them. There's a \"Pipe Created\" event, which might be normal, but then there's \"Image loaded\" pointing to MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. Wait, that's a legitimate file, so maybe that's okay. Then there's a \"File created\" in the user's AppData folder. Hmm, creating files in AppData could be suspicious if it's not expected, but maybe it's part of normal PowerShell operations. Then there are several \"Registry value set\" events, which could indicate changes to the system configuration. However, some of these are from conhost.exe and svchost.exe, which are normal processes. \n\nThen there are multiple \"Process accessed\" events for powershell.exe. That might be normal, but if it's accessing other processes or being accessed by others, that could be a red flag. But in the logs, it's just \"Process accessed\" without more context. Also, there are entries for whoami.exe being created, which is a standard command to get user info, so that's probably benign. \n\nLooking further, there's a \"File created\" event for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be part of its normal operation. But if that's unexpected, maybe it's an issue. However, the path is in the Downloads folder, which is a common place for users to put files, so maybe that's okay. \n\nThen there's an entry for calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a standard DLL, so that's normal. Similarly, Calculator.exe loading the same DLL. That seems okay too. \n\nNow, considering all the events, the majority are from legitimate processes and standard activities. However, the repeated \"Process accessed\" events for PowerShell might indicate some level of interaction that's not typical. Also, the file creation in AppData and the registry changes could be part of a larger pattern. But without more context, like unusual command lines or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say. \n\nWait, looking at the PowerShell command line: one entry has \"powershell.exe & {}\" which is an empty command. That might be a red flag because it could be a placeholder or a sign of obfuscation. Also, the multiple \"Process accessed\" events might suggest that PowerShell is being used to interact with other processes in a way that's not standard. However, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. \n\nThe presence of multiple \"Registry value set\" events could indicate changes to the registry, which is a common attack vector. But again, without knowing what specific values were changed, it's hard to tell. The fact that some of these are from svchost.exe and other system processes might be normal, but others from PowerShell could be suspicious. \n\nOverall, while there are some potentially suspicious events, they might not be enough on their own to classify this as interesting. However, the combination of PowerShell activity, file creation in user directories, and registry changes could be worth further investigation. But since the user is asking if it's interesting for investigation, I need to see if there's enough to warrant looking into it more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the empty PowerShell command is a sign of something. But I'm not sure. It might be a false positive. Without more data, like network connections or other processes, it's hard to say. But given that there are a few suspicious points, even if they're not conclusive, it might be worth flagging as interesting for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of legitimate system activity and potentially suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Empty Command**: The event `powershell.exe & {}` (an empty command) is unusual and could indicate obfuscation or placeholder activity, often seen in malicious scripts.\n   - **Frequent \"Process Accessed\" Events**: Repeated `Process accessed` events for `powershell.exe` may suggest PowerShell is being used to interact with other processes, which could be part of a larger malicious workflow (e.g., process injection).\n\n2. **File Creation in User Directories**:\n   - A file created in the user's `AppData` folder (`C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`) could be benign (e.g., temporary files), but the lack of context (e.g., file content, owner) raises questions. If this file is unexpected, it may indicate persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events from `powershell.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, and `svchost.exe` could signal configuration changes. While some are normal, others (e.g., from PowerShell) may indicate tampering with system settings or user profiles.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Configuration File**:\n   - The creation of `winlogbeat.yml.new` in the `Downloads` folder might be part of a legitimate setup, but if Winlogbeat is not expected to be installed, this could indicate unauthorized configuration changes.\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **Standard Processes**: Events involving `calc.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `notepad.exe`, and `urlmon.dll` are typical and align with normal system operations.\n- **Windows Defender**: The loading of `MpClient.dll` is a legitimate component of Windows Defender.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the majority of events are normal, the combination of **unusual PowerShell commands**, **file creation in sensitive directories**, and **registry modifications** without clear context **raises red flags**. These patterns could indicate:\n- **Malicious Use of PowerShell** (e.g., for command-and-control, data exfiltration).\n- **Persistence Mechanisms** (e.g., registry changes for startup entries).\n- **Unwanted Software Installation** (e.g., Winlogbeat configuration file).\n\n### **Recommendation**\nThis batch should be **flagged for further investigation**, including:\n- Correlating with network traffic (e.g., DNS queries, outbound connections).\n- Checking file hashes of created files (e.g., `winlogbeat.yml.new`).\n- Reviewing PowerShell logs for obfuscation or unusual script execution.\n- Auditing registry changes for unauthorized modifications.\n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation** due to the combination of suspicious PowerShell activity and potential indicators of compromise."}
