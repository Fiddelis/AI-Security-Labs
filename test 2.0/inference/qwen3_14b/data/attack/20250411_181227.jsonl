{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple entries with PowerShell commands. The command lines are similar, all using ScheduledTask cmdlets to create tasks that run calc.exe. The triggers are set to run at logon, and the principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with the highest run level. That's a red flag because typically, scheduled tasks running as administrators with high privileges could be a sign of something malicious, especially if they're triggering calc.exe, which is a common test application but might be used here as a payload.\n\nNow, the task names are things like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. These might be obfuscated or named in a way to avoid detection. The repetition of similar commands across multiple events suggests that this isn't a one-off occurrence but part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen, looking at the other events, there are several \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed\" events related to PowerShell. Also, there are entries about image loading, which includes .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. While these are legitimate, the combination with the scheduled task creation might indicate that PowerShell is being used to execute scripts that are part of a larger attack, possibly for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThe presence of multiple scheduled tasks being registered with administrative privileges is concerning. Even though calc.exe is a harmless example, the method used here could be a precursor to running more malicious payloads. The fact that these tasks are being created at logon could mean the attacker is ensuring their code runs every time the user logs in, which is a classic persistence technique.\n\nAlso, the logs show that PowerShell is involved in multiple events, including image loads and registry changes, which might be part of a larger attack chain. The justification for classifying this as interesting would be the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with high privileges, the use of obfuscated task names, and the involvement of PowerShell in multiple system events that could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **malicious activity** and warrants investigation due to the following red flags:\n\n1. **Suspicious Scheduled Task Creation**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands are creating **scheduled tasks** with the following characteristics:\n     - **Trigger**: \"At logon\" (suggests persistence).\n     - **Action**: Executes `calc.exe` (a common test payload, but could mask more dangerous payloads).\n     - **Principal**: Runs as `BUILTIN\\Administrators` with **highest privileges** (unusual for benign tasks).\n     - **Obfuscated Task Names**: Names like `unidade_ativo`, `tarefa_geral`, etc., may be used to evade detection.\n\n2. **PowerShell-Based Activity**:\n   - Repeated **PowerShell process creation** and **registry modifications** (e.g., `Registry value set`, `Process accessed`) are consistent with script-based attacks.\n   - **Image Load Events** include .NET assemblies (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`), which are legitimate but may indicate PowerShell is being used to execute compiled payloads or obfuscated scripts.\n\n3. **Potential for Privilege Escalation**:\n   - Tasks running as `Administrators` with high integrity could be used to **escalate privileges** or execute arbitrary code in a privileged context.\n\n4. **Lateral Movement or Persistence**:\n   - The pattern of task creation and registry changes may indicate **persistence mechanisms** or **preparation for lateral movement** within the network.\n\n**Conclusion**: This activity is **highly suspicious** and likely part of an attack chain (e.g., initial access, persistence, privilege escalation). Immediate investigation is recommended to determine if this is a **malicious actor** attempting to establish a foothold or **misconfigured systems** (though the latter is less likely given the deliberate obfuscation and privilege use)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a powershell.exe process loading MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal because those are legitimate Defender files. But then there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp folder. The file is a PowerShell script, which might be a red flag. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of an attack to avoid detection.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious. Then, looking at the command_line in one of the events, there's a PowerShell script that's creating a scheduled task to run calc.exe. That's a common example for testing, but if it's being set up with high privileges (like RunLevel Highest) and for the Administrators group, that's suspicious. It might be an attempt to escalate privileges or execute arbitrary code.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome updating its own settings is normal, but if it's done repeatedly or in a way that's unexpected, it could be part of a compromise. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious activity here.\n\nThe later events have \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks with the process field as None. That's concerning because it suggests that commands are being executed without a clear process, which might indicate a remote exploit or a service that's being manipulated.\n\nPutting this all together: the PowerShell activities, especially the scheduled task creation with elevated privileges, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the remote command executions are all signs that could point to a potential security incident. Even though some events are normal (like Defender files), the combination of these actions might indicate an attacker trying to establish persistence or execute commands on the system. So, the batch is interesting and needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including creation of scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, temporary script file creation\/deletion, and potential code execution. Combined with repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events, these indicate possible malicious behavior attempting to establish persistence or execute arbitrary commands.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate process, but loading a DLL from System32 might be normal. However, sometimes attackers use legitimate processes to load malicious DLLs. But I need to check more events.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and registry changes can be normal, but repeated changes might indicate something. However, the file is None here, so maybe just registry activity without file creation.\n\nAnother event is svchost.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. Wait, System32\\Tasks is a common place for scheduled tasks. Creating a file there could be suspicious if it's not a known legitimate file. \"unidade_comum\" doesn't ring a bell; maybe a typo or a malicious file name.\n\nThen there's an entry with process None executing a remote command. That's concerning because if the process is not identified, it might be a sign of something hidden or a log gap. But there are two such entries. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPowerShell.exe creating files in the user's AppData directory. That's common for legitimate scripts, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell for malicious activities. The file names here seem benign, like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive, but maybe that's part of a setup.\n\nAnother PowerShell event with registry value set. Again, normal for some scripts, but maybe part of a larger pattern.\n\nChrome.exe has several events, mostly registry changes and loading DLLs. The DLLs mentioned, like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, are legitimate Windows Defender components. So that's probably normal. However, Chrome doing a lot of registry changes might be unusual, but maybe the user is just using Chrome normally.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. The .yml.new file suggests it's a new configuration, which could be part of an update or setup.\n\nPowerShell creating other text files in Downloads. Again, could be normal user activity, but if there's a pattern of creating multiple files, maybe something else.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: there's a mix of normal activities and some potentially suspicious events. The svchost creating a file in System32\\Tasks might be a red flag. The process None executing remote commands is also suspicious. However, without more context like IP addresses, command details, or other anomalies, it's hard to be certain. But the presence of a few suspicious events might warrant further investigation. So, I think the classification is INTERESTING because there are a few events that could indicate potential malicious activity, even if others are normal.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: svchost.exe creating a file in System32\\\\Tasks (unusual for this process), process None executing remote commands (indicative of potential lateral movement), and PowerShell creating files in user directories (could indicate script-based attacks). While some events are legitimate (e.g., Chrome loading AMSI DLL), the combination of these indicators warrants further investigation.\"\n}"}
