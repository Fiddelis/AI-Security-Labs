{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries for chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying the registry. Not sure yet, but maybe benign.\n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. The command line has schtasks \/create with names like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The triggers are on logon and startup, and the actions are running calc.exe. That seems odd because calc.exe is a normal calculator, but creating multiple scheduled tasks with strange names might be a red flag. \n\nAlso, there are entries where schtasks.exe is creating tasks, and svchost.exe is involved in registry changes and file creation in the Tasks directory. The file paths like C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_comum_005_OnLogon look suspicious. Typically, scheduled tasks in System32.Tasks are legitimate, but the names here are in Portuguese and have numbers, which might indicate obfuscation.\n\nAnother point is the use of cmd.exe \/c calc.exe. While calc.exe itself is harmless, using it in this context could be a way to execute other commands. However, the logs don't show any actual malicious payloads here. But the combination of creating multiple tasks with odd names and involving svchost.exe, which is often used by malware, might be concerning.\n\nAlso, the fact that some processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe are accessing the registry and creating files could be part of normal operations, but when combined with the scheduled tasks, it might indicate an attempt to persistently run code. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of downloading files or connecting to external IPs, but from the logs provided, the main suspicious parts are the scheduled tasks with strange names and the involvement of svchost.exe. The justification would be that the batch shows multiple scheduled tasks being created with potentially obfuscated names and the use of svchost.exe, which could be indicative of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious scheduled tasks are created with obfuscated names (e.g., 'elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon'), and svchost.exe is involved in file creation within the Windows Tasks directory.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I'll look through the events to see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are about registry value sets, which is normal for Windows processes. There are entries for svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe. Some of these are common processes, but others like svchost.exe can be tricky because they host various services. However, just seeing registry changes might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nThen, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But I should note that. \n\nLooking further, there's a File created event for 'unidade_ativo.txt' by powershell.exe. Creating a text file isn't necessarily bad, but the name is in Portuguese, which could be a red flag if it's related to something malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother point is the Image loaded events for chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that's probably normal. \n\nThere's also a Process Create event for whoami.exe, which is a standard command-line tool. But then there are multiple Process accessed events for powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but again, it's a common tool. \n\nNow, considering all these events together: the majority are from legitimate processes. However, the combination of multiple registry changes, file creations, and process accesses might indicate some activity. But are there any signs of compromise? The presence of whoami.exe could be part of a normal user action. The file creation by powershell.exe might be benign, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be suspicious. \n\nWait, the key here is that the user is asking if the batch is interesting. The presence of multiple registry modifications and file creations, especially by processes like powershell.exe and chrome.exe, could be part of a larger attack. However, without more context or anomalies (like unexpected network activity, unauthorized access, or unusual commands), it's hard to confirm. \n\nBut looking again, the majority of the events are from chrome.exe and powershell.exe doing things that are sometimes associated with malicious activities. However, since these are common processes, it's not conclusive. The only other thing is the file created by winlogbeat, which might be normal. \n\nHmm. I think the justification here is that while there are multiple events, they don't clearly indicate a security incident. The events are mostly from legitimate processes performing normal activities. Unless there's a specific rule that triggers on these events, but the classification is based on the batch as a whole. Since there's no clear malicious pattern, maybe it's not interesting. But I'm a bit torn because multiple registry changes and file creations could be part of something. However, without more context, it's safer to say it's not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate system processes (e.g., chrome.exe, powershell.exe, svchost.exe) performing normal activities like registry modifications, file creation, and process access. No clear indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior are present in the batch.\"\n}"}
