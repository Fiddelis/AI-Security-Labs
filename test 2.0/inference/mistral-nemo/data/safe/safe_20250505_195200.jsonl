The filenames follow a pattern of \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_XXXXXXXX.js\". This indicates that these are likely script files used by an Office add-in or feature related to Excel and strings.\n\nGiven this information, here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. **Identify the Add-In**: Try to find out which specific add-in or feature is causing this issue. You can check your Office applications for any related settings or features that deal with \"strings\", \"Excel\", and \"OfflineFiles\".\n\n2. **Check for Updates**: Ensure that your Microsoft Office suite is up-to-date with the latest security patches.\n\n3. **Disable Suspicious Add-Ins**: Temporarily disable any add-ins or features related to the patterns observed in the file paths (like \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_XXXXXXXX.js\") and see if the issue persists. You can do this via the Office application's Options\/Preferences > Add-ins section.\n\n4. **Scan for Malware**: Since the issue involves unexpected or excessive file creation, it might be a good idea to run a full system scan using a reputable antivirus\/antimalware tool to rule out any potential malware infection.\n\n5. **Contact Microsoft Support**: If none of the above steps help, consider reaching out to official Microsoft support for further assistance with this issue."}

Each creation event is logged with a unique file path and a hash that seems to represent the file content (possibly SHA-256 hashes).\n\n**File Details:**\n\nAll created files have the following pattern:\n- `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf660747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_<HASH>.js`\n\nWhere `<HASH>` is a unique string representing the file content hash (e.g., `aef46c62bb884550bff84243913f7d89`, `334cdb3cf3ee0c66da1c387122578677`, etc.).\n\n**Timeline:**\nThe creation events spanned over approximately 3 seconds, with each file created almost instantly after the previous one.\n\n**Potential Implications:**\n- This rapid file creation might indicate a software update or patch deployment for Microsoft Office.\n- The files being created could be related to offline language resources (_strings) for the \"Office AI Copilot\" feature, hence the prefix \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\".\n- As these events were logged with the \"File created\" message and no errors or warnings, it suggests that the process completed successfully."}
