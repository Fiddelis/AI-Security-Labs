Multiple instances of PowerShell manipulating file modification dates (`LastWriteTime`) on numerous files with structured paths, along with the usage of `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` and unusual paths suggest potential reconnaissance, data manipulation, or malicious activity attempting to hide its tracks.
