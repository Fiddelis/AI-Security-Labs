{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused for malicious activities. So that's something to keep an eye on, especially if there are other suspicious events linked with it.\n\nNext up is whoami.exe running without any command line arguments. That seems normal because whoami is typically used to display user information. But I'll note it just in case.\n\nAnother powershell.exe access follows, which reinforces the initial point about monitoring PowerShell usage.\n\nThen there's a Registry value set by powershell.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of malicious activities like persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation. This event alone isn't conclusive but combined with others involving powershell.exe, it becomes more concerning.\n\nThe next events involve cmd.exe and sc.exe creating services. The command lines show attempts to create a service (win32times) that executes a script from a non-existing path (c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1). This is a red flag because using 'sc' to create services can be part of persistence techniques, especially when the script file doesn't exist. It suggests an attempt to run malicious scripts on startup.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where services.exe and svchost.exe modify registry values. These processes are typically legitimate, but in this case, they're modifying the registry multiple times, which might indicate something unusual, like creating or altering service entries for persistence or other malicious activities.\n\nThere's also an event where cmd.exe sets a registry value. Again, not inherently suspicious, but when combined with the previous events, it adds to the concern.\n\nConhost.exe and notepad.exe modifying registry values are interesting too. These processes are generally benign, but their use in modifying system configurations could hint at malicious activity if they're part of a broader pattern.\n\nThe Calculator.exe process loading urlmon.dll is notable because while Calculator is innocent, urlmon.dll is related to URL handling and could be linked to malicious activities like downloading files or executing commands. This might indicate that an attacker is using legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe modifying the registry multiple times catches my eye as well. Runtime Broker is part of Windows' UAC and COM functionality; seeing it interact with the registry in this way, especially when combined with other events, raises suspicion.\n\nThere's a file creation event by winlogbeat.exe. That's likely from the ELK stack for log management, so probably not malicious unless there's something unusual about the path or volume of data, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nFinally, ApplicationFrameHost.exe and another Calculator.exe event also modifying registry values round out the logs.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple attempts to create services with non-existent scripts, repeated registry modifications by various processes (some known for malicious activities), use of PowerShell, cmd, and other legitimate tools in ways that suggest persistence or payload execution. These are strong indicators of potential malicious behavior, especially when considering the combination of events rather than isolated incidents.\n\nSo yes, this batch is definitely interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"The logs contain multiple instances of potentially suspicious activities such as repeated registry modifications by processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe, attempts to create services with non-existent scripts, and the use of legitimate tools in ways that could indicate malicious intent.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. So, I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The output should be a single classification as either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING along with a concise justification.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few lines:\n\n1. Process: chrome.exe, Task: Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent), File: None\n2. Same as above repeated several times.\n3. Then another line where chrome.exe loads a file: C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll\n4. Another one loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender.\n5. Lastly, powershell.exe accessed a process, but no file specified.\n\nSo, breaking this down:\n\n- Chrome.exe is setting registry values multiple times. Registry changes can be part of normal operation for applications, especially during updates or configuration changes. However, repeated writes could be suspicious if they're unusual for the user's behavior.\n  \n- Then, chrome.exe loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Amsi.dll is related to Windows Anti-Malware Scan Interface; it's part of how Windows scans files for malware. MpOAV.dll is from Microsoft Defender, handling on-access scanning. It's normal for legitimate software to load these DLLs.\n  \n- The powershell.exe event: Powershell is a powerful tool often used by both admins and attackers. A process access event could be benign or malicious. Without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nConsidering all events together:\n\nThe batch shows multiple registry writes by chrome.exe, which might indicate some configuration changes. Then, loading of defender-related DLLs seems normal. The powershell event adds a bit of intrigue because it's commonly used for scripting and can be abused.\n\nHowever, none of these actions on their own are definitive signs of malicious activity. The repeated registry writes could be part of an update or legitimate script execution. The loaded DLLs don't raise red flags as they're standard Windows components. The powershell process access might not be suspicious unless there's evidence of malicious code execution.\n\nSince no clear indicators of compromise (like unusual file creation, network communication, known malware hashes) are present, the batch doesn't strongly indicate malicious behavior. It's possible that these events are part of normal system operations or user activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal process activity with chrome.exe making registry changes and loading standard DLLs, along with a powershell process access. No clear signs of malicious behavior are present.\"\n}\n```"}
