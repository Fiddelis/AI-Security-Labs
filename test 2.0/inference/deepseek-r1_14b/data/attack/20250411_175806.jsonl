{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break down each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where PowerShell.exe is accessed or used. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be a tool for both legitimate administration and malicious activities like executing scripts or commands. The fact that it's accessed several times suggests potential activity worth looking into.\n\nNext, I see instances where cmd.exe, reg.exe, and other command-line tools are being used to modify the registry. Specifically, they're adding values under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This is concerning because adding entries there typically causes programs to run at startup. If these commands are part of a script or batch file, it could indicate an attempt to persist malicious software across reboots.\n\nThere's also a mention of files being created by powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe. The path for the PowerShell-created file is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\modulo_padrao.txt. I wonder if this file was created maliciously or as part of legitimate system operations. Similarly, the winlogbeat.yml.new file might be related to log management, but it's worth checking if these files are expected and safe.\n\nThe combination of using PowerShell with registry modifications is a common tactic in attacks. Attackers often use such tools to gain persistence, hide their tracks, or deploy malware. The multiple registry changes could indicate an attempt to install malicious software that starts at boot without user knowledge.\n\nI also notice the user account involved (fiddelis) and the paths being accessed. If this user is a regular user on the system, elevated privileges aren't expected for these actions, which raises suspicion about potential unauthorized access or privilege escalation.\n\nIn summary, the repeated use of PowerShell, cmd.exe, and reg.exe with registry modifications and file creation points towards possible malicious activity aimed at persistence and system compromise. This makes the batch highly relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing the system, cmd.exe modifying the registry to add startup entries, and file creation activities suggest potential malicious behavior aimed at persistence.\"\n}\n```"}
