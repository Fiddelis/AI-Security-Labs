{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial events, there are several instances where 'chrome.exe' is involved with network connections and DNS queries. That seems pretty normal because Chrome does a lot of networking and DNS lookups when browsing the web. So those might just be regular user activity.\n\nNext, I see some events related to 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to pay attention here. The command line in one event shows powershell.exe with a script that includes commands like ls -recurse and get-childitem. Those are directory listing commands, which by themselves aren't suspicious, but when combined with other actions, they could be part of reconnaissance or data exfiltration.\n\nThen there's a file creation and subsequent deletion of a PowerShell script in the Temporary folder. Creating and then deleting scripts quickly might be an attempt to avoid detection, which is a red flag. Malicious actors often clean up their tracks by deleting files they create temporarily.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe accesses processes, sets registry values, and loads various DLLs. While some of these actions are normal for PowerShell (like loading necessary libraries), the repeated process access and registry modifications might indicate privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe events also show that the same PowerShell command is run multiple times, which could be an attempt to ensure persistence across reboots or to repeatedly execute malicious code. Additionally, the pipe created by powershell.exe could be a communication channel for lateral movement within a network, which is definitely concerning.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows a series of actions that, while individually not too alarming, when combined suggest potential malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell with potentially malicious command lines, coupled with file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, raises the suspicion that this could be part of an attack chain aimed at establishing persistence or exfiltrating data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts, including file creation and deletion in temporary folders, which may indicate suspicious activity such as script execution and cleanup attempts.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from powershell.exe performing various tasks like loading images, creating files, and accessing registry values. Powershell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so I need to be cautious here. The fact that it's accessing multiple files and registry entries could be a red flag, but sometimes legitimate scripts use these too.\n\nNext, I notice winlogbeat.exe creating files in the data directory. Winlogbeat is an agent for log management, so this seems normal unless there's something suspicious about the file names or paths. The .winlogbeat.yml.new file doesn't immediately raise concerns, but it's worth keeping an eye on if there are multiple such entries.\n\nThere are a few events where svchost.exe is accessing registry values. Svchost is a common Windows process that can be legitimate, but it's also sometimes used by malware to hide processes. However, without more context like unusual file associations or network activity, this might not be alarming on its own.\n\nLooking further down, services.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are also modifying the registry. Services.exe is part of the service control manager, so that's expected behavior. RuntimeBroker relates to user profiles, which is normal too.\n\nThen there are multiple User Account Management events without a process name, which could indicate system logon or profile activities, but again, this is pretty standard unless combined with other signs like failed logins or policy changes.\n\nNotably, towards the end, notepad.exe modifies a registry value. Notepad isn't typically involved in such operations, so that's a bit odd. Maybe it's part of some script execution, but I'm not sure if that's malicious.\n\nPutting this all together: there are multiple powershell executions with various actions and some registry modifications by different processes. While powershell is often used for attacks, without specific indicators like known malicious scripts or unusual network traffic, it's hard to say definitively. The winlogbeat activities seem normal, but the repeated svchost.exe and services.exe entries might be worth monitoring.\n\nThe notepad.exe activity stands out more because it's unexpected. Maybe someone is using it to execute commands via a script, which could be malicious. But without seeing the exact command lines or other events, I can't be certain.\n\nOverall, there are enough red flags with powershell and unexpected process activities that this batch should be considered interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe performing file operations and registry modifications, which may indicate malicious activity. Additionally, there are several entries from svchost.exe modifying the registry, and notepad.exe making a registry change, which could be unusual behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event involves the process \"calc.exe\" with a task indicating that an image was loaded. The file path points to urlmon.dll in the System32 directory. I know that calc.exe is typically innocent, but sometimes malware can masquerade as legitimate processes or load malicious DLLs. However, urlmon.dll is a known Windows system file responsible for handling URL operations, so this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nMoving on to the second event: \"svchost.exe\" is involved here, and it's setting a registry value. SvcHost is a common process in Windows that runs services, but malicious actors sometimes abuse it. Registry modifications can be a red flag because attackers often create or modify registry keys for persistence or other purposes. However, legitimate system processes also make changes to the registry frequently.\n\nThe third event repeats the second one: another svchost.exe setting a registry value. This repetition could be concerning. If multiple instances of svchost are making registry changes, especially in quick succession, it might indicate some automated or malicious activity trying to establish persistence across reboots or spread out commands.\n\nLooking at the fourth event again: Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Similar to the first event, this seems a bit off because I associate Calculator.exe with benign purposes. Loading a system DLL isn't inherently bad, but if it's happening alongside other events, especially involving svchost.exe and multiple registry writes, it might be part of a pattern.\n\nNow, considering all these events together:\n\n1. Two instances where svchost.exe is setting registry values. Since svchost can run multiple services, each instance could be legitimate, but the fact that two separate events do this might raise an eyebrow. It's worth checking if these are expected system processes or if they're part of a known malicious activity.\n\n2. Both calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. While these files are common, the combination with the registry changes from svchost could imply some kind of lateral movement or setup for further attacks. Malware often uses legitimate tools like calculators as part of their TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures).\n\n3. The repetition in events: two instances of svchost modifying the registry and two different processes loading urlmon.dll. Repetition can sometimes indicate a script or automated tool being used, which might be malicious.\n\n4. Possible correlation between these activities: Could it be that an attacker is using multiple methods to establish persistence (registry changes) while also trying to execute malicious code through legitimate-looking processes? This would make the batch more concerning as it shows potential for a coordinated attack.\n\nHowever, on the flip side, each individual event might not be suspicious enough. SvcHost modifying the registry can happen during normal system operations, especially if installing or updating software. Similarly, calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading DLLs could be part of legitimate processes, like debugging tools or legitimate scripts running in the background.\n\nBut when these events combine—multiple registry writes, multiple process loads of a system DLL—it starts to look more suspicious. The number of events (four total) might not be high, but the repetition and the combination of process types involved could indicate an attack vector.\n\nI should also consider the context: are these processes running at expected times? For example, during normal operation hours or when certain services are active. If this log was captured outside typical business hours, it might raise more flags.\n\nAdditionally, looking into whether urlmon.dll is being loaded for its intended purpose or if there's an unusual number of loads could be important. If both calc.exe and Calculator.exe are loading the same DLL, it might suggest a common payload or script being used across different processes.\n\nIn summary, while each event individually isn't necessarily alarming, their combination—especially multiple registry writes by svchost and multiple process loads of urlmon.dll—presents a pattern that could indicate malicious activity. This makes the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe, potentially indicating persistence mechanisms, along with multiple processes loading urlmon.dll, which may suggest malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
