Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. While these are common activities for a browser, having several in quick succession might be worth looking into, but on their own they're not necessarily suspicious unless there's something unusual about the URLs or patterns.\n\nNext, there are events involving powershell.exe. The command lines show that Powershell is downloading files from various GitHub repositories. For example:\n- One line shows a download to `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\modulo_padrao.txt`.\n- Another attempts to create and then delete a script file, which could be an attempt to execute code or test permissions.\n\nPowershell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be a vector for malicious activities. The repeated downloads from different repositories might indicate multiple modules being fetched, possibly part of a larger script execution. The deletion of the downloaded script shortly after creation could suggest an attempt to avoid detection by leaving no trace on disk, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nAdditionally, several events show that Powershell is accessing registry values and loading various system files, which can be normal for scripts but might also be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple instances of Powershell downloading files from external sources, creating temporary script files, and deleting them could indicate malicious activity. The repeated pattern suggests automated behavior, possibly a script being executed to download and execute code, which is a red flag for potential attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe downloading files from various GitHub repositories and creating\/deleting temporary files suggest potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this batch of system log events. I'm looking for anything that stands out as potentially malicious or suspicious.\n\nFirst, several entries show `powershell.exe` being used with command lines that download files from GitHub. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often abused by attackers for executing scripts and downloading malware. The fact that it's fetching files from raw.githubusercontent.com might be part of an attempt to bring in malicious code or tools.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances where `powershell.exe` creates files in the user's directory, like `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads`. This could indicate that the script is writing or dropping files on the system, which is a common step in an attack chain.\n\nAdditionally, I notice several registry value sets and process accesses. These activities are often used by malware to maintain persistence or manipulate other processes, which adds to the suspicion.\n\nWhile there are also entries from `chrome.exe` modifying the registry, this might be normal browser behavior, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it's worth monitoring. The DNS query and file creations related to `winlogbeat.exe` seem benign, possibly from legitimate software like ELK stack for log management.\n\nTaking all these points into account, especially the repeated use of PowerShell to download files and interact with system resources, this batch shows concerning behavior that could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes are downloading files from GitHub repositories and creating files in user directories, which may indicate potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal because those are standard Windows processes. Next, svchost.exe setting registry values—svchost is a legitimate process often associated with services, so that's not unusual either. I notice this happens multiple times with different events involving svchost and other processes like Calculator.exe and powershell.exe.\n\nThen there are several instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated access could be a red flag. Also, the command lines for some cmd.exe and schtasks.exe entries stand out. For example, one cmd.exe command deletes a task named 'spawn' using SCHTASKS \/Delete, which might indicate an attempt to remove scheduled tasks that are running malicious scripts.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple deletions from the Registry under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. These entries are often used by malware to ensure persistence across reboots, so deleting them could be either part of a cleanup routine or an attempt to remove malicious payloads.\n\nThe use of reg.exe to delete registry keys is another point to consider. Malware might create registry entries for persistence, and using reg.exe to delete them suggests some process is trying to clean up traces, possibly indicating active malicious behavior.\n\nAdditionally, the repeated creation and deletion of processes like whoami.exe, conhost.exe, and cmd.exe with specific command lines could be indicative of script execution or automated tasks that might have malicious intent. The consistent use of 'nul' in command lines suggests output is being suppressed, which is common in scripts to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of registry modifications, deletion of scheduled tasks, and the use of powershell.exe with specific commands raises suspicions. These activities could be part of an attack chain where malware is trying to remove traces or disable security mechanisms. The repetitive nature of these events across multiple processes strengthens the case that this batch is not just noise but potentially indicative of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of registry modifications, process creations, and deletions, including attempts to remove scheduled tasks (e.g., SCHTASKS \/Delete) and registry entries related to persistence mechanisms.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. \n\nLooking at the events, I notice that powershell.exe is involved in multiple entries. PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement because it's built-in and has legitimate uses, making it harder to detect malicious activities.\n\nI see several 'ProcessCreate' and 'RegistryEvent' tasks related to powershell.exe. These could be normal administrative tasks or part of an attack. The repeated use of powershell with command lines like '& {}' might indicate script execution. Additionally, there's a file creation and deletion in the Temp directory: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1'. This naming suggests it's related to PowerShell scripts, possibly testing policy settings or creating temporary files.\n\nThe creation of this script file followed by its deletion is concerning because attackers often clean up traces of their activity. The fact that the same user 'fiddelis' is involved in these actions could be a red flag if no legitimate reason exists for such operations.\n\nMoreover, there are multiple ImageLoad events showing powershell.exe loading various .NET and Microsoft DLLs. While this is normal, it's worth monitoring if these modules are being used in an unusual way.\n\nI also notice that some entries have 'None' for the file path, which might mean no direct file interaction was logged, leaving room for other actions like registry manipulation or network activities not captured here.\n\nWhile individual events could be benign, the combination of multiple powershell.exe activities—process creations, script execution in Temp directory, and deletion—raises suspicion. This pattern is often seen in attacks where adversaries use PowerShell for persistence or to execute malicious scripts.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst event shows whoami.exe being executed. That's a common system command used to get user information. Nothing suspicious here on its own.\n\nNext is powershell.exe accessed. PowerShell is widely used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I'll keep an eye out for how it's being used.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe starting with an empty \/c flag. The command line seems incomplete or maybe a typo? Not sure yet, but cmd is another tool that can be misused.\n\nAnother powershell.exe access follows. Still, nothing concrete here.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple instances where powershell.exe sets registry values. Modifying the registry isn't inherently bad, but it's often used in persistence mechanisms by malware. This could be a red flag, especially if combined with other actions.\n\nThere are several events of Registry value sets from cmd.exe and conhost.exe. Conhost is usually related to console windows; seeing it interact with the registry might not be common. Maybe trying to hide or alter system settings?\n\nMultiple FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events for a script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. That looks like a PowerShell test script being created and then deleted. This could indicate an attempt to bypass script execution policies, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nAlso, repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks with powershell.exe command lines that just have \"& {}\". Not sure what this signifies exactly, but the repetition might be part of some automated process or persistence routine.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a pattern of PowerShell and cmd activity involving registry modifications and file operations. The script creation and deletion stands out as potentially malicious behavior aimed at testing system policies or deploying malware. This combination suggests possible unauthorized access or attack activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell and cmd.exe activities, including registry modifications, file operations, and script creation\/deletion, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm looking at a batch of system events from various processes. The first thing that catches my eye is the repeated use of powershell.exe and chrome.exe, as well as some other utilities like whoami.exe and conhost.exe.\n\nPowershell being used multiple times with different command lines is a red flag because it's commonly associated with scripting and can be used maliciously for tasks like file deletion or registry modifications. The fact that there are multiple RegistryEvent tasks in powershell suggests something might be tweaking system settings, which isn't typical normal user activity.\n\nLooking at the events, I see several FileCreate and ImageLoad tasks related to powershell.exe. This could indicate it's loading various DLLs, which is standard for scripts but could also mean it's executing commands or downloading modules from elsewhere.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is interesting too. While it can be a legitimate system command, the context in which it's used here makes me think an attacker might be using it to gather user information or check permissions.\n\nAnother point is the multiple PipeCreated events from both chrome.exe and powershell.exe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, but in the hands of malware, they could be a way to establish covert channels or commandeer other processes.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe deletes a .zip file in $env:TEMP. This might be part of an attempt to clean up evidence or download malicious content that gets extracted and executed. The deletion could prevent detection by removing temporary files after use.\n\nThe combination of these activities—multiple registry changes, file creations\/deletions, process access, and powershell command lines with deletions—isn't typical user behavior. It seems like there's a pattern of activity that could be indicative of malicious scripts or tools attempting to establish persistence, gather information, or execute commands on the system.\n\nSo overall, considering all these events together, it does seem like this batch is worth investigating further for potential security issues.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including registry modifications and file operations that may indicate malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm seeing a lot of PowerShell activity here. That alone might be normal because admins often use it, but some patterns could raise flags.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where PowerShell is creating and then deleting files in the Temp directory. They're using commands like Remove-Item to delete zip files and text files. Deleting temporary files isn't unusual, but the specific paths and repeated actions might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the file operations: they create a file named something like __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1, which sounds like it's part of some script testing or maybe an attempt to bypass detection. Then it deletes several files with .zip extensions and others ending in _base.txt or _ativo.txt. These filenames don't ring any bells immediately, but the pattern suggests automated cleanup after something was done.\n\nAlso, there are logs showing registry changes and image loads related to Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That might be normal for defender processes, but it's worth checking if these were triggered by PowerShell.\n\nAnother point is the use of 'whoami.exe', which could be used to check permissions or gather information about the user. It's not inherently bad, but when combined with other actions, it could indicate reconnaissance.\n\nI also notice that several events have \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks in the winlog. These are usually related to resource management, so maybe the script is doing a lot of file operations that trigger these events.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows a PowerShell process performing multiple file deletions and other system interactions. The combination of creating temporary files, deleting various files, registry changes, and using whoami could indicate malicious activity like data exfiltration or installing backdoors. Alternatively, it might be a script cleaning up after itself to avoid detection.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the sequence of actions, especially the file deletions in the Temp directory with .zip and text files, raises questions about what was being deleted and why. It's possible that these could be logs or data that an attacker is trying to remove.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows repeated file deletions from the Temp directory using PowerShell, which may indicate attempts to remove traces of malicious activities.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few logs show powershell.exe being executed with specific commands like Remove-Item to delete files in the TEMP directory. This catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it's deleting multiple files could be part of data exfiltration or system cleanup, which might indicate something suspicious.\n\nNext, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs, includingclr.dll and mscoree.dll. While these are legitimate .NET framework components, in the context of other events like file deletions, it raises a red flag because attackers often use such modules for obfuscation or to execute malicious code.\n\nI notice multiple FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events related to PowerShell scripts in the TEMP directory. Specifically, there's a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 that's created and then deleted shortly after. This behavior is concerning because creating and immediately deleting files can be a tactic used by malware to evade detection or persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further down, there are events where conhost.exe writes to the registry. Conhost is typically associated with legitimate processes like command prompt, but any unexpected registry changes could indicate tampering or persistence attempts.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is executed. While this is a standard user identification tool, its use in conjunction with other suspicious activities might suggest an attempt to gather system information for later attacks.\n\nThe last few events involve the creation of files and processes that don't immediately seem malicious on their own, but combined with the earlier patterns, they contribute to an overall concerning narrative.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of powershell.exe with file deletions, script creations\/deletions, registry modifications, and other process activities points towards potential malicious behavior. These actions could be part of a larger attack campaign aimed at persistence, data theft, or system compromise. Therefore, the batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious activity including file deletions, creation of temporary files, and registry modifications, which may indicate malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line has three main parts: process info, windows log task, and file info.\n\nStarting with the first few lines, they all seem to be from chrome.exe setting registry values. That's pretty common since Chrome often interacts with the Windows registry for settings and extensions. I don't see any immediate red flags there; it looks like normal activity.\n\nThen, there's an entry from RuntimeBroker.exe doing a registry set. Runtime Broker is part of the Windows User Account Control (UAC), so that seems standard too. It might be related to managing app execution or something similar.\n\nNext up are multiple entries from whoami.exe and powershell.exe. Whoami is a basic tool to check user information, which could be part of legitimate scripts or just regular user activity. PowerShell is widely used for system administration but can also be a vector for attacks if used maliciously. However, seeing it accessed or created isn't unusual on its own; admins often use it.\n\nLooking closer at the whoami.exe processes, they all have command lines pointing to \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\", which is the correct path. No signs of being executed from an unexpected location here. The same goes for powershell.exe accesses—they don't show any unusual paths or arguments that would raise a red flag.\n\nThen there's an entry from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory with a .yml.new extension. Winlogbeat is likely part of the ELK stack for log management, so this seems like it's just setting up or updating configuration files. The file path looks legitimate and not indicative of malicious activity.\n\nLastly, there's a powershell.exe creating a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' in the user's Downloads folder. Again, without seeing the content or context of what PowerShell is doing, this could be part of a script or just regular operations. It doesn't seem suspicious at first glance.\n\nPutting it all together: most events are standard system processes performing normal tasks—registry modifications, process creation for legitimate tools, and file creations by monitoring software. There's no evidence of unusual behavior, missing any signs like repeated failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or known malicious file hashes. The repetition might indicate something, but without more context, it doesn't cross into suspicious territory.\n\nSo, I would classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING because there are no clear indicators of malicious activity in the events provided.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The log entries consist of normal system processes such as registry modifications by Chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, process creations for legitimate tools like whoami.exe and powershell.exe, and file operations by monitoring software. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\"\n}"}
