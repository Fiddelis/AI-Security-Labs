{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm looking at a batch of system log events from different processes. The events are in JSONL format, so each line is a separate JSON object.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe accessed something. That's interesting because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Next, whoami.exe was run without any arguments. That seems normal; it's often used to check user information. Then there are multiple events of powershell.exe accessing things again, which could be concerning.\n\nLooking further, I see svchost.exe modifying the registry. Svchost is a legitimate system process, but sometimes malware can hide under its name. Also, another powershell.exe event where it's setting a registry value. That stands out because writing to the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms for malicious software.\n\nThen there are several powershell.exe events with specific command lines. The commands are using Add-Type to load System.Windows.Forms and then capturing the screen into a bitmap file saved in %TEMP%. This looks like it's taking screenshots, which could indicate some form of monitoring or data exfiltration. Running such scripts from PowerShell is a common tactic for attackers to perform surveillance.\n\nMultiple instances of these command lines suggest repeated attempts or perhaps different parts of a script running at the same time. The file paths saved in TEMP are named things like 'unidade_logico.png', which translates to 'logical unit'—maybe part of a broader data collection effort.\n\nAlso, several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various .NET framework DLLs and Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. While normal for PowerShell scripts, the combination with other suspicious activities makes it more concerning.\n\nThe last four events have similar command lines to previous ones but under 'Provider Lifecycle' task. This might be related to service or driver activity, possibly indicating that some components are being loaded or modified.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe running scripts that take screenshots, accessing the registry, and loading various system files. These activities can be signs of malicious behavior like screen recording, data theft, or persistence mechanisms. The repetitive nature suggests an attempt to achieve a specific goal through different means or perhaps different stages of an attack.\n\nSo, overall, this batch is definitely interesting because it shows several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe performing suspicious activities, including taking screenshots and accessing the registry. These actions are indicative of potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of events. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries that detail various system activities. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst off, I notice that there are multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that involve screen capturing. The commands use System.Windows.Forms to capture the screen and save it as a PNG file in the TEMP directory. This seems suspicious because screen recording tools can be used for malicious activities like screenshots for exfiltration or persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking closer, there are several instances where different files are being saved under various names, all within the same TEMP folder. The filenames change each time, but they all end with .png, which aligns with the screen capture functionality. This repetitive behavior could indicate a script running multiple times, possibly trying to gather visual data at intervals.\n\nAnother point of interest is the creation and deletion of specific files related to PowerShell scripts. There's a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1 that gets created and then deleted. This might be part of an attempt to test script execution policies or to hide evidence by deleting temporary files after use.\n\nI also see events where processes like conhost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, chrome.exe are accessing registry values and creating or modifying files. These activities alone aren't necessarily malicious but could be part of a broader campaign if combined with other suspicious behaviors.\n\nMoreover, there are entries related to remote command execution and pipeline events. The 'Execute a Remote Command' task suggests that commands might be running over a network, which is a common indicator of potential remote attacks or lateral movement within a network.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and the sequence of events, it's concerning because multiple high-privilege operations (like screen capturing, file creation\/deletion, registry modifications) are occurring in quick succession. This kind of activity could be indicative of a script running with elevated privileges, which is often used by attackers to maintain persistence or escalate their access.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that these events involve different components and processes (powershell.exe, conhost.exe, etc.) working together might suggest a more complex attack vector, possibly involving multiple stages or tools. The varied file operations and registry changes could be part of an attempt to establish persistence across reboots or to hide traces.\n\nI'm also noting that some events don't have a process name but still log tasks like 'Execute a Remote Command' or 'Pipeline Execution Details.' This absence might indicate background processes or services with higher privileges, which are harder to track and could be used maliciously without direct user interaction.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell command line activities for screen capture, file manipulations that suggest script execution testing, remote command executions, and varied system process interactions points towards potentially malicious behavior. While not every event is definitively malicious on its own, the pattern and volume of these activities are concerning enough to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Repetitive Screen Capture Activity**: Multiple PowerShell commands capture the screen and save images in TEMP. This could be for exfiltration or persistence.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**: A temporary PowerShell script is created and deleted, possibly to test execution policies or erase evidence.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Various processes modify registry values, which might be part of a broader attack strategy.\n\n4. **Remote Command Execution**: Events suggest commands executed over the network, a common attack vector.\n\n5. **Elevated Privilege Operations**: High-privilege actions across different processes raise concerns about potential escalation or persistence.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these activities suggests possible malicious intent. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these events and mitigate risks."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and decide if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see that most are from chrome.exe with tasks like 'Registry value set', which is pretty common for applications accessing system settings. There's also a DNS query and an Image Load task loading some DLLs. The paths for those DLLs look legitimate—amsi.dll is part of Windows, used for anti-malware scanning, so that's expected from a process like chrome.exe. Similarly, the other DLL is related to Windows Defender, which would make sense as well.\n\nNow, I'm considering if any of these actions are unusual or indicate malicious behavior. The repeated Registry value sets might seem suspicious at first glance, but many applications do modify the registry during operation. Also, the DNS query could be part of normal browsing activity. Since all events tie back to chrome.exe and the loaded DLLs are legitimate, there doesn't seem to be any red flags here.\n\nI don't notice anything like file creations in unusual directories, network connections to suspicious domains, or known malicious process spawns. Everything appears consistent with standard Chrome operations, including loading necessary system components.\n\nSo, after reviewing each event and considering their context, I don't see any indicators of malicious activity. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal Chrome operations including registry access, DNS queries, and loading legitimate system DLLs.\"\n}\n```"}
