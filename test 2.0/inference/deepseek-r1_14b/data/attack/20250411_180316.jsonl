{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst off, there are multiple entries from different processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, etc. I notice that several of these processes are performing registry value sets. For example, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exeâ€”all set registry values. That might be normal since many applications interact with the registry for configuration.\n\nThen there's Powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by admins but can also be abused by attackers. However, just seeing it accessing processes doesn't necessarily mean anything suspicious unless it's doing something malicious.\n\nLooking further, I see Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll and another instance of Calculator.exe setting registry values. That seems unusual because the calculator isn't typically expected to modify system configurations or load DLLs beyond its basic operation.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe command that runs \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". Wmic is often used for remote commands, and deleting processes via wmic could be an attempt to terminate running processes. This might indicate malicious activity because it's trying to remove something from the system.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries of WMIC.exe loading various DLLs like urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Loading these modules could be part of legitimate operations, but sometimes attackers use such techniques for persistence or to bypass security mechanisms.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's directory is probably normal if that's part of their log management setup, but I should consider whether it's acting out of place.\n\nAnother point is whoami.exe being executed. While this is a standard command to get user information, its use could be either legitimate or part of reconnaissance by an attacker.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows several red flags: multiple powershell.exe accesses, deletion of processes via wmic, and unusual activity from Calculator.exe. These behaviors could indicate someone trying to hide their tracks, delete evidence, or gain unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activities such as multiple PowerShell accesses, process deletions using WMIC, and unusual behavior from Calculator.exe and other processes.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. I'm trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. So, I'll go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is 'chrome.exe' and the task is 'Registry value set'. This seems normal because Chrome might be updating its settings or extensions. There's nothing immediately suspicious here since browsers often interact with the registry for configuration purposes.\n\nNext, there are several instances of 'powershell.exe' being accessed via different tasks like 'Process accessed'. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both legitimately and maliciously. However, seeing it accessed doesn't necessarily mean it's doing something bad. It could just be running scripts or administrative tasks. But I'll keep an eye out for any suspicious command lines.\n\nLooking further down, there's a process named 'whoami.exe' being created without any command line arguments. Whoami is typically used to display user information, which can be part of legitimate activities but might also indicate recon if used in a sequence of other commands.\n\nThen I spot some 'cmd.exe' processes with specific command lines. One copies a file from sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe, and another deletes a scheduled task using schtasks. The copy command is interesting because it's moving an executable, which could be replacing legitimate system files or creating persistence mechanisms. Also, deleting a scheduled task might be part of cleaning up after malicious activities.\n\nThere are also events where 'schtasks.exe' is used to delete a task named 'win32times'. Scheduled tasks are often targeted by attackers to maintain persistence or disrupt normal operations. This could be part of an attack chain, but without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nAnother event involves 'svchost.exe', which is a common process that hosts various Windows services. However, in some cases, svchost can be exploited, and its activity might indicate malicious behavior. The event here mentions registry changes, so combined with other events, this could be part of an attack vector.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances where 'conhost.exe' interacts with the registry. Conhost is often used for console applications, but again, registry modifications without clear purpose might warrant closer investigation.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual actions like using Chrome or PowerShell aren't suspicious on their own, the combination of activities such as replacing system files (sethc.exe), deleting scheduled tasks, and multiple registry changes across different processes could indicate malicious behavior. These actions are often part of tactics used by attackers to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, or disrupt systems.\n\nTherefore, this batch of events should be considered interesting for further investigation because the cumulative activity shows signs that might be part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including potential file replacement, scheduled task deletion, and registry modifications across processes like PowerShell, cmd.exe, and schtasks.exe. These actions could indicate malicious behavior such as persistence or privilege escalation.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries involving cmd.exe and powershell.exe being used with tasks like 'Registry value set' and 'Process Create'. This is a bit concerning because these tools can be used both benignly and maliciously. For instance, setting registry values without a clear purpose might indicate configuration changes that could be part of an attack.\n\nThen there are multiple instances where chrome.exe is loading various DLLs. While this seems normal for a browser process, I'm paying attention to the specific file paths. The 'amsi.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll' are related to anti-malware scan interfaces and Windows Defender's MpOAV, which are critical for system security. If these files are being loaded by Chrome in an unusual way, it could be a sign of tampering or exploitation.\n\nLooking at the powershell.exe entries, I see several 'Registry value set' tasks, which might be trying to modify system configurations that PowerShell typically uses. Additionally, there's a file creation event for a temporary .ps1 script. This is intriguing because attackers often use such scripts to execute malicious commands that bypass normal execution paths.\n\nThe conhost.exe and whoami.exe processes also catch my eye. These are legitimate utilities, but their use in conjunction with other activities could be part of privilege escalation or information gathering tactics.\n\nWhat's more concerning is the repeated use of these tools without a clear benign purpose. The combination of registry modifications, loading security-related DLLs, creating temporary scripts, and multiple process creations suggests potential malicious activity. These behaviors are often indicative of an attacker trying to establish persistence, gather system information, or execute arbitrary code.\n\nGiven all these points, it's reasonable to flag this batch as interesting for further investigation. The cumulative actions across different processes and file operations point towards possible security incidents that need attention.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of cmd.exe and powershell.exe performing registry modifications, combined with suspicious file creation and DLL loading activities, suggest potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, the logs show multiple instances where powershell.exe is being used. That catches my attention because PowerShell can be a tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first event mentions a file deletion attempt involving a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. File deletions can be part of an attack to cover tracks or remove evidence.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe is called with command lines that seem to check for the existence of certain files (like .bat scripts) in specific directories. This behavior could indicate a script trying to determine if it's running on a system it has access to or if certain conditions are met before proceeding. It's a bit unusual because these checks don't seem immediately suspicious, but repeated checks might be part of a larger script execution.\n\nThere are also entries related to file creation and registry modifications. The File created event from winlogbeat.exe suggests that this might be an agent running logs, which is normal, but the registry changes via PowerShell could be setting persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations maliciously.\n\nAnother point is the use of conhost.exe and whoami.exe. Conhost.exe is often used in command-line environments, and whoami.exe typically returns user information. If these are part of a larger script execution by powershell.exe, it might be attempting to gather system information, which can be an early step in an attack.\n\nThe high number of Provider Lifecycle events from powershell.exe instances could indicate that the script is initializing or terminating modules repeatedly. This repeated activity isn't inherently malicious but could be part of testing or deploying malicious code over time.\n\nPutting this all together, while each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the combination suggests a possible script attempting various checks and actions across multiple files and registry entries. The persistence in checking specific paths and the use of powershell.exe for such activities raises flags about potential malicious intent. Therefore, this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances showing file deletion attempts, repeated checks for specific files, registry modifications, and unusual process activity indicate potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm seeing multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with some command lines that check for the existence of certain files. The first event has a command line that checks if a specific .bat file exists and exits based on that.\n\nThen, there are several events where powershell loads different DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell scripts. But I notice that it's accessing the Windows Defender directory, which might be suspicious because attackers often try to bypass or disrupt security measures.\n\nLooking further, there's a sequence where powershell creates and then deletes a temporary script file. This could be an attempt to execute code without leaving long-term traces, which is a common tactic in malicious activities. The fact that the file is deleted immediately after creation raises my concern.\n\nAlso, there are multiple registry writes from chrome.exe, but since Chrome often modifies the registry for updates or settings, this might not be unusual unless it's doing something out of the ordinary. However, given the other suspicious activity with PowerShell, I'm more focused on that.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated use of powershell.exe with varying command lines that all seem to check for files in different directories. This could indicate a script trying to find if certain malicious files are present or attempting to write them.\n\nThe events where files are created and immediately deleted might be part of a process to test privileges or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, the use of Test-Path cmdlet suggests file presence checking, which is often used by malware to ensure their components are in place before proceeding.\n\nOverall, while some actions could be benign, the combination of creating\/deleting temporary files, accessing security-related directories, and multiple PowerShell executions with varying commands makes this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows repeated PowerShell activity including file creation, deletion, and checks on specific paths.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events and trying to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few events are all from powershell.exe with tasks like 'Registry value set' and no file information. Then there's an event where powershell is creating a new item in the Registry, which seems normal but might be part of malicious activity if done repeatedly or in certain ways.\n\nNext, I see multiple events where powershell.exe is accessing different files, specifically mscoree.dll and other .NET framework components. That doesn't immediately raise a red flag because PowerShell often uses these DLLs for execution. But the fact that it's loading several of them might be worth noting.\n\nLooking further down, there are events with command lines creating batch scripts. The commands in the CommandLine field show that powershell is creating new items and setting content to 'dir'. This seems suspicious because creating multiple batch files named things like 'modulo_secundario_script.bat' and writing 'dir' into them might be a way to execute commands on the system.\n\nThe tasks associated with these events are mostly 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle', which could indicate that something is being set up or configured in the system, possibly for persistence. The repeated creation of files in different directories also raises questions about whether this is part of legitimate script execution or a malicious process trying to establish a foothold.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where a file was created at 'C:\\Users\\...\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1', which might be related to PowerShell testing permissions but could also be a way to bypass certain security policies if executed improperly.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe performing operations that are somewhat unusual: creating and writing to various files, accessing registry values, and loading multiple system DLLs. The repetitive nature of these actions across different paths suggests possible scripting or automated behavior, which might be intended for malicious purposes like creating persistence mechanisms or deploying malware components.\n\nWhile each event on its own isn't necessarily alarming, the combination points towards potential suspicious activity that could warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of JSONL events indicates potential suspicious activity involving powershell.exe. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Registry and File Operations**: Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating registry entries and files, such as batch scripts and a PowerShell script in the Temp directory.\n\n2. **DLL Loadings**: Loading several .NET framework DLLs, which could be part of malicious activities like establishing persistence or executing arbitrary code.\n\n3. **Repetitive Script Creation**: Numerous attempts to create and write to batch files across different directories, possibly indicating an attempt to execute commands or scripts.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of registry modifications, file creations, and DLL loadings suggests potential malicious behavior. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these activities and ensure system integrity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL logs, each representing an event on a system. My task is to analyze all these together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I see that the process name is 'powershell.exe' multiple times. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also commonly abused by attackers because of its scripting capabilities. So that's a red flag right there.\n\nThe tasks logged include things like file deletions, creating files and registry entries. For example, one event shows a File Delete task, which could be part of an attempt to cover tracks or remove evidence. Another event is a File Create for a .bat script in various locations, which seems unusual because why would PowerShell create batch files? Maybe these are being used as persistence mechanisms or to execute malicious commands later.\n\nThere's also a lot of registry activityâ€”specifically, Registry value sets. Attackers often use the registry to store configuration information for malware or to achieve persistence across reboots. The fact that multiple events involve writing to the registry is concerning.\n\nI notice that some of these PowerShell instances are using command lines with complex scripts. For example, one event has a command line that checks if a specific .bat file exists and exits based on that. This behavior seems suspicious because it could be part of an infection process where the script tests if certain files are present before proceeding.\n\nMoreover, there's a lot of Image Load events for various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. While these are legitimate components used by .NET and PowerShell, frequent loading of such modules might indicate that something is using them in an unexpected way, possibly to execute malicious code.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of 'conhost.exe' alongside registry writes. Conhost is a Windows process that hosts console windows for other processes. It's often used by attackers because it doesn't raise as many red flags as PowerShell and can be part of a persistence mechanism or lateral movement within a network.\n\nLooking at all these events together, the combination of multiple file operations (deletion, creation), registry modifications, and the use of PowerShell with complex scripts suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated checks for specific files and the attempts to create batch scripts could be indicators of an attempt to establish persistence or deploy additional malicious components.\n\nI should also consider whether these activities align with normal system behavior. While some PowerShell usage is expected in enterprise environments, especially for administration tasks, the volume and nature of these events seem beyond typical user activity. The focus on creating files in various directories and modifying registry entries points towards an attacker trying to maintain access or spread across systems.\n\nIn summary, the recurring themes of file operations, registry modifications, and PowerShell activities with specific scripts all contribute to a pattern that is concerning. These indicators collectively suggest potential malicious behavior, making this batch of events worthy of further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is deemed **interesting** as it exhibits signs indicative of potential malicious activity.\n\n### Key Indicators:\n1. **Repetitive Use of PowerShell**: Multiple events involve `powershell.exe`, which is often abused for malicious purposes due to its scripting capabilities.\n\n2. **File Operations**: Activities include file deletions, creation of `.bat` scripts in various directories, and attempts to check if certain files exist. These actions could be part of an infection process or attempts to establish persistence.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Several events involve writing to the registry, a common tactic for attackers to store configuration information or achieve persistence across reboots.\n\n4. **Complex Command-Line Arguments**: The use of complex scripts within PowerShell suggests potential malicious intent, possibly indicating efforts to execute harmful commands or test system configurations.\n\n5. **DLL Load Events**: Frequent loading of DLLs like `mscoree.dll` and `clr.dll` might indicate unexpected usage, potentially for executing malicious code.\n\n6. **Use of `conhost.exe`**: This process is often used by attackers to host console windows, sometimes as part of persistence mechanisms or lateral movement within a network.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe combination of file operations, registry modifications, and suspicious PowerShell activities suggests potential malicious behavior. These indicators collectively warrant further investigation to determine the nature and extent of the activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the entire batch of system logs provided is interesting or not. Let me look through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving powershell.exe. That's common because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and for malicious activities. But I'll check the details.\n\nLooking at the first few events: some are about Provider Lifecycle and others mention commands like checking if certain files exist using Test-Path. These seem routine, maybe part of a script checking configurations or files.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe creates a file in the temp directory with a random-looking name. After that, it deletes the same file. This could be a red flag because creating and immediately deleting temporary files might indicate attempts to hide activity or exfiltrate data. However, sometimes scripts do clean up their own files.\n\nAnother event shows whoami.exe being executed, which is typically used to check user permissions. That's not suspicious on its own but could be part of privilege escalation checks.\n\nI also see several Image loaded and Registry value set events for MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, which are parts of Windows Defender. This suggests that the powershell processes might have interacted with these files, possibly during legitimate operations or maybe to bypass detection.\n\nThere's a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is an agent used for collecting logs. That seems normal if it's part of their setup.\n\nLooking overall, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe runs scripts that check for specific files and exit based on their presence. The repeated use of Test-Path and the pattern in the command lines might indicate a script testing various paths across the system. If these paths are related to known malicious activities or if they're accessing areas they shouldn't, it could be suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, the creation and deletion of temporary files without a clear purpose might be an attempt to avoid detection by leaving no trace, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nConsidering all this, while some actions aren't inherently bad, the combinationâ€”especially the repeated testing of file paths across different directories and the temp file handlingâ€”does raise concerns. It's possible that these activities are part of a legitimate script or automated process, but without more context, it's hard to be certain. The potential for malicious intent is there.\n<\/think>\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several characteristics that could indicate potentially malicious activity:\n\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Use:** Multiple events involve powershell.exe, which can be used maliciously. The command lines show repeated use of `Test-Path` to check file existence, often a tactic to ensure persistence or data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion:** Powershell creates temporary files in the temp directory with random names and immediately deletes them. This behavior can indicate attempts to hide activity or avoid leaving traces, common in malware.\n\n3. **Registry and Defender Interactions:** Events show interaction with Windows Defender components (`MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`), possibly indicating efforts to bypass detection mechanisms.\n\n4. **Whoami.exe Execution:** Used to check user permissions, potentially part of privilege escalation checks by malicious actors.\n\n5. **Script Testing Paths:** The repeated testing of various file paths might be attempting to locate sensitive data or system components, a sign of potential unauthorized access.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile some actions could be legitimate, the combination of behaviorsâ€”especially the repeated file checks and temp file handlingâ€”raises concerns about possible malicious intent. Further investigation is warranted to determine if these activities are authorized or pose a security risk.\n\n**Classification:** Potentially suspicious activity requiring further analysis."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's dive into this. I'm given a batch of system log events from various processes, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's powershell.exe being executed with a command that checks if a file exists in a specific path. The command line seems unusual because it's using escaped quotes and a complex path structure. This might indicate some form of file verification or perhaps checking if certain files are present as part of malicious activities.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessed or images are loaded. These could be normal operations since PowerShell often loads various libraries. However, the combination with other events might raise a flag. Notably, there's a FileCreate event for a temporary PowerShell script file and immediately after, it's deleted. This behavior is suspicious because creating and then deleting scripts can be a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point of interest is the use of whoami.exe and cmd.exe with specific command lines. The cmd.exe command checks if a temporary file exists; similar to the earlier powershell.exe commands, this could be part of a larger script or process that's testing for certain conditions on the system.\n\nThe registry value sets in multiple events also stand out. Malware often uses registry modifications to maintain persistence or alter system configurations. The repeated attempts to check and manipulate files and registry entries might suggest an adversary is probing the system's state or attempting to establish persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a series of processes involving powershell.exe performing file checks, creating\/deleting temporary scripts, accessing other processes, loading various images, and modifying the registry. These activities don't definitively prove malicious intent on their own, but they do exhibit behaviors commonly associated with reconnaissance, testing for persistence, or establishing backdoors.\n\nWhile there's no clear evidence of malicious activity in each individual event, the combination raises concerns. The repeated use of powershell.exe with specific commands and the interaction with system files and registry could indicate an ongoing process that might warrant closer examination to ensure there's no underlying threat.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes performing file checks, creating\/deleting temporary scripts, accessing other processes, and modifying the registry.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool for both admins and attackers, so repeated access or execution could be suspicious. Some events show the task as 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)', which means the process was opened or interacted with. Others have tasks like 'Registry value set' and 'Image loaded', which might indicate some activity within the powershell instance.\n\nThen there are whoami.exe executions. This is usually benign, but in a suspicious context, it could be used to check permissions or user information, so I should keep that in mind.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is started with specific command lines. Each command checks if a particular file path exists and exits with 0 if it does, otherwise exits with 1. This pattern seems repetitive but could be part of a script checking for certain files or conditions on the system.\n\nI'm noting that each of these command lines varies slightly in the paths they're testing. This might indicate a script trying multiple locations or perhaps different instances of a script running at different times. The fact that all commands are using powershell.exe and similar structures makes me think there's some automated process or possibly malicious activity trying to check for file presence.\n\nThe last few events have 'Provider Lifecycle' as the task, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's significant. It might be part of normal operations or something else.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell executions with varied command lines checking different file paths could indicate a script trying to locate specific files across various directories. This behavior is concerning because it might be related to file presence checks used in malicious scripts, such as those involved in lateral movement or data exfiltration.

That's part of Windows Defender, so that's normal.\n\nSecond event: PowerShell creates a file in the Temp folder with a random name. This could be suspicious because it's creating a script file.\n\nThird event: The same file created in the second event is deleted. So, the file was created and then deleted quickly. That might indicate an attempt to avoid detection or temporary use.\n\nFourth event: A pipe is created by PowerShell. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but sometimes attackers use them for command execution or lateral movement.\n\nFifth event: PowerShell runs a command checking if a specific .cs file exists. The path seems legitimate, but the pattern of checking files might be part of a larger script.\n\nSixth event: Similar to the fifth, another check on a different .cs file. Repeating checks could be a way to test permissions or presence of certain files.\n\nSeventh event: Loading another Defender-related DLL. Still within expected behavior for PowerShell and Defender.\n\nEighth event: Creating a profile data file in the Startup folder.

This command can show system information but is often used by attackers to gather details.\n\nTwelfth and subsequent events: Multiple instances where PowerShell checks for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts in various paths. The repeated checking suggests a script might be trying to locate or execute another script, which could be malicious. Additionally, the script names include \"Get-Keystrokes\", which sounds like it's meant to capture keystrokesâ€”definitely a red flag for espionage or data theft.\n\nLooking at all these together: multiple file creations and deletions, registry modifications, repeated file existence checks, suspicious script names, and use of whoami.exe. These patterns suggest possible malicious activity, such as testing permissions, creating persistence mechanisms, or preparing to execute payload scripts.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **File Creation and Deletion**: PowerShell creates a temporary file in the Temp folder and then deletes it, which may indicate an attempt to hide evidence or temporarily store data.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: There are multiple instances where the registry is modified, potentially for persistence or privilege escalation, which is often seen in malware activities.\n\n3. **Suspicious Script Checks**: PowerShell repeatedly checks for the existence of \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" scripts across various directories. The script name suggests keylogging capabilities, which are commonly used maliciously to capture sensitive information.\n\n4. **Use of whoami.exe**: This command is executed, which can be used by attackers to gather system information and may precede further malicious actions.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation**: A pipe is created, which can be a method for inter-process communication but may also be exploited for lateral movement or command execution in attacks.\n\n6. **Profile Data File Creation**: A file is created in the Startup folder, possibly indicating an attempt to maintain persistence across system reboots.\n\nConsidering these factors together, it is reasonable to conclude that there are signs of potential malicious activity, such as espionage, data theft, or system compromise.

Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I'm keeping an eye out for anything suspicious here.\n\nLooking at the events, there's a lot of ImageLoad tasks from powershell.exe, which means it's loading various DLLs. This is pretty standard for PowerShell scripts running in different environments, but sometimes attackers use specific DLLs to hide their tracks or execute malicious code. The paths like mscoree.dll and clr.dll are part of the .NET framework, so that doesn't immediately raise a red flag.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe creates and deletes files in temporary directories, such as __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. Temporary script creation is common for testing or configuration purposes, but it could also be part of malicious activity like dropping scripts to disk before execution. The fact that the file was deleted shortly after might indicate an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nAnother point is the command lines in some powershell.exe events checking for the existence of specific .ps1 files in different paths. This could be a script trying to determine if certain directories are accessible or if specific scripts exist, which might be part of reconnaissance or as a prelude to more malicious actions.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe was run, which is often used to gather system information. While this can be benign, it's worth noting because attackers use it too to escalate privileges or move laterally within a network.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries from svchost.exe and Calculator.exe accessing DLLs and registry keys. Svchost.exe is a common Windows process that hosts services, so its activity alone isn't suspicious unless combined with other indicators. The Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll seems normal as it's part of standard system operations.\n\nOverall, while there are no clear signs of malicious activity, the combination of multiple powershell.exe activitiesâ€”file creation\/deletion in temp directories, checking for script existence, and registry accessâ€”along with the use of whoami.exe, could indicate potential malicious behavior. However, these actions could also be part of legitimate system administration or automated processes. Without more context, it's hard to definitively classify this as an attack, but there are enough red flags to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing files and registry keys, creating temporary scripts which were later deleted.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That sounds normal since it's probably the log agent itself writing data. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple powershell.exe entries. PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The events show 'Process accessed' which might indicate it's being used for something, but without more context, I'm not sure if it's bad yet.\n\nI also see whoami.exe being executed. This is a common command to check user information. Since it's just running as is, there's nothing wrong here.\n\nThere are several chrome.exe entries with network connections and DNS queries. Browsers usually do this when accessing websites, so that's expected behavior unless it's connecting to known malicious domains, which I don't see here.\n\nLooking further down, the powershell.exe events start showing registry modifications. 'Registry value set' could be part of legitimate administration or it might be a way for malware to persistence. Additionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs. This can be normal if PowerShell is running scripts that load these libraries, but I should check if any of them are known malicious ones.\n\nThe command line for one powershell.exe is \"& {ls -recurse & get-childitem -recurse & gci -recurse}\". Breaking this down, it looks like a script that lists directories recursively and possibly retrieves child items. This could be part of data collection activities, which might indicate Reconnaissance or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple powershell.exe processes accessing the system, modifying the registry, and loading various DLLs. The command line suggests some form of file and directory traversal, which is a common tactic in attacks to gather information or as part of a payload execution. While individual events might not be suspicious, the combinationâ€”especially the powershell activities with potential script executionâ€”is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell.exe processes accessing system resources and modifying the registry, along with a command line suggesting potential malicious scripting activity.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm looking at each event and trying to see if there's any pattern or signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes. That's common because scripters often use it for both good and bad purposes. But seeing the same process name repeatedly makes me thinkâ€”could this be part of a script execution?\n\nLooking at the first few events: one creates a file in Temp directory with a .ps1 extension, then deletes it, and also there are pipe creations and provider lifecycle tasks. This seems like PowerShell running some scripts or cmdlets.\n\nThe command lines show commands like 'ls -recurse', 'get-childitem', and 'gci'. These are standard directory listing commands but in a loop with '-recurse' which can be part of data gathering, maybe for enumerating files across directories. Could this be part of reconnaissance or file collection?\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created and then deleted, which might indicate a temporary script being dropped and executed, then cleaned up to erase traces.\n\nOther events involve loading MpClient.dll, which is legitimate as it's from Windows Defender, so that seems benign. Then there are registry writes by both PowerShell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nMultiple 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks might indicate repeated script executions or modules being loaded, possibly trying to avoid detection by restarting processes frequently.\n\nAdditionally, creating files in the StartupProfileData directory suggests they're targeting PowerShell profile execution, which can be used for persistence. The download of a .txt file named 'estrutura_secundario.txt' is unusualâ€”maybe it's a custom script or configuration being saved?\n\nThe high number of similar events from the same process over time could indicate automated behavior, possibly part of a larger script that's trying to gather information or perform actions across the system.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple signs point towards potential malicious activity. The repeated PowerShell use with directory traversal, file creation\/deletion, registry changes, and persistence attempts make the batch interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involve powershell.exe creating, deleting, and accessing files, along with registry modifications. These activities could indicate malicious behavior such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\"\n}\n```"}
