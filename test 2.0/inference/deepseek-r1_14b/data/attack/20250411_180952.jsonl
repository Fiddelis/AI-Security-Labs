{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's look through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice there are several entries where the process is \"chrome.exe\" with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of network activity and DNS queries when browsing the web. So that by itself doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and registry events. Powershell can be used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so I need to look at what exactly it's doing here. The tasks include Process accessed and Registry value set. These actions could be part of normal administration tasks, but they might also be indicators of malicious behavior like persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking further down, there are several cmd.exe processes with command lines that involve adding users and groups using net user and net group commands on the domain. This is a bit concerning because these commands can be used to create new users or add them to administrative groups, which could be part of an attack where an attacker is setting up accounts for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nThere's also a process where conhost.exe sets a registry value. Conhost is often related to remote desktop services, but it's sometimes used in attacks for persistence mechanisms or other malicious activities. I should keep this in mind.\n\nAdditionally, there are some file creation events by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe creating files in user directories and system32 folders. The winlogbeat.yml.new file is likely from the ELK stack's winlogbeat agent collecting logs, which is normal. However, the creation of pacote_base.txt by powershell.exe could be suspicious if it's part of malicious script execution.\n\nLooking at the timestamps would help determine if these events are happening in quick succession, which might indicate a session or attack flow. Without that context, I have to assume they're spread out unless there's evidence otherwise.\n\nThe batch includes multiple commands adding users and groups with similar names, like \"pacote_principal_Admin\" and \"modulo_comum_Admin\". The use of temporary passwords like \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" stands out. Attackers often use such predictable or weak passwords for newly created accounts, which could be a sign of compromise.\n\nConsidering all these points together: the creation of multiple admin-level users and groups via command-line tools, suspicious password usage, powershell activity, and registry modificationsâ€”this batch does show signs that might indicate malicious activity. While some events are normal, the combination suggests potential unauthorized access or attack activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple command-line processes creating domain users and adding them to Domain Admins group with weak passwords, along with suspicious powershell.exe activity. These actions may indicate unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts.\"\n}\n```"}
