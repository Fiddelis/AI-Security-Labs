{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where chrome.exe is making network connections and DNS queries. That's pretty normal for a web browser, so nothing unusual there. But then I notice powershell.exe being accessed multiple times with different tasks. Powershell can be used for legitimate purposes but is often associated with attacks because it has strong scripting capabilities.\n\nLooking deeper, one of the powershell.exe events shows a 'Registry value set' task. That's concerning because attackers might use this to modify system configurations or hide their activities. There are also cmd.exe instances running commands like sc.exe create and start. The command lines in these logs look suspiciousâ€”they're creating services with specific names and setting them to auto-start, which is a common technique for persistence.\n\nAnother red flag is the 'Process Create' events involving sc.exe, which is used to manage Windows services. Creating new services without clear justification could indicate malicious activity. Services.exe also modifying registry values repeatedly might be trying to hide or alter system behavior.\n\nThere are several Image Load events from various .exe files loading .NET framework components. While this isn't inherently suspicious, the combination with other activities could suggest that these processes are part of a larger, possibly malicious operation.\n\nPutting it all together, there's evidence of multiple processes (Powershell, cmd, sc.exe) performing actions that could be part of an attack chain: establishing persistence via services, modifying system configurations, and potentially executing code. These patterns don't appear to be normal user activity but align with tactics used in cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple process creations and activities involving Powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and sc.exe, which could indicate potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or service creation. Additionally, repeated registry modifications may suggest attempts to alter system configurations.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads... That seems normal because winlogbeat is likely the log shipping tool, so it's just writing its configuration file or something similar.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe. It's setting registry values and accessing processes. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be a vector for malicious activities. I should keep an eye on that, especially if the commands being run aren't expected.\n\nThen, RuntimeBroker.exe sets a registry value. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows and typically handles runtime events, so unless it's doing something unusual here, it might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nNotepad.exe also sets a registry value. Notepad is a simple text editor; if it's accessing the registry, that could indicate some script execution or perhaps malicious activity, but I need more context.\n\nCalc.exe loads urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate Windows DLL used for URL handling. This seems normal as part of system operations.\n\nSVCHOST.EXE is involved in multiple events where it sets registry values. SVCHOST is a known process that hosts various services, and it's common to see it interact with the registry. However, depending on the specific service, this could be normal or potentially suspicious if it's accessing unexpected areas.\n\nLooking at all these together, most of the activities seem benign except for the powershell.exe events. Powershell is a red flag because it can execute commands and scripts, which can be malicious. The multiple ProcessAccess tasks might indicate that Powershell is exploring other processes, possibly gathering information or trying to elevate privileges.\n\nAdditionally, there are repeated actions by svchost.exe, which could be part of normal service operations but might also signal something more if these services aren't supposed to modify the registry in this context.\n\nIn total, while most events are routine, the presence of Powershell and the repeated registry modifications could indicate potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and setting registry values, which may indicate suspicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
