{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few events are from chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser that does lots of network activity. Nothing suspicious there, I think.\n\nThen there's an entry for powershell.exe accessing something with ProcessAccess. Powershell can be used maliciously, but sometimes it's just regular usage too. I'll keep an eye out for more events involving powershell.exe.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is run. That's a legitimate tool to check user information. Usually not suspicious unless it's part of a larger sequence. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks from powershell.exe. Modifying the registry could be part of malicious activity because attackers often try to persistence or change system configurations.\n\nI notice some ImageLoad events for various DLLs which are normal when processes load libraries. But then there's a FileCreate event for a temporary PowerShell script, __PSScriptPolicyTest_j0wb0i2i.xpe.ps1. Creating temp scripts can be part of malicious behavior to execute code without being detected easily.\n\nThe same file is deleted shortly after, which might indicate an attempt to remove evidence. That's a red flag because attackers often clean up their tracks.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the powershell.exe events, there's some obfuscated code using XOR cipher with a key. The script seems to be encoding plaintext data and sending it over HTTP POST to example.com. Obfuscation is commonly used by malware to hide its activities from detection.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple powershell.exe instances accessing the registry, creating and deleting a temp malicious script, and network activity that looks like exfiltration. This combination suggests potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains events indicating suspicious PowerShell activity including process creation, registry modifications, file operations, and obfuscated network communication. These activities suggest potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, most of the events are PowerShell executions. Each command line looks similar—it's using a script that encrypts some plaintext with a simple XOR cipher and then sends it over HTTP POST to example.com. The fact that it's sending data outside the network is a red flag because attackers often exfiltrate data this way.\n\nThe keys used in XOR here are predictable, like \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456\". Weak encryption might indicate either a test script or maybe an attempt to obfuscate without much effort. The plaintext includes paths and user directories, which could be sensitive information being sent out.\n\nLooking at the events, some have the task as 'Provider Lifecycle' and others as 'Engine Lifecycle'. These relate to Windows Defender components loading images. Then there's a FileCreate event for winlogbeat.yml.new, which is part of the data collection setup, probably not malicious but more about log management.\n\nOne process is winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which I recognize as an ELK stack component—used for log shipping. That's normal if it's part of monitoring infrastructure.\n\nBut circling back to the PowerShell scripts: repeated attempts to send encrypted data using predictable methods could be a sign of malicious activity. The same script running multiple times across different events suggests automation or a script being executed several times, possibly in an attempt to send sensitive information without detection.\n\nThe exfiltration to example.com is concerning because that domain isn't specified as a legitimate one here. Without knowing the context, it's hard to say if it's intended for malicious purposes, but combined with the encryption and path traversal, it raises suspicion.\n\nSo putting it all together: repeated PowerShell executions with XOR-based data transmission, targeting an external domain, plus some normal monitoring processes. The concerning part is the potential exfiltration of sensitive user paths via a weak cipher, which could indicate a breach or attempted data theft.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interested\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The batch includes multiple instances of PowerShell executing a script that sends encrypted data to an external domain. This may indicate data exfiltration. Some events relate to Windows Defender and monitoring tools, but the repeated use of XOR encryption with predictable keys raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see if there's anything that stands out as potentially malicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: I see powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so any activity from it might be worth looking into. But on its own, without more context, it's hard to say if this is bad.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where processes like conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and svchost.exe are modifying the registry. These are all legitimate system processes, but frequent or unusual registry changes can be a sign of malicious activity. I'm noting that these events could be normal, especially during system updates or installations.\n\nThen, there's an event where notepad.exe is making a registry change. Notepad is typically used for text editing, so it's odd to see it interacting with the registry unless it's part of some automated script or configuration process.\n\nLooking at calc.exe and Calculator.exe both loading urlmon.dll—I'm curious about that DLL. URLMON is related to handling URLs and could be involved in legitimate operations, but sometimes malicious actors use such modules for file download or communication purposes. However, since this is a standard Windows system file, it might not be suspicious unless there's an unusual usage pattern.\n\nI also notice several entries from chrome.exe making registry changes and loading specific DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Amsi is related to antivirus scanning, so that seems normal.MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that's expected as well. The repeated registry modifications by chrome could be due to updates or extensions but might also indicate some form of persistence if done excessively.\n\nThere are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses other processes (ProcessAccess). This could be legitimate administration activity, but it can also be a way for attackers to elevate privileges or spread within a network. The frequency here is notable and raises an eyebrow.\n\nAnother point is the repeated registry changes by various processes. If this were a single instance, it might not be concerning, but multiple such events across different processes could indicate a broader pattern of malicious activity, like installing backdoors or persistence mechanisms.\n\nLastly, there are file creation events from winlogbeat.exe, which I assume is part of log management software. However, if this is creating files in user directories, especially with non-standard names, it might be worth investigating to ensure no unauthorized data exfiltration is occurring.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows several red flags. Powershell's activity, process accesses, and the high number of registry modifications across different processes are concerning. While some activities could be benign, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe, process access attempts, and numerous registry modifications, which together indicate possible malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm seeing multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with specific commands that remove files in different directories. These commands are using the Remove-Item cmdlet to delete files without any apparent reason provided. The fact that these deletions are happening across various paths and using \"&\" to chain commands might indicate scripting activity, which could be malicious.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file being created and then immediately deleted by PowerShell. This temporary file creation and deletion is often a tactic used in malware to avoid detection or to execute code without leaving long-term traces on the system. The use of \"-Force\" and \"-ErrorAction Ignore\" suggests that the script is trying to remove files without user interference, which could be a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are several registry modifications from both PowerShell and Chrome. While Chrome sometimes makes registry changes during normal operation, the frequency here seems high and might warrant investigation. The combination of these events—multiple file deletions, temporary file operations, and registry changes—points towards potential malicious activity.\n\nSo, considering all these factors together, this batch does seem interesting for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are performing file deletions across different paths without clear justification.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is 'powershell.exe' with command lines that involve deleting files using Remove-Item. The paths in these commands seem to be pointing to various script files (bat) in different directories. This could be suspicious because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities. Deleting scripts might indicate an attempt to remove evidence or disrupt system operations.\n\nThen, there are events where 'powershell.exe' is involved in other tasks like loading images, creating processes, accessing registry values, etc. These actions alone aren't necessarily bad, but when combined with the deletion of files, they could be part of a larger script or malicious activity.\n\nI also see entries for 'cmd.exe' executing commands like stopping and deleting services via sc.exe. Using command-line tools to manage services can be part of normal administrative tasks, but again, when combined with other suspicious activities, it raises flags.\n\nLooking at the types of events in winlog: Provider Lifecycle, Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, Process Create, etc. These are common events during system operations, so they don't immediately indicate something wrong. However, the combination of these events along with the file deletions and service management might be worth investigating.\n\nAnother point is that some events involve registry changes. Malware often modifies the registry to maintain persistence or alter system configurations. The multiple RegistryEvent tasks could be part of such activities.\n\nThere's also an event where 'whoami.exe' is executed, which is typically used to get user information. This might be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts if combined with other actions.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple instances of PowerShell deleting scripts, using cmd to stop and delete services, registry modifications, and process creations. These could indicate a script running with elevated privileges trying to clean up traces or disable security mechanisms. The pattern suggests potential malicious activity aimed at persistence, data exfiltration, or system compromise.\n\nTherefore, the batch is interesting because it shows a sequence of actions that together might be part of an attack chain, such as initial access, execution, and cleanup.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell commands deleting files, use of cmd.exe to manage services, registry modifications, and other activities that together suggest potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is a command prompt (cmd.exe) deleting a file in the temp directory. That might be suspicious because deleting files can hide traces, but it's not necessarily malicious yet.\n\nNext, there are several events involving powershell.exe being accessed or creating processes. Powershell is often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement, so repeated access could be a red flag. Also, the fact that it's accessing registry values multiple times might indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or gather information.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process. While this can be benign (used to check user permissions), in some cases, it might be part of privilege escalation attempts.\n\nLooking further, I see powershell.exe creating and then deleting a file in the temp directory. This is concerning because creating and immediately deleting files could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or delete logs to cover tracks.\n\nThere are also events where winlogbeat.exe creates a configuration file. Winlogbeat is usually for log management, so this might not be suspicious on its own unless it's part of a larger activity.\n\nMultiple Provider Lifecycle events with powershell.exe command lines that just execute an empty script could indicate scripting activities. Empty scripts in PowerShell are often used to test permissions or as a precursor to executing other commands.\n\nPutting it all together: cmd.exe deleting files, multiple registry accesses, whoami usage, file creation\/deletion in temp by powershell, and repeated provider lifecycle events with potentially suspicious command lines. These behaviors collectively suggest possible malicious activity. The use of Powershell for multiple actions, including script execution and process manipulation, is a common tactic in attacks. The deletion of temporary files might be an attempt to clean up evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing system resources, creating and deleting files, and interacting with registry values.

PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting tasks but can also be abused in attacks. The fact that it's appearing so frequently raises my eyebrows. Let me look closer at the specific actions logged.\n\nLooking at the first event: `powershell.exe` was executed with an empty command line, which might not be typical. Then there are several events where PowerShell accesses processes and sets registry values. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to maintain access after reboots.\n\nAnother point is that I see a `whoami.exe` process being created. While this could just be an info-gathering tool, it's often used in attacks to check user privileges, which might indicate reconnaissance activity.\n\nThere are also instances where files are being deleted and created. For example, the command `\"cmd.exe \/c del \/f \/q \/s %TEMP%\\unidade_auxiliar.exe >nul 2>&1\"` deletes a file in the TEMP directory. Deleting temporary files can be part of an attacker's cleanup process to remove traces of their activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple events where `powershell.exe` is used with command lines that reference removing specific log files in `$env:TEMP\\key.log`. This repeated attempt to delete logs suggests an effort to cover tracks, which is a red flag for malicious behavior.\n\nThe combination of these activities—using PowerShell and cmd.exe for file deletions, registry modifications, process access, and potential persistence—creates a pattern that isn't typical of normal user activity. These actions are more aligned with those of an attacker trying to establish persistence, gather information, or cover their tracks.\n\nWhile some events on their own might not be suspicious, the aggregate behavior across all these logs indicates a possible malicious campaign.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of log events to analyze. All of them seem to be related to process creations and file operations, mostly involving PowerShell and other executables like whoami.exe and winlogbeat.exe. Let me go through each event one by one to see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nThe first few entries are about 'powershell.exe' loading images and creating files. One creates a temporary .ps1 script, which is then deleted. That seems normal because PowerShell scripts sometimes test policies or configurations. The file paths look standard, like under the user's AppData directory.\n\nThen there are multiple events where powershell.exe is called with an ampersand, which in PowerShell typically runs another command or script. But seeing this repeated so many times might be a red flag. It could indicate scripting activity or possibly automated tasks. However, without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nThere are several entries where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which suggests that PowerShell is initializing or shutting down, which is normal operation. So those don't seem concerning on their own.\n\nI also notice that whoami.exe is being executed multiple times. Whoami is a standard system tool used to display user information. Its repeated use could be part of legitimate scripts checking permissions or for other benign purposes. But if it's being called in an unusual context, like with elevated privileges, it might warrant closer look.\n\nOne event mentions 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is likely part of the Elastic Stack for log management, so that's expected behavior and not concerning.\n\nLooking at the Registry value sets, these are common during software installations or configurations. No immediate red flags there.\n\nPutting it all together, while each individual event doesn't indicate malicious activity, the sheer volume of PowerShell activities—especially repeated process creations, script file creation\/deletion, and multiple calls to whoami.exe—is notable. This could be a sign of scripting or automated processes which might be legitimate but could also be part of lateral movement in an attack.\n\nI should consider whether these actions align with normal user behavior on the system. If this level of activity is unusual, it might indicate investigation-worthy events.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes and script activities, including file creation and deletion of temporary scripts, along with repeated process creations of whoami.exe and winlogbeat.exe, suggest potential scripting or automated behavior that may warrant further investigation.\"\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are a lot of events involving PowerShell.exe and whoami.exe. Specifically, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is being accessed and whoami is being created as a process. That repetition stands out to me because usually, if something is happening multiple times in quick succession, it might indicate some kind of automated activity or script execution.\n\nLooking closer, each time PowerShell is accessed, the event type is \"ProcessAccess\" which generally means that another process is interacting with it. This could be a red flag if it's not expected behavior because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for lateral movement and executing commands. The fact that it's happening so frequently makes me wonder if this is part of a larger campaign or some kind of data collection activity.\n\nThere are also instances where whoami.exe is being run, which is typically used to determine the current user's identity. That by itself isn't necessarily suspicious, but when combined with the repeated use of PowerShell, it could be part of an attack chain. For example, attackers might use whoami to gather information about the system and then use PowerShell for more malicious tasks.\n\nAnother point I'm considering is the presence of \"Registry value set\" in one of the events. Modifying registry values can be a way to persistence or change system configurations, which is often seen in malware activities. This adds another layer to why these events might be concerning.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. While this could just be normal logging activity, it's worth checking if this process was initiated by something else, like the PowerShell scripts, which might be trying to log their actions or create backdoors.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of repeated PowerShell access, execution of whoami, and registry modifications suggests possible malicious behavior. This batch shows a pattern that could indicate an attack, such as credential harvesting, lateral movement, or setting up persistence mechanisms. Therefore, these events are likely worth investigating further to determine if they're part of a larger security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell.exe accesses and whoami.exe executions, which could indicate malicious activity such as credential gathering or lateral movement.
