I'm going to go through each one and see if there's anything that stands out as potentially malicious or suspicious.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for executing commands, so this could be red flag. But sometimes legitimate use too, so I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nSecond event: whoami.exe ran. That seems normal; users might check their permissions or system info with that. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThird event: cmd.exe was executed with a command to create a service called win32times. The command line has \"cmd \/c start c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Wait, the path ends with .ps1, which is PowerShell script. Creating a service that runs a script might be setting up persistence. This looks concerning.\n\nFourth event: Another powershell.exe access. Maybe related to the previous one if it's part of a chain.\n\nFifth event: sc.exe used to create another service called win32times with a different script path. Again, NonExistingScript.ps1 is in the command line. Two services being created with similar names and script execution makes me think this could be an attempt to install malicious scripts as startup items for persistence.\n\nSixth to eighth events: services.exe modifying registry values multiple times. Services.exe usually manages system services, but frequent changes might indicate tampering or installation of new services.\n\nNinth event: sc.exe querying a service (sc qc win32times). Could be checking if the service exists or is running correctly, but in context with previous events, maybe ensuring persistence.\n\nTenth to twelfth events: cmd.exe and others like notepad.exe accessing registry. Registry modifications are common but when combined with creating services, could indicate malicious activity. Notepad might seem innocent, but if it's part of script execution, it might be writing or reading sensitive areas.\n\nThirteenth event: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems odd because Calculator typically doesn't interact with URL-related DLLs like urlmon. Could be a sign of malicious code injection or loadlibrary attacks.\n\nFourteenth to fifteenth events: svchost.exe modifying registry. Svchost is a common system process, but if it's making unexpected changes, especially in tandem with other suspicious activities, could be part of a rootkit or service manipulation.\n\nSixteenth event: Calculator.exe loading amsi.dll. ASI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) DLLs are used by antivirus software. If an application is directly loading this, might indicate attempts to bypass AMSI checks, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nSeventeenth to twenty-second events: Chrome accessing registry and image load for amsi.dll. While Chrome could have legitimate reasons to interact with the registry, multiple entries might suggest something amiss, but it's less concerning than other activities.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- Multiple instances of service creation with PowerShell scripts.\n- Registry modifications by various processes that are unusual or potentially malicious.\n- Unusual DLL loads (urlmon and amsi) in non-related applications like Calculator.exe and Chrome.\n- Repetitive and coordinated actions across different processes (cmd, powershell, sc.exe) suggest automation or script execution.\n\nThese activities could be part of an attack chain: creating services for persistence, modifying registry to hide changes, loading DLLs to evade detection. The combination is significant enough that it merits investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious activity including service creation with non-existing scripts, registry modifications, and unusual DLL loads in processes like Calculator.exe and Chrome, indicating potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
