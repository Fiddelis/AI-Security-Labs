I'm new to analyzing these logs, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see a lot of PowerShell activity. There are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed and files are being loaded. Specifically, there's a command line that stands out: it's using findstr to search for \"pass\" in various file types like .xml, .doc, .txt, etc., which might be looking for sensitive information.\n\nAlso, I notice that PowerShell created and then deleted a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1. Creating and deleting files quickly can sometimes be a sign of malicious activity because attackers might not want to leave evidence behind.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of the same command line in several events, which suggests automated or script-based behavior. This repetition could indicate that something is running multiple times, possibly trying different things or attempting to stay under the radar.\n\nThere's also an entry where whoami.exe was run. That tool can be used to determine user privileges and might be part of a reconnaissance effort to see what permissions the attacker has.\n\nLooking at other processes like notepad.exe, calc.exe, findstr.exe, and svchost.exe, they don't seem suspicious on their own, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it raises questions. For example, using notepad to edit files or svchost.exe for legitimate tasks is normal, but when paired with the other signs, it could be part of a larger malicious routine.\n\nThe events related to file creation and deletion, along with registry changes (like Registry value set), might indicate that something is trying to modify system configurations or create persistence points. This could allow an attacker to maintain access to the system even after a restart.\n\nPutting all these together—multiple PowerShell instances, scripts searching for sensitive data, quick file deletions, whoami.exe, and registry modifications—it seems like there's a pattern of potentially malicious activities. Each individual event might not be alarming, but collectively, they point towards something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands that search for sensitive information and evidence of script execution and deletion, which may indicate malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first line is Calculator.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because Calculator might need some settings stored in the registry. Then there are two powershell.exe processes setting registry values and accessing other processes. Powershell is often used for scripting, but it can be malicious if used in certain ways. Next, chrome.exe creates a pipe and sets multiple registry values, makes DNS queries, loads an image, and establishes network connections. Chrome doing these things could be normal depending on what the user is doing online.\n\nThere's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which is likely part of log management, so that seems benign. Then several more chrome events including image loading for amsi.dll, which is related to antivirus or anti-malware scanning, so that's normal.\n\nI notice schtasks.exe being used with commands like '\/delete' and specific task names. Deleting tasks could be legitimate admin work, but it might also indicate an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms by malware. The command lines have task names with \"_base_005_OnLogon\" and similar patterns, which seem arbitrary. That's a bit suspicious.\n\nSVCHOST.exe is involved in registry events; since svchost runs many services, this could be normal system activity or part of malicious processes trying to hide.\n\nThere are multiple cmd.exe and conhost.exe events setting registry values. Conhost is often used by attackers to execute commands without being detected easily, so that's a red flag. Powershell again accessing processes—this repetition might indicate something malicious, like process injection or lateral movement.\n\nWMIC.exe loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender could be part of legitimate operations, but sometimes attackers abuse WMIC for remote execution.\n\nNotepad.exe setting registry values is unusual because notepad isn't typically used for that. It's more likely a user editing text files, so this might be suspicious if there's no clear reason for it to modify the registry.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell and cmd with specific commands, schtasks deleting tasks, conhost.exe activity, and unusual notepad behavior suggest possible malicious activities. These could indicate an attacker trying to maintain persistence, delete traces, or perform actions that are part of a broader attack campaign.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and deleting scheduled tasks, along with conhost.exe and notepad.exe setting registry values, indicate potential malicious activities such as persistence removal or unauthorized system changes.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few events show processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe being created or accessed. Not too unusual on their own since these are common system tools. But then I notice some command lines, like \"whoami.exe\" being run, which might be used to check user permissions.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of PowerShell being accessed but without specific commands. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities. The fact that it's accessed so many times might indicate something suspicious, especially if there are no clear benign reasons for these accesses.\n\nLooking further down, I see cmd.exe deleting user accounts like \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\" and \"pacote_auxiliar_Admin\". Deleting accounts can be part of system maintenance, but without context, it could also be an attempt to remove traces or access rights. The use of \"\/del \/domain\" suggests a domain-wide deletion, which is more significant than local.\n\nThere are events where services like \"win32times\" are being deleted using sc.exe. Deleting services can disrupt normal operations, and if done without authorization, it could be malicious.\n\nAnother event shows cmd.exe deleting files in the Temp directory. The paths mentioned seem specific, and the use of redirection to suppress output (\">nul 2>&1\") is a common tactic in scripts to avoid detection. This might indicate an attempt to remove evidence or cleanup after some activity.\n\nI also notice several events where powershell.exe is being executed with \"& {}\" as the command line. This seems odd because it's not a typical way to run PowerShell. It could be an attempt to bypass certain logging mechanisms or execute malicious scripts without leaving clear traces.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple RegistryEvent tasks. registry modifications can be part of installing software or making system changes, but in combination with other activities, they might indicate tampering with system settings to maintain persistence or hide malicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated access and usage of PowerShell without obvious commands, deletion of user accounts and services, file deletions in the Temp directory using cmd.exe, and unusual PowerShell command lines. These actions could be indicative of a potential security incident, such as unauthorized account deletions, service disruption, or an attempt to cover tracks by deleting log files or malicious tools.\n\nI should consider if these activities are within normal user behavior for the system. If this level of activity isn't typical, especially the repeated and varied use of command-line tools and Registry changes, it might signal a breach or suspicious activity that warrants closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple instances of potentially malicious activities such as unauthorized user deletions, service removals, file deletions in the Temp directory, and unusual PowerShell executions.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst off, there are several entries where powershell.exe is involved. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used in malicious activities, like executing scripts or commands. The first few events show powershell.exe loading mscoree.dll and clr.dll. Those DLLs are part of the .NET framework, which is legitimate, but sometimes attackers use them for obfuscation or to execute malicious code.\n\nThen there's a file creation event by powershell.exe in the Temporary folder: __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. Temporary files created by scripts can be suspicious because they might be part of a script execution process, which could indicate malicious activity if it's not expected. But sometimes legitimate scripts also create temp files.\n\nNext, I see some events where powershell.exe is accessing processes and registry values. Process access alone isn't necessarily bad; it could be for legitimate scripting or administrative tasks. However, repeated accesses to multiple processes might warrant closer look, especially if they're accessing a lot of different processes without a clear reason.\n\nThere's also an event involving whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is a standard Windows utility that displays user information, so by itself it's not suspicious. But in the context of other powershell activities, it could be part of an attack chain to gather information about the system or user.\n\nLooking further, there are entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is likely monitoring logs and writing configurations, which is normal behavior, so those events probably aren't concerning on their own.\n\nThen I notice RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe making registry changes. Those processes seem benign—RuntimeBroker handles user runtime permissions, and Notepad is a simple text editor. Registry modifications are common and usually not malicious unless they're extensive or unusual in nature.\n\nThere's also calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is part of Windows' URL handling. This seems normal for an application needing to handle web-related functions, so no red flags here.\n\nFinally, chrome.exe has multiple DNS queries and network connections. Browsers naturally perform these actions when browsing the internet, so they're expected and not indicative of malicious behavior unless there's something unusual about the domains being accessed or a high volume of activity.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch includes several powershell events which could be suspicious due to their potential for abuse, but many of them are benign activities like loading DLLs and accessing processes. The creation of temporary script files might raise an eyebrow, but without more context on what the script does, it's hard to say. There's no clear evidence of malicious behavior beyond powershell usage, which is sometimes legitimate.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because while powershell and some file creations are present, there's a lack of overt signs like failed access attempts, known malicious URLs, or unusual process trees that would clearly indicate an attack. However, the presence of whoami.exe and temp script files could be minor red flags, but not enough to warrant immediate investigation without further data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains several events involving powershell.exe and other processes, but there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The events include normal process creation, file operations, and registry access, which are not inherently suspicious.\"\n}\n```"}
