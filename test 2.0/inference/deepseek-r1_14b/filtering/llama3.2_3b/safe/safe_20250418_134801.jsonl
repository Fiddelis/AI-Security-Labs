For example, there's a lot of file creation and deletion by Microsoft Edge Update and Windows services like svchost.exe. These activities are typical during software updates or maintenance.\n\nThere's also activity from winlogbeat.exe, which is likely a log management tool creating configuration files. Powershell.exe running in non-interactive mode might be part of scheduled tasks, which isn't unusual.\n\nSome events show registry value changes and image loading by various services, which again falls within regular system behavior. The Dns query from chrome.exe is standard for web browsing.\n\nThe only potentially notable event is the deletion of a MicrosoftEdge_X64 file in the user's Temp directory. However, since this is logged as a delete operation, it could be part of normal cleanup processes during an update or installation.\n\nOverall, there doesn't seem to be any signs of malicious activity or unusual deviations from expected behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events. Each event is a JSON object that seems to be related to file creation activities on a Windows system. The common elements in each event are the process name \"git.exe\", the task being \"File created\" under the winlog category, and the file path pointing to various locations within the node_modules directory for semver.\n\nFirst off, I recognize that git.exe is often used for version control with Git repositories. So if someone is working on a project that uses Node.js, they might have a package.json file where they specify dependencies, including semver for handling semantic versioning. When running npm install or yarn add, it's common to see the node_modules folder getting populated as packages and their modules are downloaded and extracted.\n\nLooking at all these events together, they're all creating files under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\semver. The file paths vary between different subdirectories like functions, classes, ranges, etc., which makes sense for a module structure. Each event corresponds to the creation of specific JavaScript files that are part of the semver package.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no indication of unusual processes or access times. The filenames and paths seem standard for a Node.js module setup. Since all events are from the same process, git.exe, it likely means this is related to cloning or updating a repository where node_modules are being set up.\n\nThere's also consistency in the timestamps—if these were spread out over time with irregular intervals, that might raise an eyebrow, but since they're part of a batch during an install or update, it's normal. The file paths don't point to any sensitive areas outside the project directory either.\n\nSo putting it all together, this looks like legitimate activity from a developer environment setting up dependencies. No red flags for malicious behavior here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation activities during the setup of node_modules for a project, likely part of a Git repository being cloned or updated. There are no signs of malicious activity.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of JSONL events to analyze. Each line represents an event with some details about a file being created by the git.exe process. Let me start by understanding what each part of these logs means.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that every entry has \"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"}, which tells me that Git is creating or modifying files. The \"winlog\" field indicates that it's a file creation event with a specific rule. The \"file\" section shows the path where the file was created.\n\nNow, looking at the file paths, they all seem to be under the directory \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\". This looks like a user's download folder containing files related to a course or project, possibly for a software quality class. The subdirectories include \"node_modules\", which is typical in Node.js projects where packages and modules are stored.\n\nEach event corresponds to the creation of files within these node_modules directories. For example, semver, serialize-javascript, set-blocking, set-function-length, shebang-command, and shebang-regex are all npm package names. The files created include various types like .js, .LICENSE, .json, .md (Markdown), and configuration files like .eslintrc or .nycrc.\n\nSince all these events are generated by git.exe, it's likely that the user is cloning a repository, extracting files, or performing some Git operations that result in file creation. The fact that multiple files from different packages are being created suggests that this might be part of installing dependencies during a npm install command or similar process.\n\nI should consider whether these activities are normal or if they indicate something malicious. Typically, when you're working on a Node.js project, cloning repositories and installing dependencies is standard behavior. The presence of .gitignore files and various package.json files further supports this as part of the development workflow.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that these events aren't indicative of something else, like a script being executed that creates multiple files quickly or in an unusual pattern. But given that each event is just a file creation without any anomalies like access rights changes, network connections, or other signs of malicious activity, it seems benign.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the frequency and volume of these events. If this is part of a routine project setup, having 18 such events in a batch could be normal. But if this happened suddenly without context, it might warrant closer look. However, since the paths are predictable and consistent with development activities, I don't see any red flags.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the file types and their locations, they all fit within standard npm package structures. There's no indication of unexpected files or executables being created outside the project directories. All created files are in the node_modules folder, which is expected during a build or install process.\n\nI should also check if there are any deviations from normal behavior, such as file creation times or paths that don't align with typical usage. Since everything here seems to be standard for npm package setup, there's no cause for concern.\n\nIn conclusion, these events appear to be related to setting up a Node.js project or cloning a repository where multiple dependencies and their files are being created. There's nothing unusual in the actions described that would suggest malicious intent or security issues.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of JSONL events represents normal file creation activities associated with setting up a Node.js project. Each event indicates that Git is creating files within the \"node_modules\" directory, which is typical during npm package installations or when cloning repositories. These activities are expected in a development environment and do not exhibit signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe events describe normal file creation actions by Git as part of setting up a Node.js project, likely during an npm install or repository clone. There's no indication of unusual activity suggesting a security issue.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Normal development activities related to Node.js package setup.\",\n  \"events\": {\n    \"count\": 18,\n    \"description\": \"Multiple files created under 'node_modules' by Git, typical during project setup.\"\n  },\n  \"suggestions\": [\n    \"No immediate security concerns identified.\",\n    \"Check if these events align with expected development workflows.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries where each line represents an event on a Windows system. Each event has details about the process involved, a Windows log task description, and file information.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, they all have \"git.exe\" as the process name. The task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates that a new file was created. The file paths are all within a user's Downloads folder under a specific course named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". Inside this folder, there are node_modules directories with various packages like side-channel, signal-exit, and sshpk.\n\nHmm, so the events are all related to Git creating files in a Node.js project structure. It seems like someone is working on a software development project using Git and Node modules. The file paths include typical package files like package.json, index.js, README.md, and others that you'd expect in a standard npm package setup.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual process names, strange file creation locations outside the expected project structure, or any indicators of compromise like execution of scripts or modifications to system files. It's all within the context of a software development environment.\n\nSo, considering all these events together, they seem normal for someone developing software with Git and Node.js. There's nothing out of the ordinary that would raise red flags in terms of security.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of files by git.exe during development activities, which is a normal process and not indicative of malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I have a batch of log events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format, so one JSON object per line. The task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, each event has three main components: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always \"git.exe\". The winlog indicates that a file was created, with the rule being \"FileCreate\". The file paths vary but all seem to be under a directory called \"node_modules\" in a user's Downloads folder.\n\nSo, breaking it down, each event shows git.exe creating a new file. The files are located within node_modules directories of different packages like sshpk, string-width, strip-ansi, etc. These are all typical Node.js module names. \n\nI remember that when you install Node.js packages using npm, the system often creates several files in the node_modules folders—like package.json for each module, index files, readmes, licenses, and so on. It makes sense that git.exe is creating these files if the user is working with a Git repository that includes these modules.\n\nAlso, considering that all events are from the same process (git.exe) performing similar actions (file creation), it doesn't seem unusual. If there were multiple different processes or actions, that might raise an eyebrow, but here everything looks consistent with normal package installations or updates in a Node.js environment.\n\nI should also think about whether git.exe is typically involved in such file operations. From what I know, when you clone a repository or update dependencies using npm, Git can track changes and create files as part of the process. So it's plausible that these events are just part of normal development workflow.\n\nAdditionally, there's nothing indicating any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file names, no execution logs, no access to restricted areas—just standard file creations within expected directories for a Node.js project. \n\nSo putting it all together, the batch shows git.exe creating multiple files in node_modules, which is normal during package installations or updates. There's nothing out of the ordinary that suggests malicious behavior or any security incident. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating files within a node_modules directory, which is typical during Node.js package installations and updates.
