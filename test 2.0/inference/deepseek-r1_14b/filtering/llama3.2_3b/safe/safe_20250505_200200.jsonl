{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the first event shows ssh.exe creating a file in the .ssh directory. That's normal for SSH key management, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, powershell.exe is being run without any command line arguments. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, but just starting it isn't unusual on its own.\n\nThen, I see multiple ImageLoad events from different DLL files when running PowerShell. This is standard as scripts often load various libraries, so these aren't red flags unless the specific DLLs are known to be malicious.\n\nLooking at the file operations: there's a file being created and then deleted in the Temp directory with a name like __PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1. This pattern is common when scripts check for policy enforcement or try to avoid detection, which could indicate something malicious. However, sometimes legitimate scripts also do this for testing purposes.\n\nAnother event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. That's expected if the tool is running and updating its settings, so no issues there.\n\nLastly, svchost.exe is involved in creating some XboxLive files. Svchost is a common system process that hosts various services, including legitimate ones like XboxLive, so this activity isn't suspicious.\n\nConsidering all these events together: there are multiple PowerShell instances with file operations and DLL loading, which might be part of a script checking its environment or attempting to execute commands. The creation and deletion of the temporary script file is more concerning because it's a behavior often seen in malicious scripts trying to avoid detection by quickly creating and then deleting files.\n\nPutting this all together, while individual events aren't necessarily suspicious, the combination—especially the PowerShell activity with the temporary script file—is notable enough to warrant further investigation. It could be an attempt at lateral movement or exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe creating and deleting files, which may indicate potential malicious activity such as script execution testing policies or attempting to avoid detection.\"\n}\n```"}
