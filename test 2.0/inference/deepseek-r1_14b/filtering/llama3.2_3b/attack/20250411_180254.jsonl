{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst event: Process Create for cmd.exe with the command line running systeminfo and querying some registry keys. That's a bit concerning because using cmd.exe with systeminfo is often used by attackers to gather system information, which is a common early step in an attack. The registry query part also stands out because accessing specific service-related keys might be part of privilege escalation.\n\nNext event: Process Create for systeminfo.exe. That seems suspicious too since systeminfo is a command usually used to display system configuration info and is often abused by malware.\n\nThird event: Image loaded for systeminfo.exe pointing to amsi.dll, which is related to anti-malware scanning. Sometimes attackers load modules to bypass such protections, so that's another red flag.\n\nFourth event: Another Image Load from systeminfo.exe but this time to MpOAV.dll, part of Windows Defender. Again, could be an attempt to analyze or disable security components.\n\nFifth event: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. While calc is a common tool, the URLMON module is related to handling URLs and can sometimes be used for communication with external servers, which might indicate exfiltration or command and control.\n\nThen there are events where svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, and chrome.exe set registry values. Svchost is a common process but setting registry values could be modifying service configurations, possibly enabling persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple processes creating and loading modules related to system info gathering, anti-malware bypass attempts, and potential communication via URLMON. These activities don't seem like normal user behavior and align with tactics used in cyberattacks, such as reconnaissance and preparing the environment for further malicious actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious process creations and image loads, including systeminfo.exe which is often used by malware. Additionally, there are attempts to load anti-malware modules and access registry keys, indicating potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
