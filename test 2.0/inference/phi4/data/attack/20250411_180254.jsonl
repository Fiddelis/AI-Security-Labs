These actions are often associated with reconnaissance or data exfiltration efforts by malware. Additionally, SVCHOST manipulation and Registry events, combined with process creation of WMI-related executables like WmiPrvSE.exe, suggest potential persistence mechanisms or lateral movement attempts. The combination of these indicators across different tools (e.g., PowerShell, cmd.exe) warrants further investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
