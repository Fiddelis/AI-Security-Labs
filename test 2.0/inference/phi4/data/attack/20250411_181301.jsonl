The ImageLoad events involving 'tasklist.exe', 'chrome.exe', and 'svchost.exe' loading critical system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll could indicate attempts to bypass security features. Finally, the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe might suggest persistence mechanisms or malware activities.\"\n}\n```"}
