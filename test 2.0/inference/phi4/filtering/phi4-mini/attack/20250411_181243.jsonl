PowerShell is used to list users, groups, and logon sessions (cmdkey.exe \/list), as well as access the local file system (ls, get-childitem). Additionally, net.exe and a suspicious variant (net1.exe) are employed for querying group memberships, which could be indicative of privilege escalation attempts. Registry modifications by conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and svchost.exe may suggest attempts to persist or alter the system configuration maliciously. The presence of such activities warrants further investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
