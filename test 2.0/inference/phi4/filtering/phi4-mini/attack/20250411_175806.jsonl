Additionally, there are several registry modification events (RegistryEvent) targeting the HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run key, often used to achieve persistence. The creation of files with specific command lines and processes such as 'cmd.exe' and 'reg.exe' being used for modifying registry entries is suspicious. This combination suggests potential malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistence or executing unauthorized commands.\"\n}\n```"}
