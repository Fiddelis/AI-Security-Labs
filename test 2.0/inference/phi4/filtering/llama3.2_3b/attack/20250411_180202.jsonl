Specifically, 'powershell.exe' is involved in accessing a process and creating a file, while 'WMIC.exe' loads system-critical DLLs (amsi.dll and MpClient.dll), potentially to disable security mechanisms. These patterns suggest possible post-exploitation activity or privilege escalation attempts.\"\n}\n```"}
