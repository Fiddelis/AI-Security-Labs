The repeated loading of system DLLs, particularly by non-system executables like EXCEL.EXE, could indicate malicious behavior such as code injection or process hollowing. Additionally, 'Registry value set' events related to critical services ('svchost.exe', 'RuntimeBroker.exe') can be indicative of configuration changes for persistence or privilege escalation attempts.\"\n}\n```"}
