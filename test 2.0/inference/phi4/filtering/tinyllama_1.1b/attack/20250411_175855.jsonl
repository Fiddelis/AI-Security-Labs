Additionally, there are several instances of registry value modifications by processes like `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `RuntimeBroker.exe`. The execution of `whoami.exe` is unusual unless specifically intended to gather system information, suggesting potential privilege escalation activities. Combined with other anomalies such as multiple registry changes and process accesses, these events warrant further investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
