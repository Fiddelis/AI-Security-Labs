Additionally, there are several instances of 'Registry value set' events involving both legitimate applications like chrome.exe and potentially malicious ones like powershell.exe, suggesting potential tampering or persistence mechanisms. The usage of svchost.exe for file creation in system logs and winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files outside expected directories also warrants further investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
