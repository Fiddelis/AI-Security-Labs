These include setting registry values, file creation in unusual directories, modifying timestamps of files (setting them to an early Unix epoch time which is often used in scripts for obfuscation), and loading specific DLLs related to Windows Defender that could be leveraged by attackers. The repetitive nature of these PowerShell activities, combined with the use of potentially suspicious commands like changing file attributes, suggests a need for further investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
