{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This log data reveals a series of actions taken by PowerShell, indicating a likely malicious or suspicious activity. Here's a breakdown and explanation of what's happening, broken down into categories and with possible implications:\n\n**1. Initial Setup & PowerShell Execution**\n\n*   **`Process Create: powershell.exe`:**  The execution starts with the launching of PowerShell.\n*   **`Process accessed: powershell.exe`:** The process is being accessed.\n*   **Image Load Events:**  These show the DLLs being loaded by PowerShell during execution.  Crucially, `mscoree.dll` and the .NET framework components (`clr.dll`) are loaded, indicating the script leverages .NET capabilities.  This is common for many legitimate scripts, but also used by malware.  The presence of  `MpOAV.dll` (Microsoft Platform and Operational Agent Viewer) is unusual and warrants investigation as it is associated with Windows Defender and might be involved in evasion or malicious activities.\n\n**2. Script Execution & File Operations**\n\n*   **`File created: C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`:**  A PowerShell script (`.ps1`) is created in the user's temporary directory.  The filename `__PSScriptPolicyTest_` suggests an attempt to bypass PowerShell's execution policy. This is a common tactic to avoid detection.  The long random-looking sequence (rxszx2r5) likely indicates it was generated dynamically to further obscure its purpose.\n*   **`File Delete logged: C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`:** Immediately after creation, the script is deleted.  This is a major red flag. Deleting the script after running it suggests an attempt to hide evidence of malicious actions.\n\n**3. Registry Interactions**\n\n*   **`Registry value set: svchost.exe`**: Registry is being modified - usually to establish persistence or modify system behaviour. This is a potential persistence mechanism.\n\n**4. Unusual Defender Element**\n\n*   **Presence of `MpOAV.dll`:**  The loading of this DLL from Windows Defenderâ€™s platform directory is unusual for typical PowerShell scripts. While it's a legitimate component, its involvement points towards attempts to interact with or manipulate Windows Defender processes. The script might be trying to disable, evade, or otherwise interfere with Defender's functionality.\n\n**Interpretation & Potential Threats**\n\n*   **Bypassing Execution Policy:** The temporary creation and immediate deletion of the `.ps1` file combined with the filename strongly indicates an attempt to bypass PowerShell's execution policy.  This is a common technique used by attackers to run scripts that would otherwise be blocked.\n*   **Malicious Code Execution:**  The contents of the deleted script are unknown, but its creation and deletion pattern is a strong indicator of malicious code execution.  It is highly likely that the script performed actions that the attacker wanted to conceal.\n*   **Evading Detection:** The combination of bypassing execution policy, deleting the script, and the unusual Defender DLL interaction suggests the attacker is actively trying to evade detection by security tools, including potentially Windows Defender itself.\n*   **Persistence:** The registry modification points to an attempt to create a persistent backdoor.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Scan:**  Run a full scan with a reputable EDR solution to detect any remaining malicious components or processes.\n2.  **Memory Dump Analysis:**  Consider taking a memory dump of the `powershell.exe` process and having it analyzed by a security expert.  This may reveal the contents of the deleted script.\n3.  **Process Timeline Analysis:**  Review the entire process timeline for `powershell.exe` to identify any other suspicious activity.\n4.  **Review Registry Changes:** Carefully examine the registry changes made by the `svchost.exe` process to understand their impact on the system.\n5.  **Investigate Defender Interactions:** If the `MpOAV.dll` interaction is confirmed, investigate if Windows Defender is functioning correctly and hasn't been tampered with.\n6.  **User Behavior Monitoring:**  Monitor the user account ('fiddelis') for any other unusual activity.\n7.  **PowerShell Logging and Auditing:**  Improve PowerShell logging and auditing to capture more details about script execution and command-line arguments.\n8.  **PowerShell Security Posture:**  Review and strengthen PowerShell security policies, including execution policy, script signing requirements, and constrained language mode.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  This analysis is based solely on the provided log data. A full investigation may be required to confirm the presence of malicious activity and determine its full scope."}
