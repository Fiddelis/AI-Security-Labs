{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"It seems like you're analyzing Windows event logs from Elasticsearch, possibly using Winlogbeat. Here's a breakdown of the events you've shared:\n\n1. **Process-related events:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` was created and started.\n   - `sppsvc.exe` (Windows Push Notification Service) loaded `taskschd.dll`.\n   - `notepad.exe` loaded `urlmon.dll`.\n   - `chrome.exe` made several DNS queries, possibly for loading web resources.\n   - `Calculator.exe`, `setup.exe`, and `winlogbeat.exe` were created and started.\n\n2. **Registry-related events:**\n   - Several registry values were set under different keys by various processes:\n     - `svchost.exe` (Service Host process) made multiple changes to HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\*.\n     - `notepad.exe` changed a value under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\.\n     - `chrome.exe` modified values under HKCU\\Software\\Policies\\Google\\Chrome\\ and HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Google\\Chrome\\.\n\n3. **File-related events:**\n   - `.winlogbeat.yml.new` was created in the winlogbeat data directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\\").\n   - `b8d633a2-08f3-4e51-85c3-3602fa580c63.tmp` was created in the Windows System Temp directory (`C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp\\\").\n\nThese events suggest normal system activity, like web browsing (chrome.exe), software installation (setup.exe), and configuration changes made by running applications. However, you might want to investigate further if there are any unusual or unwanted modifications, especially registry changes made by unfamiliar processes or unauthorized users.\n\nTo better understand the context of these events, consider looking into:\n- The timestamps of each event.\n- The user accounts associated with the processes.\n- The content of the `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file, as it might indicate configuration changes related to Winlogbeat.\n- Whether the `b8d633a2-08f3-4e51-85c3-3602fa580c63.tmp` file was created by a legitimate process and whether it's being used appropriately."}
