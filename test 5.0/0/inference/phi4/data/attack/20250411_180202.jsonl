The presence of commands executed via PowerShell, such as file creation and registry modifications, alongside the use of tools like `whoami.exe` and `WMIC.exe` for system information gathering or manipulation, raises suspicion. Additionally, the actions performed by `RuntimeBroker.exe`, typically associated with Windows Store apps, accessing sensitive operations like setting a registry value is unusual and potentially malicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
