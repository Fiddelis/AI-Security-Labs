The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each line.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries with \"powershell.exe\" and various winlog tasks. The first event is a Process accessed, then a Process Create for whoami.exe. Then more Process accessed for powershell. Then a Registry value set by powershell. Then a Process Create with a command line that stands out. The command line shows creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to a suspicious location: \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\". That path doesn't look standard; it's in a directory named \"unidade_logico\" which might be a typo or a non-standard directory. Also, the service is started immediately after creation. That's a red flag because creating and starting a service from a non-standard path could be part of an attack.\n\nNext, several Image loaded events for powershell.exe, loading various DLLs. Some are legitimate, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of .NET. However, the presence of multiple image loads might be normal, but combined with other events, it could indicate something. Then a File created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That could be part of a script execution, but the deletion might be to cover tracks.\n\nThen a Pipe Created event, which is normal for inter-process communication, but again, in context with other events. The services.exe entries have Registry value sets, but multiple times. Services.exe is a legitimate system process, but if it's modifying registry values, that's not typical. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But combined with the previous PowerShell activities, maybe there's a connection.\n\nPutting this all together: the PowerShell process is creating a new service with a non-standard executable path, which is suspicious. The command line uses New-Service and Start-Service, which are PowerShell cmdlets. The fact that the service is created and started immediately could be an attempt to run a malicious payload. Also, the presence of multiple image loads and file operations might be part of an attack chain. The registry modifications by services.exe might be unrelated, but the overall pattern of PowerShell doing unusual things (creating services, loading DLLs, creating and deleting files) suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nSo, the classification here is likely \"INTERESTING\" because there's a clear attempt to create and start a service from a non-standard path, which is a common indicator of compromise. The confidence is high, maybe around 0.85, because the evidence points to suspicious behavior that's not typical for normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes perform suspicious actions including creating a new service with a non-standard binary path (C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\...\\\\tarefa_logico.exe) and loading potentially malicious DLLs.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there's 'services.exe' doing registry value sets. That's normal because services.exe is part of the Windows operating system and handles service control. But then there's 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading several DLLs from the .NET Framework. Wait, 'tarefa_logico.exe' isn't a standard Windows process. The name seems a bit off. The files it's loading are all legitimate .NET DLLs, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. But loading multiple .NET DLLs might be normal if it's a .NET application. However, the fact that it's repeatedly loading these files could be a red flag if it's not supposed to be doing that.\n\nThen there's 'powershell.exe' creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's not necessarily bad, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell for malicious activities. However, the file created is 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive', which sounds like a legitimate PowerShell profile file. But I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity related to PowerShell here. Another entry shows PowerShell setting a registry value, which might be part of configuration changes, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' setting registry values. These are common system processes, so their activity might be normal. However, the repetition of 'Registry value set' events could indicate some automated process or potential tampering, but again, without knowing the specific changes, it's hard to say.\n\nThe most suspicious part is the 'tarefa_logico.exe' process. The name doesn't ring a bell as a standard Windows process. It's loading several .NET DLLs, which could be part of a legitimate application, but the repeated loading might be unusual. Also, the fact that there's a 'tarefa_logico.exe' process running and loading those DLLs might indicate a potential malicious payload, especially if it's not a known application. However, I should check if 'tarefa_logico.exe' is a legitimate process. Maybe it's a typo or a misnamed process. Alternatively, it could be a foreign process, like a Brazilian term for \"logical task,\" but that's speculative.\n\nAnother point is the number of events. There are multiple 'Registry value set' events from 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe', but that's common in system logs. However, the presence of 'tarefa_logico.exe' with multiple image loads might be more concerning. If this process is not known to the system or isn't part of any installed software, that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, the file created by PowerShell is in a common location, but sometimes attackers use such paths to hide malicious files. However, the filename doesn't seem to be anything obviously malicious. Without more context, like the content of the file or other related events, it's hard to be certain.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of an unknown process ('tarefa_logico.exe') loading multiple .NET DLLs could be a sign of something suspicious. While the other events are normal system activities, the unusual process name and the repeated image loads might warrant further investigation.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to the Registry being modified. Processes like svchost.exe and services.exe are making changes to the registry, which is normal to some extent, but when it's frequent, it might be a red flag. However, setup.exe is also involved here. Now, setup.exe is typically associated with installation processes. But wait, looking further down, there are file creation events under setup.exe. The files created are things like msedge_proxy.exe, pwahelper.exe, and some shortcuts for Microsoft Edge. \n\nHmm, Microsoft Edge is a legitimate application, but the presence of these files in specific directories might be part of a legitimate installation. However, the fact that setup.exe is creating these files could be part of a malicious installation if it's not part of a known legitimate setup. Also, the registry modifications might be part of configuring the new software. But I need to check if there's any suspicious activity here.\n\nWait, the logs don't mention any unusual processes or unexpected parent processes. All the events are from known system processes like svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe. The file paths mentioned are standard for Microsoft Edge installations. However, the high number of registry events might indicate some automated configuration, which could be part of a legitimate setup or potentially malicious. But without more context, like the origin of setup.exe or any other anomalies, it's hard to tell. \n\nBut since the user is asking if the batch is interesting, I need to consider if there's enough evidence here. The creation of specific files by setup.exe might be part of a legitimate installation, but the combination with multiple registry changes could be a sign of something more. However, without additional indicators like unexpected network activity, unusual process behavior, or known malicious hashes, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nIn this case, the presence of file creation events for Edge components might be normal if the system is installing or updating Edge. But if this is happening in an environment where such installations aren't expected, it could be suspicious. Since the logs don't provide more context, I might lean towards \"interesting\" because the combination of registry changes and file creation by setup.exe could indicate a potential installation or configuration that might need further investigation. However, the confidence isn't extremely high because it could be legitimate. So maybe a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and services.exe combined with file creation events by setup.exe, including Edge-related executables and shortcuts, suggest potential software installation or configuration activity that may require further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the whole batch and decide if it's worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are a lot of entries where the process is 'svchost.exe' and the winlog task is 'Registry value set'. svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, if there are multiple registry changes, that might be suspicious. But since all these events are from svchost.exe and the task is just setting registry values, maybe they're normal system activities. But then again, malware can also use svchost.exe to hide its activities. However, the fact that all these entries are the same might indicate something automated or routine.\n\nThen there are some events related to 'setup.exe' creating files in the Program Files directory under Microsoft EdgeCore. The files created include msedge.exe, msedgewebview2.exe, and others. These seem like legitimate Microsoft Edge components. But wait, the setup.exe is creating these files, which might be part of a normal installation. However, the presence of multiple file creations could be part of a setup process. But why are there so many entries? Also, there's a 'show_third_party_software_licenses.bat' file created, which might be part of the installation, but could also be a red flag if it's unexpected.\n\nAnother event shows 'setup.exe' loading 'taskschd.dll' from the System32 directory. That's a legitimate DLL used by Task Scheduler. But if it's being loaded by setup.exe, maybe that's part of a scheduled task creation, which could be normal during installation.\n\nBut here's a thought: if this is part of a legitimate Edge installation, then these events are normal. However, the user might be looking for something malicious. The key is whether these events are out of the ordinary. If this is a new installation or update, then it's expected. But if the system hasn't had any recent installations, then this could be suspicious.\n\nBut looking at the data, there's no context about the system's state. The batch includes both registry changes by svchost.exe and file creations by setup.exe. The svchost.exe events are all the same, which might be a normal service update, but the repetition could be a sign of something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The setup.exe events seem to be part of installing or updating Microsoft Edge, which is a legitimate activity.\n\nBut wait, the presence of multiple registry changes by svchost.exe might be normal, but if they're all in the same time frame, maybe that's a sign of a system change. However, the justification for classification should be based on the events provided. Since the setup.exe is creating files that are part of a known software (Microsoft Edge), and svchost.exe is a normal process, maybe this isn't suspicious. But then again, if these events are not part of a known installation, they could be malicious.\n\nBut without more information, like the user's system state or other indicators, it's tricky. However, the presence of multiple file creations under a legitimate software directory might be normal. The confidence level would depend on how common these events are. Since the user is asking to classify based on the batch, and the events seem to align with a software installation (Edge), maybe it's not interesting. But the repetition of svchost.exe's registry changes could still be a point of concern. However, if the setup.exe is part of a legitimate installation, then the events are normal. So maybe the classification is 'NOT INTERESTING' because it's part of a normal installation. But I need to check if there's any red flags. The 'show_third_party_software_licenses.bat' might be a red flag if it's not part of the installation, but again, without context, it's hard to say. The confidence would be medium, but since the files are in known locations, maybe it's not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events appear to be related to a legitimate Microsoft Edge installation\/update process, with setup.exe creating expected Edge-related files and svchost.exe performing routine registry operations.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nMost of the entries are about 'setup.exe' performing registry operations like setting values and adding\/deleting registry objects. There are also a few 'Pipe Created' events related to 'setup.exe'. Then, there's 'RuntimeBroker.exe' doing a registry value set. But the more concerning part is the 'svchost.exe' entries. \n\nLooking at the 'svchost.exe' events, they're creating files in the Windows Temp directory with names like APPX followed by random strings. That's a common tactic used by malware to drop temporary files. Also, one of the files is created in 'C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness\\S-1-5-18', which is a sensitive system directory. AppReadiness is involved in system readiness and trust, so unauthorized file creation there could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nNow, 'svchost.exe' is a legitimate process, but it's often used by malware to host malicious code. The fact that it's creating multiple files in Temp and a system directory might indicate a compromise. However, I should check if these files are part of normal system operations. But given the pattern of multiple file creations in Temp and the unusual path in AppReadiness, this seems suspicious.\n\nCombined with the registry changes by 'setup.exe', which could be part of installation or configuration, but if 'setup.exe' is not a known legitimate installer, that's a red flag. However, the presence of multiple events from 'setup.exe' modifying the registry and creating pipes might be part of a legitimate setup process. But the svchost.exe activity in sensitive locations is more concerning.\n\nSo, the mix of registry changes and unusual file creation by svchost.exe in system directories suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence is high enough to classify this as interesting, but not 100% certain without more context.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple FileCreated events by svchost.exe in the AppReadiness directory. The paths have SIDs like S-1-5-18 and S-1-5-21... which are security identifiers. The first file is EdgeGameAssist.exe in the WindowsApps folder. Now, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but creating files in AppReadiness might be odd. However, sometimes Windows updates or system processes do create files there. But then there are multiple entries for the same file path, which could indicate repeated activity. \n\nThen there are Registry value set events by svchost.exe. Again, svchost is normal, but if it's modifying registry keys, that might be suspicious. But since there are multiple entries, maybe it's part of a legitimate process. However, the repetition might be a red flag. \n\nLooking further, there's a RuntimeBroker.exe modifying the registry. RuntimeBroker is associated with UWP apps, so maybe that's normal. But again, multiple events could be concerning. \n\nThen there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that's just writing a host message. That seems benign. But then there are ImageLoaded events for various .dll files. The paths include mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET. PowerShell loading these is normal, especially if it's running .NET scripts. However, the presence of multiple image loads might be part of normal operation. \n\nWait, but the first event mentions EdgeGameAssist.exe. Microsoft Edge's GameAssist is a legitimate component, but the path is in the WindowsApps directory. However, svchost.exe creating files there might be unusual. Typically, svchost hosts system services, not application files. Maybe that's a sign of something wrong. \n\nAlso, the repeated file creation in AppReadiness with the same SIDs. Those SIDs are for built-in accounts like SYSTEM (S-1-5-18) and user accounts. Creating files in that directory with those names might be part of some system process, but I'm not sure. \n\nAnother thing is that svchost.exe is a common host for malware to hide in. If it's creating files in unexpected locations, that's a flag. However, the AppReadiness directory is used for application readiness, so maybe it's related to some update or installation. But the repetition of the same file paths might indicate a loop or a script that's not supposed to be running. \n\nThe registry events might be part of a configuration change, but again, without knowing the specific keys being modified, it's hard to say. The fact that there are so many registry events from svchost.exe could be a sign of something. \n\nPutting this all together: the presence of multiple file creations in AppReadiness by svchost.exe, along with multiple registry modifications, might be suspicious. However, the PowerShell events seem normal. The EdgeGameAssist.exe file is legitimate, but the process creating it is svchost.exe, which is not typical. That could be a sign of a malicious process masquerading as svchost. \n\nBut I need to check if svchost.exe can legitimately create files there. Maybe during an update. However, if it's creating multiple instances of the same file, that's unusual. Also, the repetition of the same file paths in the logs suggests that the same action is being logged multiple times, which might not be normal. \n\nConsidering all this, there's enough suspicious activity here to warrant further investigation.

So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like Image loaded, File created, and Process accessed. There's also a whoami.exe process, which is normal for checking user identity, but not necessarily malicious. \n\nLooking at the files involved, several entries mention Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. These are legitimate files, but their repeated loading might be a red flag. However, since they're part of Windows Defender, maybe it's just normal operation. \n\nThen there's a PowerShell command that checks for .inf files with specific patterns. The command is looking for sections like [defaultinstall.nt...], which could be related to driver installation. If this is part of a script that's trying to install a driver or modify system settings, that might be suspicious. But the command itself is just reading files, not making changes. \n\nAnother file created in the Temp directory is a .psm1 file, which is a PowerShell module. Creating modules in Temp could be part of a script's normal operation, but it could also be a sign of something malicious trying to execute code from temporary files. \n\nThe repeated loading of .dll files from .NET Framework and Windows Defender might just be part of PowerShell's execution, but if there's an unusual number of these events, it might indicate something. However, in this batch, there's not a huge number, just several instances. \n\nThe Process accessed events don't have file paths, which might be normal, but they could also be part of a larger attack. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nPutting it all together, the presence of multiple PowerShell activities, especially the script checking for .inf files and creating temporary modules, might be worth investigating.

That's suspicious because disabling Defender could be a sign of someone trying to remove security features. The command is run via cmd.exe, which is a common tool but using it to disable Defender is a red flag.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries about Dism.exe creating and detecting executable files in the Temp directory.

However, the Temp directory is often used by malicious software to store temporary files. But wait, the files here have names like DismCore.dll.mui, which are .mui files—these are language-specific resource files, not executable files. The rule \"FileExecutableDetected\" might be triggering because the system is flagging .dll files as executable, which could be a false positive.\n\nBut why so many different DLLs? If this is part of a legitimate operation, maybe Dism.exe is unpacking multiple components. However, the user is fiddelis, which isn't a standard Windows account name.

The files are all in the Temp directory under a specific GUID folder. The names of the files are things like ProvProvider.dll, SetupPlatformProvider.dll, etc. Then there's a DismHost.exe process created with a command line that includes the same GUID.

However, the number of files here is quite high, and they're all from the same GUID folder. That could be a sign of a malicious payload being executed through Dism. Alternatively, it could be a legitimate system update or imaging process. However, the fact that the files are all DLLs being loaded as executables might be unusual. Also, the names of the DLLs (like ProvProvider, SetupPlatformProvider) might be part of a legitimate setup, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the process Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but if it's being used to execute or load malicious DLLs from the Temp directory, that's a problem. However, the logs don't show any clear signs of malicious activity beyond the unusual number of files. It's possible that this is a false positive, but the combination of multiple events in the Temp directory with executable detection and image loading might be enough to flag it as interesting for further investigation.\n\nSo, the classification would be INTERESTING because there's a pattern of multiple executable files being detected and loaded from the Temp directory, which could indicate malicious activity. But I'm not 100% sure, so the confidence might be around 0.7 or 0.8. The justification would be that multiple executable files are being loaded from the Temp directory by Dism-related processes, which could be indicative of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple Dism.exe and DismHost.exe processes are loading numerous DLLs from a temporary directory, which may indicate malicious activity or a compromised system.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. All the events are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. The tasks mentioned are file deletions and a file creation time change. The files being deleted are in the Temp directory under a specific folder with a unique GUID: 33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89. \n\nNow, Dism.exe is known to be used in Windows updates and image management. However, the fact that multiple files are being deleted from the Temp directory might be normal during an update or cleanup process. But I should check if there's any suspicious pattern here.\n\nThe files being deleted include DLLs and MUI files (which are language-specific resources). The deletion of these files by Dism.exe could be part of a legitimate operation, like uninstalling a package or cleaning up temporary files after an update. However, the presence of multiple deletions might indicate that something is being removed intentionally, possibly after an installation or a failed update.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if this batch is relevant for investigation. The key here is whether these events are abnormal. Since Dism.exe is a trusted process, and the Temp directory is a common place for temporary files, this might be normal. However, if there's a pattern where Dism.exe is deleting a large number of files, especially if it's not part of a known process, that could be suspicious. \n\nBut looking at the data, all the files are in the same Temp directory under a specific GUID folder. That might indicate that they were part of a specific operation, like an update or deployment. The fact that the same process is deleting multiple files in a short time might not be inherently malicious, but it's worth checking if there are other logs or events that correlate with this, such as unexpected network activity, unauthorized access, or other anomalies.\n\nHowever, based solely on the provided logs, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity. The events are all related to a legitimate process performing actions in a temporary directory, which is a common part of system operations. Therefore, while the volume of deletions might be noteworthy, without additional context or other suspicious events, it's not conclusive enough to classify as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate Dism.exe process operations on temporary files in the expected Windows Temp directory.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll scan through each entry.\n\nMost of the events are about the DismHost.exe process loading various DLL files from a temporary directory. The files have names like IntlProvider.dll, IBSProvider.dll, etc. Then there's a Dism.exe process deleting some of these DLLs. The last event is the termination of DismHost.exe.\n\nHmm, DismHost.exe is part of the Deployment Imaging Service and Management (DISM) tool, which is used for Windows image management. Typically, DISM is used by administrators for tasks like applying updates or configuring images. However, loading multiple DLLs from the Temp folder might be unusual. Usually, legitimate processes don't load so many DLLs from temporary directories, especially if they're named in a way that seems generic or possibly obfuscated.\n\nWait, but the fact that DismHost.exe is loading these DLLs could be part of a legitimate operation. For example, during system deployment or image customization, DISM might use various providers. However, the deletion of these files by Dism.exe after they're loaded might be a red flag. Normally, if a process loads a DLL, it might keep it around, but deleting them immediately could indicate that they were temporary, but maybe there's something fishy here.\n\nAnother point is the path: the files are in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory under a unique GUID folder. That's common for temporary files, but the fact that multiple DLLs are being loaded from the same directory might be part of a larger operation. However, if these are all legitimate providers, it's okay. But if they're not, it could be malicious.\n\nWait, the names of the DLLs: IntlProvider, IBSProvider, DmiProvider, etc. Some of these might be legitimate, but others might not be. For example, \"TransmogProvider.dll\" sounds a bit odd. Transmog is a term sometimes used in gaming for transforming items, but in a system context, that's not standard. Similarly, \"OfflineSetupProvider.dll\" and \"SetupPlatformProvider.dll\" could be part of a legitimate setup process, but again, it's a bit unusual to have so many of them loaded.\n\nAlso, the fact that Dism.exe is deleting these files after they're loaded. Maybe the process is cleaning up, but maybe the files were never meant to be there. If the files were loaded and then deleted, it could be an attempt to hide the presence of malicious code. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But the combination of multiple DLLs being loaded from a temporary directory by a legitimate-sounding process (DismHost.exe) and then being deleted might be suspicious.\n\nAnother angle: the user might be running a legitimate DISM operation, but the number of DLLs loaded is high. However, DISM does use various providers, so it's possible. But the presence of multiple entries with different providers might be part of a normal operation, but the deletion by Dism.exe could be a clue. Maybe the files were temporary, but the fact that they're being deleted by a different process (Dism.exe) might be part of the normal workflow.\n\nWait, but looking at the logs, DismHost.exe is the one loading the DLLs, and then Dism.exe is deleting some of them. That might be part of the same process. For example, DismHost.exe is running, loading the necessary DLLs, and then Dism.exe is cleaning up after. However, in a normal scenario, would Dism.exe delete the DLLs that DismHost.exe loaded? It's possible, but maybe not typical.\n\nAlternatively, this could be a case where the attacker is using the legitimate DismHost.exe process to load malicious DLLs from the Temp directory, and then deleting them to avoid detection. However, without more evidence like unexpected network activity, privilege escalation, or other suspicious behaviors, it's hard to confirm.\n\nBut considering that all the events are related to the same process (DismHost.exe) and the same directory, and the files are being loaded and then deleted, this could be a legitimate operation. However, the high number of DLLs and the names might still raise a flag. The confidence here is a bit tricky. If I see multiple DLLs being loaded from Temp by a process that's usually used for system imaging, it's possible that it's legitimate, but the combination with the deletions might be suspicious.\n\nIn cybersecurity, the key is to look for anomalies. If this is part of a normal DISM operation, then it's not interesting. But if the number of DLLs is higher than usual or the names are not standard, it might be. Since the names are somewhat generic and the Temp directory is a common place for malware to store files, this could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nBut again, without more context, it's hard to be certain. However, the fact that multiple DLLs are being loaded and then deleted by different processes might be worth investigating further. The classification here would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7, as there are enough suspicious elements to warrant further investigation, even if they might be legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DLLs are loaded from a temporary directory by DismHost.exe, a legitimate process, but the combination of numerous non-standard provider DLLs (e.g., 'TransmogProvider.dll') and subsequent deletion by Dism.exe raises suspicion of potential malicious activity or anomalous behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are related to the Dism.exe process deleting files in the Temp directory under a specific UUID path. The files being deleted are all .mui files, which are typically Microsoft UI language resource files. \n\nFirst, I need to consider why Dism.exe would be deleting so many of these files. Dism is a system tool used for deploying and managing Windows images, so it's possible that during an image deployment or cleanup process, it's removing temporary language files. The Temp directory is a common place for temporary files, so maybe this is part of a legitimate operation.\n\nHowever, the fact that there are multiple deletions in a short period might be suspicious. But since all the events are from the same process and the same directory, it could be a normal cleanup. The UUID in the path suggests that this might be related to a specific session or operation, which is common in temporary files.\n\nI should check if deleting .mui files is normal for Dism. From what I recall, Dism does handle image files and might clean up temporary language files after deployment. So this might be a legitimate activity. However, if there's no corresponding creation of these files or other related events (like a deployment task), it could be a red flag. But in the given data, there's no information about other processes or events, only deletions.\n\nThe classification here depends on whether this behavior is typical.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one stands out because it's using PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to an executable in a non-standard directory: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. Then it starts that service. That's suspicious because creating a service from a non-system directory could be a sign of malware trying to persist on the system.\n\nThe rest of the events are PowerShell commands with -ExecutionPolicy Restricted, which is the default policy. The commands are mostly benign, like writing a host message or checking INF files. But the repetition of some commands might be normal, like part of a script or tool that's running multiple times.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch as a whole to determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that the first two events are identical. Both have a process command line involving PowerShell executing a script. The script is checking for specific patterns in INF files located in the Windows directory. The regex they're using looks for sections like [defaultinstall.nt...], which are typical in INF files related to driver installations. The script sets a result variable based on whether it finds those sections.\n\nNow, why would someone be scanning INF files like this? Well, INF files are used for installing drivers and other system components. If an attacker is looking for default installation sections, they might be trying to find drivers that can be exploited or to understand the system's configuration. The fact that this is done via PowerShell with the Restricted execution policy might be a red flag, but the policy is set to Restricted, which normally prevents scripts from running unless they're signed or exempt. However, the script itself isn't doing anything overtly malicious like downloading files or modifying the system. It's just checking for certain patterns.\n\nThe other events are less suspicious. The third event is about Security Group Management, which isn't obviously malicious. The fourth event mentions services.exe during a logon, which is a normal system process. The fifth is a Special Logon event with no process details. \n\nBut the key point here is the PowerShell script. While it's not directly harmful, scanning INF files in the system directory could be part of reconnaissance. The script is looking for specific sections that might indicate the presence of drivers that could be targets for exploitation. This behavior is unusual enough that it might warrant further investigation, especially if it's not part of a known legitimate process. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there's a legitimate reason for this. Maybe a legitimate tool is checking INF files for some purpose. But without more context, the presence of this script in the logs is suspicious. The repetition of the same event twice might indicate that it's part of a scan or a test, but it's still worth looking into.\n\nSo, the classification here is probably \"INTERESTING\" because the PowerShell script's activity is unusual and could be related to malicious behavior, even though it's not directly harmful. The confidence is around 0.7 because while the script itself isn't obviously malicious, the context and the action taken are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The same PowerShell command line is repeated twice, scanning INF files in the Windows directory for architecture-specific installation sections.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out what's going on here. Hmm, most of the entries are from Windows processes like services.exe, svchost.exe, and sppsvc.exe. Those are normal system processes, so maybe not a big deal. But then there are several entries with the same command line involving PowerShell and creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to a file in C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe.\n\nWait, \"objeto_ativo\" translates to \"active object\" in Portuguese. That might be a red flag. The fact that PowerShell is being used to create a new service and start it could indicate someone trying to install a backdoor or malicious software. The path mentioned is in a non-standard location like C:\\unidade_logico... which isn't a typical system directory. Usually, services are installed in more standard places like C:\\Windows\\System32.\n\nAlso, the repeated entries of the same command line suggest that this might be part of a script or automated process. The \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks in the winlog might relate to the security software or event logging, but I'm not sure. However, the key point here is the creation of a new service with a custom executable.\n\nI should check if tarefa_logico.exe is a legitimate file. If it's not recognized by antivirus or is not signed, that's a problem. The user might be dealing with a potential malware installation. The use of PowerShell for such actions is common in attacks, especially if it's obfuscated or part of a larger payload.\n\nAnother thing is that the log entries show multiple instances of the same command being executed. That could be a sign of persistence, trying to ensure the service starts every time the system reboots. The user should investigate the tarefa_logico.exe file, check its digital signature, and scan it with antivirus tools. Also, reviewing the system's event logs for any other suspicious activities around the same time would be helpful.\n\nIn summary, the main concern here is the creation of a new service using a non-standard executable, which could be malicious. The user needs to verify the legitimacy of the file and check for any unauthorized changes to the system.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a potential security incident involving the creation of a suspicious service on a Windows system. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and recommended actions:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Suspicious Service Creation via PowerShell**:\n   - A PowerShell command is repeatedly executed to create a new service named **`objeto_ativo`** (translated as \"active object\") with the binary path:\n     ```\n     C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\n     ```\n   - The command also starts the service immediately using `Start-Service`.\n\n2. **Unusual File Path**:\n   - The executable **`tarefa_logico.exe`** is located in **`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\`**, which is **not a standard Windows directory**. Legitimate system services typically reside in directories like `C:\\Windows\\System32`.\n\n3. **Repeated Execution**:\n   - The same PowerShell command appears **multiple times**, suggesting either a script or automated process attempting to persist the service across reboots.\n\n4. **Log Context**:\n   - The logs are associated with **Windows Event Logs** (e.g., \"Provider Lifecycle,\" \"Engine Lifecycle\"), which may relate to security software or event logging mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n- **Malicious Service Name**: `objeto_ativo`\n- **Suspicious Binary Path**: `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`\n- **Command Line**: \n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\"; Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Backdoor Installation**: The service could be a backdoor allowing unauthorized access to the system.\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: The repeated creation of the service suggests an attempt to ensure persistence after reboots.\n- **Malware**: The file **`tarefa_logico.exe`** may be malicious (e.g., a dropper, keylogger, or remote access tool).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Verify the Legitimacy of `tarefa_logico.exe`**:\n   - Check the file's **digital signature** (if any) and validate it against trusted certificate authorities.\n   - Use **antivirus\/endpoint detection tools** (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes) to scan the file.\n   - Analyze the file with a sandbox or static analysis tool to detect malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Investigate System Logs**:\n   - Review **Windows Event Viewer** for additional logs related to the service creation (e.g., Event ID 4688 for process creation).\n   - Check for other suspicious activities around the same time (e.g., network connections, registry changes).\n\n3. **Remove the Service**:\n   - If the service is confirmed malicious, delete it using:\n     ```powershell\n     sc.exe delete objeto_ativo\n     ```\n   - Remove the executable file from the system.\n\n4. **Audit System Integrity**:\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus software.\n   - Check for unauthorized user accounts or changes to system configurations.\n\n5. **Monitor for Further Activity**:\n   - Use tools like **Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)** or **SIEM systems** to monitor for similar events.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs strongly suggest an attempt to install a potentially malicious service on the system. Immediate investigation and removal of the suspicious service and file are critical to mitigate risks. If `tarefa_logico.exe` is confirmed malicious, the system may require a deeper forensic analysis to determine the scope of the compromise."}
