{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe and cmd.exe. The tasks mentioned are Process accessed, Process Create, and Registry value set. That's common in normal operations, but when combined with other events, it might be suspicious. \n\nLooking at the command_line for one of the cmd.exe processes: it's using REG ADD to modify the HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run key, adding an entry that points to \"C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe\". That's a classic sign of persistence mechanism, where an attacker adds a registry entry to ensure their malware runs at startup. \n\nThen there's another entry with reg.exe adding another entry to the same Run key, pointing to \"C:\\Path\\pacote_temporario.exe\". That's another red flag. Multiple entries in the Run key could mean the system is being set up to execute malicious code every time it starts.\n\nAlso, there's a file created event for modulo_padrao.txt in the user's Downloads directory. Not sure if that's malicious yet, but combined with the registry changes, it might be part of a larger attack. The winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file could be related to configuration changes, but that's more of a normal activity unless there's something suspicious in the file content.\n\nHowever, the main concern here is the multiple registry modifications using cmd and reg.exe, which are often used by attackers to establish persistence. The repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe, along with the registry changes, suggests that someone is trying to leave a backdoor on the system. \n\nEven though some events might be benign, the combination of these actions, especially the registry modifications in the Run key, is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The confidence here is pretty high because these are well-known tactics used in cyber attacks. So, I think this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Registry modifications in HKCU\\\\Run key via cmd\/reg.exe to establish persistence, 2) Repeated PowerShell process access, 3) File creation in user Downloads directory that may indicate data exfiltration or malicious payload deployment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
