{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll note it.\n\nThen there are several events about ProcessAccess and Registry value sets involving chrome.exe. Chrome accessing the registry multiple times might be normal, but repeated events could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe chrome is just updating settings or extensions.\n\nThen there's the whoami.exe process. That's a legitimate command to get user info, so that's probably normal. The command line is straightforward.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saves to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That's a red flag. Keystroke logging is a common technique for malware to capture sensitive information. The script is being executed from a path that seems to be a temporary or user-specific directory, which might be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs. While .NET components are common, loading several of them in a short period might be part of a larger malicious payload, especially if combined with the keystroke logging script.\n\nThe presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 suggests that the attacker is trying to capture keystrokes, which is a clear indicator of malicious intent. Even though some events might be normal, the combination of these specific PowerShell commands and the loading of multiple DLLs points towards a potential security threat.\n\nI should also check if there are any other suspicious activities. The other events don't seem to have any other obvious signs. So, the key points are the keystroke logging script and the multiple image loads. These together make the batch interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious scripts (e.g., 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1') to log keystrokes to temporary files, combined with frequent .NET DLL image loads, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries to spot any patterns or anomalies. Looking at the processes, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. \n\nMultiple entries have command lines that include running a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path pointing to $env:TEMP\\key.log. The paths where the scripts are located vary, but they all seem to be in different directories, which might be a red flag. The fact that the same script is being executed multiple times from different locations could indicate that someone is trying to evade detection by changing the path each time.\n\nAlso, there are events related to file creation and deletion. For example, a temporary file is created and then immediately deleted. That's sometimes done to hide the presence of malicious activity. The file names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 might be part of a script that's being tested or executed with some policy bypass.\n\nAnother thing is the registry events. There's a registry value set event, which could be part of configuring something, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it might be part of setting up persistence or modifying system settings.\n\nI also notice that some of the files are loaded from Windows Defender's directories, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That's normal, but if there's any unusual activity with those files, it could be a sign of something trying to interfere with the antivirus.\n\nHowever, there are also entries that seem benign, like the creation of a winlogbeat configuration file or a temporary text file. Those might be part of normal user activity or legitimate software installation.\n\nBut the repeated execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is concerning. That script's name suggests it's capturing keystrokes, which is a common technique in malware to steal sensitive information. Even if it's a legitimate script, the fact that it's being run multiple times from different locations without clear justification could be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the 'Execute a Remote Command' event might indicate that someone is running commands remotely, which could be part of a broader attack. The file path mentioned there is another instance of the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script, which reinforces the pattern.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions of the same keystroke-logging script, file creation and deletion, and registry changes seems to point towards potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the overall pattern is more indicative of something that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with consistent log path to $env:TEMP\\\\key.log, combined with file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, suggest potential keystroke logging activity indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these three events to determine if they're interesting or not. First, looking at each entry.\n\nThe first event is about svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows Delivery Optimization directory. Svchost is a legitimate system process, and DeliveryOptimization is part of Windows Update, so that might be normal. But I should check if the file creation is typical. Maybe it's part of regular system operations.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file in the Downloads folder might be part of setup. However, if this is a new file, maybe it's a configuration change, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThird event is powershell.exe creating a text file in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, but creating a simple .txt file isn't suspicious on its own. It could be user activity or a script, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at all together: all are file creation events. The first is in a system directory, which might be normal. The others are in user directories. None of the files seem to be executable or have suspicious names. No mention of network activity, privilege escalation, or other red flags. The processes involved are legitimate. So, maybe these are just normal user activities or setup steps. Not enough evidence for malicious behavior. So classification might be NOT INTERESTING. But confidence isn't 100% because sometimes even normal activities can be part of an attack. But with the given info, no clear signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) creating files in expected locations (system directories, user Downloads folder). No suspicious file types, unusual paths, or indicators of compromise observed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
