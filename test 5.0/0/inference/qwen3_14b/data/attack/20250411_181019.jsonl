{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking through the processes, there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe and cmd.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes, so that's a red flag. Then there's the cmd.exe command line that includes creating a service with a path pointing to a non-existing script: \"c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\" and \"c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1\". The fact that the scripts don't exist might indicate that the attacker is trying to execute something that isn't there, which could be a sign of a failed attack or a misdirection.\n\nAnother thing is the use of sc.exe (Service Controller) to create and query a service named \"win32times\". Creating a service with a command that starts a PowerShell script is suspicious. Also, the repeated registry value set events by services.exe and other processes might indicate attempts to modify system settings or inject code.\n\nThere are also Image Load events for urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate DLL, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a problem. However, in this case, the logs don't show any obvious signs of malicious loading.\n\nThe presence of multiple ProcessCreate events for sc.exe and cmd.exe with commands that reference non-existent files suggests that someone is trying to execute scripts that aren't present. This could be an attempt to hide the actual malicious activity or a failed attempt. Additionally, the repeated registry modifications might be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of successful malicious activity here. The events are more indicative of suspicious behavior that might warrant further investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no confirmation of actual malicious code execution, but the combination of these events does point towards potential security issues.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated PowerShell and cmd.exe executions with non-existent script paths, service creation attempts (win32times), and registry modification events. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior attempting to execute payloads or establish persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. The main thing here is that I have to look at all the events together, not just individual ones.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file called .winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal, maybe part of an installation or configuration. But then there are a bunch of other events. The next ones involve ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe changing registry values. Then there's chrome.exe with a lot of registry changes and image loads. \n\nWait, chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate files, right? Amsi is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. But why so many registry changes? Maybe that's normal for Chrome, but maybe not. However, the other processes like Calculator.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe changing registry values don't seem right. Usually, those processes aren't modifying the registry. \n\nAlso, there's a lot of events from chrome.exe, but none of them seem to be suspicious. The first event is about winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. If that's part of a normal setup, maybe not. But the other events... Maybe someone is trying to modify the registry through different processes. However, the justification for being interesting would need to be more concrete. \n\nWait, but the first event is a file creation in the Downloads folder. Maybe that's a red flag. But then again, if someone is installing software, that's normal. The other events don't show any obvious malicious activity like process creation from unexpected paths or network connections. The registry changes are just set events, but without knowing the specific keys or values, it's hard to tell. \n\nHmm. The presence of multiple registry changes by non-system processes might be suspicious, but maybe not enough. The confidence here is a bit low. Maybe the classification is not interesting because there's no clear malicious activity. The events don't show any clear signs of exploitation, data exfiltration, or malware. The chrome.exe events are normal, and the others are either benign or not enough data. So I think the classification would be NOT INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activity including legitimate process behavior (e.g., Chrome loading Windows Defender DLLs) and standard configuration file creation. No suspicious patterns like unauthorized access, malware indicators, or anomalous registry modifications are evident across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
