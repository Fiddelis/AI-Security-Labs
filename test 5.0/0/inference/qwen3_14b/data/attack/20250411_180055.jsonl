{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking through the logs, most of them involve PowerShell processes using the Compress-Archive command. The command line parameters show that they're compressing various directories into temporary files like objerto_comum.zip, registro_principal.zip, etc. The paths being compressed are all under different directories, but the pattern is consistent: they're taking a specific folder and zipping it into the TEMP directory with a .zip file.\n\nNow, the winlog tasks include things like Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, Pipeline Execution Details, and Executing Pipeline. These are all related to PowerShell operations. However, none of the events seem to indicate any malicious activity directly. The files involved are either PowerShell modules or system files like urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate system component.\n\nWait, but there's a lot of PowerShell activity here. Compressing files is a normal operation, but if this is part of a larger attack, like exfiltrating data, it could be suspicious. However, the logs provided don't show any network activity or attempts to send the zipped files out. They just show the compression happening. Also, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file might be related to logging, but that's a normal process for a log shipper.\n\nThe other events involve Registry value sets and process accesses, but again, without more context, these are common system events. The fact that multiple compressions are happening might be normal if the system is performing backups or other routine tasks. However, the repetition of the same command across different directories could be a red flag if there's no clear reason for it. But since there's no additional information, like network traffic or unusual user behavior, it's hard to tell.\n\nConsidering all this, the events are all related to legitimate PowerShell operations and system processes. There's no direct evidence of malware or attacks. So, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear malicious activity indicated in the logs. However, if the user is concerned about unusual PowerShell activity, it might warrant further investigation. But based on the given data, the confidence is medium-low since the events are normal.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve standard PowerShell compression operations and legitimate system processes. No malicious activity, unusual patterns, or security-relevant anomalies are detected in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess task. Not too suspicious yet. Then there's whoami.exe being created, which is a normal command to check user identity. But then there are multiple instances of powershell.exe again, some with ProcessAccess and others with Registry value set. Hmm, registry changes could be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys, but just setting a value isn't necessarily bad. \n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe command line that's compressing a directory into a zip file in the temp directory. That seems normal, but the path has some odd names like \"elemento_secundario\" and \"unidade_comum\" â€“ maybe obfuscation? Then there are multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs. Loading clr.dll and mscoree.dll is normal for .NET applications, but maybe if they're being loaded from unexpected locations? Wait, the paths here are standard Windows directories like C:\\Windows\\System32 and C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET, so that's probably okay. \n\nThen there's a FileCreate and FileDelete event for a temporary script file. That's common during PowerShell execution, especially if the script is being run and then cleaned up. However, the fact that the file is created and then immediately deleted might be part of a normal process, but sometimes attackers do that to hide their activities. \n\nLooking at the command lines again, all the Compress-Archive commands are using paths that have a mix of Portuguese and English terms, which might be a sign of obfuscation or an attacker trying to blend in. Also, the repeated use of Compress-Archive could be part of an exfiltration attempt, where data is compressed and sent out. But wait, the logs don't show any network activity, just file operations. \n\nThe ImageLoad events include MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so that's probably not a threat. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoads for .NET components might indicate that PowerShell is being used to run .NET code, which is a common technique in attacks. \n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes, registry modifications, file creation and deletion, and loading of .NET DLLs. While some of these are normal, the combination could indicate a malicious activity, especially if the registry changes are related to persistence or the compression is part of data exfiltration. However, without seeing network activity or more suspicious registry key changes, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut wait, the command lines show that they're compressing specific directories into temp files. If those directories contain sensitive data, this could be an attempt to steal information. However, the logs don't provide enough context on what's being compressed. The use of obfuscated paths might be a red flag. \n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say it's somewhat suspicious but not definitively malicious. The justification would be the repeated PowerShell activity, registry changes, and file operations that could be part of an attack. But since there's no clear evidence like network connections or known malicious files, it's on the edge. Maybe INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in temp directories, and repeated use of Compress-Archive on obfuscated paths may indicate data exfiltration or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of svchost.exe performing registry value sets. That's normal because svchost.exe is a standard Windows process that hosts various system services. However, seeing it multiple times might not be a red flag on its own.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Urlmon.dll is part of Windows, so that seems legitimate. But I should check if there's any unusual activity here. Not seeing anything immediately wrong here.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. The path seems standard, but maybe the user is setting up a new instance. Not suspicious yet.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe and powershell.exe doing registry modifications. PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, but if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that could be a sign of something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The same with ApplicationFrameHost.exe; it's a normal process for some UI tasks.\n\nChrome.exe is involved in several events. It's loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are related to Windows Defender. That's expected because Chrome might interact with the antivirus. However, there are multiple registry value sets from Chrome. Maybe Chrome is being manipulated, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the whoami.exe process. That's a standard command to check the current user, so that's normal. The command line is straightforward.\n\nNow, checking for any anomalies. Are there any unexpected processes? The processes listed are all common Windows ones. The file paths mentioned are either system files or typical locations. The only thing that stands out is the repeated registry changes by Chrome and PowerShell, but that could be part of normal operations or configuration changes.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's a pattern. Multiple registry modifications by different processes, but none of them are obviously malicious. The presence of winlogbeat creating a file is normal. The Calculator and Chrome events don't show signs of malware. No unusual file paths or unexpected processes. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the events don't show any clear signs of malicious activity. They are all within the realm of normal system operations. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no strong evidence of a security incident here. The confidence is medium because while there's no obvious threat, the repeated registry changes could be worth a closer look, but not enough to flag it as interesting without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve standard system processes (svchost.exe, chrome.exe, powershell.exe) performing typical operations (registry modifications, image loading). No suspicious file paths, unexpected processes, or indicators of compromise are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
