{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a lot of activity around powershell.exe and cmd.exe. The tasks include ProcessAccess, ProcessCreate, and ImageLoad. The command lines for some of these processes look suspicious. For example, one of the cmd.exe commands is using powershell with the -exec bypass parameter and a base64 string. That's a common tactic in malware to execute obfuscated scripts.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard system files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a bit odd because if the process is loading a defender DLL, maybe it's trying to bypass or interact with the antivirus. But I need to check if that's normal behavior.\n\nAnother point is the FileCreate and FileDelete events. A temporary file is created and then immediately deleted. That could be a sign of a script being executed temporarily and then cleaned up to avoid leaving traces. The filename includes __PSScriptPolicyTest, which might be related to PowerShell execution policy testing, but combined with the other events, it's suspicious.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, which might be used for inter-process communication. Not inherently bad, but in combination with other activities, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe is normal for checking user context, but when combined with the other malicious-looking commands, it might be part of a privilege escalation attempt.\n\nI should also consider the frequency of powershell.exe being accessed and created. Multiple ProcessCreate and ProcessAccess events for the same process could indicate automated or malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the confidence level, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell commands, loading of potential malicious DLLs, temporary file creation and deletion, and the use of bypass parameters suggests a high likelihood of a security incident. However, some of the DLLs are legitimate, so it's not certain. But the overall pattern points towards something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including obfuscated command execution (-exec bypass -e with base64 payload), temporary file creation\/deletion, and loading of potential malicious DLLs (e.g., MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender).

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: PowerShell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a common place for scripts to run at startup, which could be a red flag if it's unexpected. Then there's a registry value set by PowerShell, which might indicate changes to the system's configuration.\n\nNext, CompatTelRunner.exe loaded amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is related to antivirus, but loading it might be normal. However, MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, so maybe that's okay. But then there's taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is part of Task Scheduler. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nLooking further, svchost.exe set a registry value. Svchost is a normal host process, but changes in the registry could be concerning. Then there are multiple ProcessAccess events for PowerShell, which might indicate someone trying to access or manipulate processes.\n\nThe key event here is the PowerShell process with a command line that downloads a script from a GitHub URL. The URL is raw.githubusercontent.com, which is common for hosting scripts, but the fact that it's being downloaded and executed by PowerShell could be malicious. The script name is WinPwn.ps1, which sounds like a payload. This is a strong indicator of a potential attack, especially since it's using the 'iex' (Invoke-Expression) cmdlet to execute the downloaded script. That's a common technique in PowerShell-based attacks.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .NET assemblies. That's normal for PowerShell, but the combination with the download and execution might be part of a larger attack. The file creation and deletion in the Temp directory could be part of cleaning up after executing the script.\n\nOther events like Pipe Created and File Delete might be part of the attack's cleanup or communication. The multiple registry changes and process accesses could indicate attempts to persist or modify system settings.\n\nConsidering all these points, the presence of downloading and executing a remote PowerShell script, along with multiple suspicious events, suggests this is a high-risk scenario. The confidence is high because the actions align with typical attack patterns. So the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including remote script download execution (WinPwn.ps1 from GitHub), file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, and unusual registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The first few entries mention powershell.exe loading certain DLLs. The first two entries are about loading clrjit.dll and MpClient.dll. Wait, clrjit.dll is part of the .NET Framework, so that's probably legitimate. MpClient.dll is from Windows Defender, which is also a trusted component. So those might be normal system activities.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created in the user's AppData directory under PowerShell's StartupProfileData. That could be suspicious because creating files in startup locations might be part of persistence mechanisms. But I need to check more.\n\nLooking further, there are several entries with the same command line: powershell -exec bypass -e followed by a base64 string. The -exec bypass is a red flag because it's used to bypass execution policies, which is common in malicious scripts. The base64 encoded string might be obfuscated PowerShell code. Also, there's a command line that uses iex (Invoke-Expression) with a WebClient downloadstring from a GitHub URL. The URL points to a WinPwn.ps1 script. That's definitely suspicious because downloading and executing scripts from external sources, especially with names like WinPwn, is a common attack technique.\n\nThe repetition of these commands across multiple events suggests an automated or persistent attempt to execute malicious code. Even though some entries have 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks, which might be part of legitimate processes, the combination with the download and execution from an external source is concerning. Also, the presence of the same command line multiple times indicates a possible attack pattern.\n\nHowever, there are also some entries with 'None' for process, winlog, or file, which might be noise or incomplete logs. But the key here is the repeated use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from a remote URL, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The classification should be 'INTERESTING' because these events collectively suggest a potential security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute obfuscated commands to download and run scripts from a remote GitHub repository (WinPwn.ps1), bypassing execution policies.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first entry, there's a process with a command line that includes powershell.exe executing a script from a GitHub URL. The command uses iex and downloads a script from raw.githubusercontent.com. That URL path has a specific commit hash, which might be a known malicious script. The script name is WinPwn.ps1, which I've heard before in the context of penetration testing tools. However, the presence of sensitivefiles and -noninteractive flags might indicate it's being used for some automated task, but the fact that it's downloading a script from an external source could be a red flag.\n\nThen, I see this same command line repeated in several other entries. There are multiple instances where the same PowerShell command is executed, each time associated with different winlog tasks like 'Engine Lifecycle', 'Provider Lifecycle', etc. The repetition of the same command across different tasks might indicate that this is not a one-off event but part of a larger pattern.\n\nOther entries have processes set to None and tasks like 'User Account Management', 'Special Logon', and a lot of 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks. However, the ones with the PowerShell command are more concerning. The fact that the same malicious-looking script is being executed multiple times, even if the other entries are normal, could be a sign of a persistent attack or a script that's being run repeatedly.\n\nI need to check if the script from that GitHub link is legitimate. The URL seems to be part of a public repository, but the commit hash is specific. If that commit is associated with malicious activity, then it's a problem. However, without knowing the exact content of the script, it's hard to say. But the method of execution—using PowerShell to download and execute a script—is a common technique used by malware, so that's suspicious.\n\nThe other entries with 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks might be normal if they're part of legitimate remote management tools, but the combination with the PowerShell script is worrying. Also, the repetition of the same command in different log entries suggests that this isn't an isolated incident.\n\nSo, the classification here would be \"INTERESTING\" because there's a repeated attempt to execute a PowerShell script from an external source, which is a common indicator of compromise. The confidence is high because multiple events show the same behavior, even though some entries are neutral. The justification is the repeated execution of a potentially malicious script from a remote URL, which is a strong indicator of suspicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show the same PowerShell command downloading and executing a script from a GitHub URL (WinPwn.ps1), which is a known penetration testing tool but could indicate malicious activity when used in this context.
