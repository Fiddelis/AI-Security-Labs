That's common, but when combined with certain activities, it can be a red flag. Let me check the specific tasks and files involved.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks: there's \"Pipe Created\", \"Image loaded\", \"Process accessed\", \"File created\", and \"Process Create\". The image loads include several .dll files from .NET Framework and Windows Defender. The file creation events show PowerShell creating files in system directories like System32 and Temp. One of the files created is \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_wf5ajhez.sfd.psm1\" in the Temp folder. That might be a script file, which could be suspicious if it's being created by PowerShell without user interaction.\n\nAnother event has a command line for PowerShell that's running a script. The command checks INF files for certain patterns. The script is using Get-Item and Get-Content to look for defaultinstall sections in INF files. The purpose here might be to check for drivers or installations, but the fact that it's being done via PowerShell with a complex command could be part of a larger malicious activity, like checking for vulnerabilities or preparing for exploitation.\n\nThe repeated image loads from .NET and Defender DLLs might be normal, but combined with the file creation and process access events, it could indicate that PowerShell is being used to execute scripts or load assemblies that are not typically part of normal operations. Also, the use of \"Restricted\" execution policy might be a way to bypass certain restrictions, though that's a default setting, so maybe not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for system files and the creation of temporary files could be signs of something trying to inject code or run scripts in a stealthy manner. The fact that the script is checking INF files might be part of a larger attack, such as looking for system configurations to exploit.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows PowerShell being used to create files, access processes, and load various DLLs. While some of these activities are normal, the combination of multiple suspicious events, especially the creation of a script file in Temp and the execution of a complex PowerShell command, might indicate potential malicious behavior. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the number of events and the types of actions, it's worth further investigation.

However, the fact that they're being detected as executable files by the rule might be a red flag. Normally, .mui files are not executables but resource files. The rule FileExecutableDetected might be triggering because the system is flagging these files as executable, which could be a sign of something unusual.\n\nBut wait, Dism.exe is known to work with various provider DLLs during system imaging and deployment. The presence of multiple provider DLLs in the Temp directory might be part of a legitimate process, like applying updates or deploying an image.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple files detected by Dism.exe. The files are all .dlls in the Temp directory under a unique GUID folder. The names like SetupPlatformProvider.dll, SmiProvider.dll, etc., seem a bit generic, but the fact that they're being detected as executable files by the FileExecutableDetected rule might be a red flag. Typically, .dll files are libraries, not executables, so maybe that's an anomaly.\n\nThen there's the DismHost.exe process. The command line shows a GUID and a path in the same Temp directory. The ImageLoad events for DismHost.exe and various DLLs are all from that same Temp folder. Now, Dism and DismHost are legitimate tools used for Windows imaging, but they usually operate on system files, not in the Temp directory. Also, the presence of multiple DLLs being loaded from Temp might indicate that something is trying to execute code from there, which is suspicious.\n\nWait, but sometimes legitimate processes do use Temp directories for temporary files. However, the combination here is that Dism.exe is detecting these files as executables, and then DismHost is loading DLLs from the same location. Also, the GUID in the path is a common tactic for malware to obscure the file name, making it harder to detect. \n\nAnother point is that all these files are in the same directory, which might be a sign of a staged attack where files are dropped and executed in sequence. The fact that multiple DLLs are being loaded by DismHost.exe could be part of a larger payload. However, I should also consider that DismHost.exe is a legitimate process, so maybe this is just a normal operation. But why would Dism.exe be detecting these files as executables? That might be a false positive, but the repetition and the location in Temp could be signs of something malicious.\n\nI need to check if the files are known good. If these DLLs are part of a legitimate Windows update or installation process, then it's okay. But if they're not, then it's a problem. Since the names don't match standard Windows DLLs, that's a concern. For example, SetupPlatformProvider.dll isn't a standard name. Also, the fact that they're all in the Temp folder suggests they might be temporary files, but the execution of them by Dism might be abnormal.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of Dism and DismHost processes interacting with multiple DLLs in the Temp directory, the detection of .dll files as executables, and the use of a GUID in the file path all point towards potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about the DismHost.exe process loading various DLL files from a temporary directory. The paths all start with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\... which is a common temporary storage area. However, the fact that multiple DLLs are being loaded by DismHost.exe might be suspicious. Normally, DismHost.exe is part of the Windows Deployment Imaging Service and is used for managing Windows images. But loading a bunch of different providers could be part of legitimate operations, like system deployment or imaging. But then again, attackers sometimes use legitimate processes to load malicious DLLs.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where Dism.exe deletes some of these DLL files. The files being deleted are AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, CbsProvider.dll, and DismCore.dll. The deletion is logged under the FileDeleteDetected rule. Now, if these files were part of a legitimate process, their deletion might be normal. But if they were just loaded and then deleted, that could be a sign of something malicious. For example, an attacker might inject malicious code into a DLL, use it temporarily, and then delete it to avoid leaving traces.\n\nAnother thing to note is that all the loaded DLLs have similar naming patterns, like Provider.dll. This might indicate that they are part of a set of providers used by DismHost.exe. However, the presence of multiple such files in the temp directory could also be a red flag. Legitimate processes usually don't load so many different DLLs from temp folders unless it's part of a specific operation. But if these DLLs are not standard ones, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided the actual content of the DLLs. So I can't check if they're malicious. However, the combination of loading multiple DLLs from temp and then deleting them might be suspicious. Also, the fact that Dism.exe is deleting these files could be part of a cleanup process, but if the files were just used temporarily, that's normal. However, if the files are being loaded and then deleted quickly, it might be an attempt to hide malicious activities.\n\nAnother angle: the use of the temp directory. Attackers often use temp directories to store malicious files temporarily. If these DLLs are being loaded from there, it's a common tactic. But again, DismHost.exe is a legitimate process, so it's possible that this is part of a legitimate operation. However, the sheer number of DLLs being loaded might be unusual. For example, if DismHost.exe is loading 12 different DLLs, that's a lot. I should check if that's normal for DismHost.exe. From what I remember, DismHost.exe does use various providers, but I'm not sure if that many would be loaded in one go. It might be worth looking into.\n\nAdditionally, the deletion events are from Dism.exe. If Dism.exe is part of the same process or related, then deleting the DLLs after use could be normal. But if the deletion is happening without proper context, it might be a sign of something else. However, without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple DLLs loaded by a legitimate process from a temp directory, followed by their deletion. This could be either legitimate or malicious. The key here is that the combination of loading many DLLs from temp and then deleting them might be suspicious. However, since DismHost.exe is a legitimate process, it's possible that this is part of a normal operation. But the fact that there are so many different providers being loaded and then deleted might indicate that something is off. \n\nI think the confidence here is medium. It's not a clear-cut case of malware, but the pattern is unusual enough to warrant further investigation. So, I'd classify this as \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.65. The justification would be the combination of loading multiple DLLs from temp and subsequent deletions, which could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DLLs are loaded by DismHost.exe from a temporary directory, followed by their deletion via Dism.exe.

However, if it's deleting its own files, maybe that's part of a normal operation. But why so many deletions? Also, the fact that there's a mix of .dll and .mui files, which are typically part of the system's localization and functionality. \n\nHmm, but if these files were created by Dism and then immediately deleted, that might be part of a normal cleanup. However, if the deletions are happening in a way that's not typical, like deleting critical files or if there's an unusual number of deletions, that could be a red flag. \n\nI should check if there's a pattern here. All the events are from the same process, Dism.exe, and the same directory. The UUID suggests a specific session or operation. Maybe this is part of a system update or repair, which could involve deleting old files. But I'm not sure. \n\nAnother angle: the presence of multiple deletions might be part of a legitimate process, but if there's no corresponding creation of these files, that could be an issue. However, one of the logs mentions a file creation time change for DismHost.exe. That might be part of the process. \n\nBut I need to consider if this is unusual.

However, since the user is asking if the batch is relevant for investigation, and given that all events are from the same process and same directory, it might not be a strong indicator of malicious activity. \n\nSo, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it's a legitimate process performing normal operations, but I'm not 100% sure.

The first few entries mention things like \"Pipe Created,\" \"Image loaded,\" and \"File created.\" The image loaded entries point to clrjit.dll and MpClient.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created in the user's AppData directory. That could be suspicious because creating files in user-specific locations might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nNext, there are registry value set and process accessed events. Those could indicate attempts to modify system settings or access other processes, which might be malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Then there are several entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. The command lines here are interesting. They show powershell.exe running with -ExecutionPolicy Restricted, which is a bit odd because Restricted is the default and usually doesn't allow scripts. But the commands themselves are simple, like Write-Host, which is just outputting text. However, there's a more complex command that scans INF files for specific patterns. That might be checking for driver installations or something related to system configuration. \n\nWait, the INF files are part of Windows setup, so checking them might be part of a legitimate process. But why would someone use PowerShell for that? Also, the repeated entries of the same command might indicate that this is being done multiple times, possibly as part of a script or a tool that's scanning the system. \n\nLooking at the confidence level, the presence of multiple events related to PowerShell, file creation in user directories, and scanning INF files could be signs of either benign activity or something more malicious. However, the commands themselves don't show obvious malicious intent like downloading files, executing payloads, or modifying critical system files. The use of Restricted execution policy might be a red herring since it's the default. \n\nBut the combination of creating files in AppData, accessing registry, and process access could be part of a larger attack. However, without more events like network connections, unusual process creations, or lateral movement, it's a bit hard to be certain.

It seems like there are multiple process events logged, mostly related to PowerShell and other system processes. The user is probably looking for an analysis of these events to detect any suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each entry one by one. The first few entries are about services.exe, sppsvc.exe, and svchost.exe. These are typical system processes, so they might be normal. The Registry value set events could be part of standard system operations, but I should check if there's any unusual modification.\n\nThen there's the whoami.exe command, which is used to display the user's identity. That's a common administrative tool, so not necessarily malicious. However, the subsequent PowerShell commands are more interesting. The command line shows a Remove-Item command deleting files in the Temp directory. The use of $env:Temp is standard, but deleting files might be part of a cleanup, or it could be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nLooking at the Image loaded events for PowerShell, the loaded DLLs include mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET. These are part of the .NET runtime, so they're expected. However, the presence of the Windows Defender DLL (MpOAV.dll) could be a red flag if it's not a standard component, but I think MpOAV is part of Defender's real-time protection.\n\nThe File created and then deleted events for the PowerShell script in the Temp directory are noteworthy. Creating a script and then deleting it might be an attempt to execute it without leaving traces. However, since the file is deleted, it's harder to analyze. The script's name is something like __PSScriptPolicyTest..., which might be a test script, but the deletion could be suspicious.\n\nI should consider the sequence of events. The PowerShell process is creating a script, then deleting it. This could be part of a malicious activity where the script is executed and then removed. However, without seeing the content of the script, it's hard to confirm. The use of Remove-Item with -Force suggests that the user is trying to delete files even if they're in use, which might be a sign of an attempt to evade detection.\n\nAnother thing to note is the multiple Image Load events for PowerShell. Loading several DLLs is normal, but if any of these DLLs are not standard or are from unexpected locations, that could be a concern. However, the paths listed are all standard system directories, so they seem legitimate.\n\nThe Registry value set events might be part of normal operations, but if there's a change to critical keys or unexpected values, that could be a problem. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn summary, the most suspicious parts are the deletion of the script in the Temp directory and the use of PowerShell for potentially malicious activities. The user should check if the script's content was malicious and ensure that there are no other unexpected processes or registry changes. It's also important to verify if the user has proper permissions and if the activity aligns with their usual behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a series of system and process events, with a focus on PowerShell activity. Here's a breakdown of the key observations and potential implications:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Normal System Processes**\n- **`services.exe`**, **`sppsvc.exe`**, and **`svchost.exe`** are standard Windows system processes. Their associated **Registry value set** events are likely part of routine system operations (e.g., service configuration, updates). No immediate threats are evident here.\n\n---\n\n### **2. PowerShell Activity**\n- **`whoami.exe`**: Used to retrieve user identity. This is a common administrative tool and not inherently malicious.\n- **`powershell.exe`** is involved in multiple events, including:\n  - **File creation and deletion**:\n    - A script file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` is created in the **`Temp`** directory and immediately deleted.\n    - **Suspicious Pattern**: Creating and deleting a script file in `Temp` could indicate **evidence cleanup** after execution. This is often seen in malicious activities to avoid detection.\n  - **Image Load Events**:\n    - PowerShell loads standard .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`). These are legitimate for PowerShell execution.\n    - **`MpOAV.dll`** (part of Windows Defender) is also loaded. This is expected for real-time protection but could be a red flag if not part of a standard Defender update.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Potential Threat Indicators**\n- **Script Deletion**: The creation and deletion of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` raises concerns. While the name suggests a test script, the deletion might be an attempt to **remove traces** of execution.\n- **PowerShell Usage**: PowerShell is a powerful tool, and its use for file manipulation (e.g., `Remove-Item`) could be part of **malicious workflows** (e.g., data exfiltration, lateral movement).\n- **Lack of Script Content**: Without the actual script content, it's challenging to confirm its purpose. However, the context (Temp directory, deletion) warrants further investigation.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommendations**\n- **Check Script Content**: If the script was executed, analyze its contents for malicious commands (e.g., network connectivity, file encryption, credential theft).\n- **Monitor PowerShell**: Use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **EDR solutions** to track script execution and detect anomalies.\n- **Review Registry Changes**: Investigate the **Registry value set** events for modifications to critical keys (e.g., `HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`).\n- **Verify User Context**: Ensure that the user executing these actions has **appropriate permissions** and that the activity aligns with their role.\n- **Check for Evasion Techniques**: The use of `Temp` directory and file deletion may indicate **evasion** (e.g., avoiding log retention). Correlate with other logs (e.g., network traffic, process tree).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\nWhile many events are legitimate system behavior, the **PowerShell script creation and deletion** in the **Temp directory** is a **high-priority alert**. This could be part of a **malicious operation** (e.g., post-exploitation cleanup). Further analysis of the script content, user context, and network activity is required to confirm benign or malicious intent."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. There are multiple entries here, so I need to analyze them all together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are two distinct PowerShell commands being executed repeatedly. The first one is scanning INF files in the Windows directory for specific patterns related to defaultinstall sections for different architectures. The command is using Get-Item to retrieve INF files and then checking their content with a regex match. The output is a result of 0 or 1 based on whether the pattern is found. This seems suspicious because scanning system INF files might be part of an attempt to find drivers or configuration files that could be exploited. However, I need to check if this is a legitimate activity or something malicious.\n\nThen there's another command that's repeatedly trying to remove a zip file named *entrada_principal.zip from the Temp directory. The use of Remove-Item with the Force parameter could indicate an attempt to delete files without confirmation, which might be part of cleaning up after an attack or removing evidence. The repetition of these commands across multiple log entries might suggest that this is part of a larger process, possibly automated.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, some entries are under 'Provider Lifecycle' and others under 'Engine Lifecycle'. I'm not entirely sure what these tasks refer to, but the repetition of the same commands in different tasks might indicate that the process is being triggered by different components or services, which could be a red flag.\n\nNow, considering the combination of these events. The first command scanning INF files might be checking for specific configurations, perhaps looking for vulnerabilities or trying to identify system components. The second command deleting the zip file could be part of an attempt to remove malicious payloads or data. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if these are legitimate activities or part of a security test. But the fact that these commands are repeated multiple times and involve system files and temporary files raises some flags.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of false positives. For example, the first command might be part of a legitimate diagnostic tool or script that checks system configurations. The deletion of the zip file might be part of a routine cleanup. However, the use of PowerShell with these specific commands and the repetition might still be concerning.\n\nOverall, the combination of scanning system INF files and deleting temporary zip files multiple times could be indicative of malicious activity, especially if these actions are not part of a known legitimate process. The confidence here is moderate because while the actions are suspicious, without additional context or indicators of compromise, it's not definitive. However, the repetition and the nature of the commands do lean towards being interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated PowerShell commands scanning INF files for architecture-specific patterns and deleting temporary zip files, which may indicate malicious activity or system probing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
