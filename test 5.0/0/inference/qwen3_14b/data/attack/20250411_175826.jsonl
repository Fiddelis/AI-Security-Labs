{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. But then I see several entries involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities.\n\nLooking closer, there's a process creation event for powershell.exe with a command line that seems odd. The command is modifying the last write time of a file to a specific date. That might be an attempt to tamper with file timestamps, which is suspicious. Also, there are multiple image load events for various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. Loading .NET DLLs might be normal, but the combination with other events could be a sign.\n\nThen there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic used by malware to avoid leaving traces. The file name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be a misleading name to appear benign. Also, there's a pipe created event, which could be used for inter-process communication, possibly for hiding malicious activities.\n\nOther events include process access and registry changes by powershell.exe and other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe. However, the most concerning parts are the file tampering, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the PowerShell commands that modify system files. These actions could indicate an attempt to bypass security measures or execute unauthorized scripts.\n\nConsidering all these points, the presence of these suspicious activities, even if some are legitimate, when combined, suggest potential malicious behavior. So the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence level around 0.85. The justification is the combination of file tampering, temporary file handling, and multiple PowerShell activities that could be part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing file timestamp modification, temporary file creation\/deletion, and loading of .NET CLR DLLs. These patterns align with common attack techniques for persistence and evasion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the entries are about PowerShell processes. The command lines show that they're using Get-ChildItem to access various files and then setting their LastWriteTime to a specific date, which is 1970-01-01. That's the Unix epoch, so maybe this is an attempt to modify file timestamps, possibly to hide malicious activity or manipulate logs. \n\nI notice that the paths mentioned are a mix of different directories, but they all seem to be within the system or user directories. The fact that multiple PowerShell processes are doing this across different files might indicate a pattern. Also, there are entries about registry value sets by svchost.exe, which is normal for system processes, but repeated events might be a red flag. \n\nThere's also a file creation event for winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. Maybe someone is trying to configure or install it, but that's not necessarily malicious. However, combined with the PowerShell activities, it could be part of a larger scheme. \n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell commands modifying timestamps could be part of an attack to alter evidence. Since the timestamps are set to a very old date, it might be an attempt to make files appear older than they are, which could be a tactic used by attackers to avoid detection. \n\nI should check if there are any other suspicious activities. There's a calc.exe and Calculator.exe mentioned, but those are normal processes. The winlogbeat file creation might be legitimate if it's part of a setup, but without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nConsidering all these points, the repeated PowerShell commands modifying file timestamps across different locations are suspicious. This behavior is often associated with malicious activities, such as covering tracks after an attack. Even though some events are normal, the combination here points towards something that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are modifying file timestamps to 1970-01-01 (Unix epoch), which is suspicious behavior often associated with attempts to hide malicious activity or manipulate forensic evidence.

So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe have registry value set events. Registry changes can be normal, but if multiple processes are modifying the registry, that might be a red flag. However, some of these are common processes. Calculator.exe is a standard app, so maybe not suspicious. But powershell.exe is often used by attackers, so that's something to note.\n\nThen there's a Process accessed event for powershell.exe. That could indicate someone is trying to access or manipulate the process, which might be malicious. \n\nLooking at chrome.exe, there are a bunch of registry value set events. Chrome is a common browser, but if it's modifying the registry a lot, that's unusual. However, Chrome might do some registry changes for updates or settings, so not sure yet. \n\nThen there's an Image loaded event for chrome.exe with amsi.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so loading that is normal. But then there's another image loaded event with MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's Platform. That's also legitimate, but maybe the path is a bit odd? The version number is 4.18.25030.2-0, which might be a specific version. Not sure if that's a problem yet.\n\nNext, there's a file created event for winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. Creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory could be part of a configuration setup, but maybe not suspicious. However, the user might be using winlogbeat for monitoring, so that's normal.\n\nAnother file created by powershell.exe named \"unidade_logico.txt\" – that's a Portuguese term for \"logical unit,\" but maybe it's just a log file. Not sure yet. Could be benign, but the name is a bit generic.\n\nLooking at the frequency: chrome.exe has a lot of registry events. If it's modifying the registry multiple times, that's unusual. But maybe it's just a normal process with a lot of activity. However, the number of events might be high. Let me count: there are 14 entries with chrome.exe and registry value set. That's a lot. Maybe that's too much for a regular process.\n\nAlso, the presence of both amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll being loaded by chrome.exe – those are security-related DLLs. If chrome is loading them, maybe it's trying to bypass security checks? Not sure. But it could be part of normal operations if the browser is interacting with Defender.\n\nThe other entries include ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe, which are usually benign. The powershell.exe events could be more concerning, especially if they're modifying the registry or accessing processes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: the high number of registry changes by chrome.exe, combined with image loads of security-related DLLs, and the file creation by powershell might indicate something. But I need to check if these are normal behaviors. Chrome sometimes updates itself, which might involve registry changes. However, 14 registry events in a short time might be excessive. The image loads of Defender DLLs could be normal, but maybe the attacker is trying to impersonate or hook into those. \n\nAlso, the file created by winlogbeat is part of a configuration, which is normal if they're setting up logs. The \"unidade_logico.txt\" might be a log file, but the name is not standard. However, without more data, it's hard to say. \n\nConsidering all this, the presence of multiple registry changes by chrome.exe and the image loads of security DLLs might be suspicious. But I'm not 100% sure. The confidence would be medium. Maybe around 0.6. The justification would be the high number of registry events by chrome and the loading of security-related DLLs, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of chrome.exe modifying registry values (14 events) and loading security-related DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) suggest unusual behavior. Powershell.exe also shows registry modification and file creation activities, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
