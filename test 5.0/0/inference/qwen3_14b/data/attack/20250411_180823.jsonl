{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are about registry value sets, which is common in Windows. Processes like svchost.exe, chrome.exe, and others are doing registry modifications. But I need to check if there's anything suspicious here. \n\nWait, there's one event where a file is created at 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup'. That path is in the System32 directory under Tasks, which is a common place for scheduled tasks. If a malicious actor creates a task here, it could be a sign of persistence. The filename 'pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup' might be a red herring, but the location is concerning.\n\nAnother event is the creation of a file in the user's Downloads directory, 'unidade_ativo.txt' by powershell.exe. That's not necessarily malicious, but depending on the context, it could be part of something. However, the main concern is the scheduled task creation.\n\nAlso, there's an image loaded event for chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that's probably normal. But if chrome.exe is loading unexpected DLLs, that might be an issue. However, the paths here are legitimate.\n\nNow, looking at the processes involved: svchost.exe is a normal system process, but if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that might be normal too. However, the creation of a scheduled task in System32 is a bit suspicious. \n\nI should also check if there's any other unusual activity. The winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own data directory is probably part of its normal operation. \n\nSo, the key point here is the file created in the System32\\Tasks directory. That's a common place for malware to create persistent tasks. Even though there are other events, the presence of this specific file creation might indicate an attempt to establish persistence. However, without more context, like the content of the task or other malicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut considering that the rest of the events are mostly normal system processes and registry changes, the one suspicious event might not be enough on its own. However, the fact that it's in a sensitive location makes it worth investigating. So the classification should be INTERESTING with moderate confidence, maybe around 0.6. It's not a clear-cut attack, but there's enough to warrant further look into.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"A file was created in the Windows System32\\\\Tasks directory (pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup), which is a common location for malware to establish persistence through scheduled tasks. This, combined with multiple registry modification events, suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe has DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying the registry. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that's okay. Notepad modifying the registry might be a red flag, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, but again, it's a normal tool. Then calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but if it's being loaded by calc.exe, which is a simple calculator, that might be odd. But maybe it's just a normal operation. However, I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. The command line has schtasks \/create with some strange task names like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The command line uses \"calc.exe\" as the trigger. Creating scheduled tasks on logon and startup could be suspicious, especially if they're set to run with system privileges. Also, the task names have a pattern that might indicate automated or malicious creation.\n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe creating a task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same \"calc.exe\" command. This seems like an attempt to set up persistent execution. Scheduled tasks are a common method for malware to persist on a system. The fact that multiple tasks are being created with similar naming patterns and using calc.exe as the trigger is concerning. Even though calc.exe is a legitimate program, using it in this context might be a way to execute arbitrary commands.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_comum_005_OnLogon. This path is part of the system's scheduled tasks directory, which is normal, but the filename seems to be in Portuguese (\"pacote_comum_005_OnLogon\") which might indicate an attempt to obfuscate or use a non-English naming convention to avoid detection. However, that's not definitive on its own.\n\nThe repeated use of schtasks.exe and cmd.exe to create these tasks suggests an effort to establish persistence. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of creating multiple scheduled tasks with unusual names and triggering them via calc.exe could be a sign of malicious activity. The presence of multiple registry events and process accesses might be part of the setup for these tasks.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators. The logs don't show any direct file downloads or network connections to known bad IPs, but the scheduled tasks themselves are a form of persistence. Since the user is asking for classification based on the entire batch, the key points are the creation of multiple scheduled tasks with suspicious names and the use of cmd.exe to execute calc.exe as part of those tasks. This behavior is often seen in malware trying to maintain access to a system.\n\nConfidence-wise, while there's no direct evidence of malware, the pattern of activities points to potential malicious intent. So I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7. It's not 100% certain, but the combination of events raises enough flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple scheduled tasks are created with suspicious names and triggers, including 'calc.exe' execution via cmd.exe. This suggests potential persistence mechanism setup, which is commonly associated with malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. The main thing here is to look for any suspicious patterns.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There are multiple entries for chrome.exe with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry, so that's a red flag. But maybe it's normal? Wait, maybe it's part of some legitimate activity, but repeated registry changes by chrome could indicate something malicious.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe appearing in the events. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. But in the logs, there's a \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\" event for powershell, which might be normal. But the whoami.exe command is also present. Whoami is a standard tool for checking user identity, but if it's being used in a suspicious context, like part of a privilege escalation, that could be bad.\n\nNow, looking at the combination of events. Chrome modifying the registry multiple times might be an indicator of something trying to persist or change system settings. The presence of whoami.exe could be part of an attack trying to check the current user. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or the parameters of the processes, it's hard to be certain. But the repetition of the same events, especially from chrome.exe, which isn't typically involved in registry changes, makes me think this is worth investigating. The confidence isn't 100% because there's not enough data, but it's enough to flag it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe instances modifying registry values (unusual behavior for Chrome), combined with PowerShell process access events and whoami.exe execution, suggests potential malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
