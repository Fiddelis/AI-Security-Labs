The fact that this command is repeated multiple times might indicate an attempt to gather credentials or sensitive data.\n\nAlso, there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET Framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others.

That seems like someone is trying to find passwords in files. That's a red flag. But maybe it's a legitimate search? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a file creation event for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of a monitoring setup. Not immediately suspicious, but worth noting.\n\nNext, notepad.exe modifying a registry value. Not too bad on its own. Then multiple PowerShell processes accessing other processes or files. The command line in one of them is the same as the first entry, searching for passwords. Repeating that command might indicate persistence or a script that's running multiple times.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events: calc.exe and urlmon.dll. Urlmon is part of Internet Explorer, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a PowerShell process loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but maybe it's being used in a way that's not normal.\n\nThe OfficeClickToRun.exe doing a DNS query. That's part of Office installation, so probably okay. But the repeated PowerShell commands searching for passwords are concerning. If this is part of a script that's scanning the system for credentials, that's a clear indicator of malicious activity.\n\nAlso, multiple registry value changes by various processes. That could be part of configuration changes, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it might be a sign of something trying to modify system settings or install something.\n\nThe confidence here is high because the repeated use of PowerShell to search for sensitive information, along with multiple process and registry events, suggests that an attacker is trying to gather credentials or escalate privileges.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are a lot of entries where the process is chrome.exe, and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". That's a lot of registry changes. But wait, Chrome normally does some registry operations, maybe for its own settings. However, if there's a high number of these events, it might be suspicious. But I need to check if there's anything else.\n\nThen there are some DNS queries from chrome.exe. That's normal too, since Chrome would perform DNS lookups for websites. But again, the quantity might matter. However, the logs don't show any unusual domains or patterns here.\n\nLooking further, there's an entry where the process is winlogbeat.exe, and a file was created in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal if it's being set up. But the path seems to be a temporary .yml.new file, which could be part of a normal installation process.\n\nThen, there are image loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows components (Amsi is part of Windows Defender, MpOAV is related to Microsoft Defender). So loading these files is normal. However, if these were loaded from unusual locations, that might be a red flag. But the paths here are standard system directories, so that seems okay.\n\nThere's also a file created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder named \"objeto_logico.txt\". Creating a text file with PowerShell isn't inherently malicious, but depending on the context. However, without more info on the content or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, looking at the overall pattern: most events are from chrome.exe doing normal activities. There's a few other processes, but nothing that stands out as malicious. The only thing that might be a bit odd is the number of registry changes, but Chrome can generate a lot of those. Also, the presence of winlogbeat and PowerShell creating files might be part of user activities or setup.\n\nHowever, since all the events are from legitimate processes and don't show any signs of malicious behavior like unexpected network connections to known bad IPs, unusual file modifications, or privilege escalation, it's probably not interesting. The confidence here would be moderate, maybe around 0.4, because while there's a lot of activity, nothing clearly points to a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate activities from chrome.exe (registry modifications, DNS queries, network connections) and benign process behaviors (winlogbeat file creation, PowerShell text file creation).

So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, part of the Elastic stack. Maybe just normal operation. Then there's a powershell.exe creating a text file. Not too suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's an entry with process None and task None. That might be a placeholder or an error, but not necessarily malicious. Then winlogbeat.exe again creating the same .yml.new file. Maybe configuration changes? But again, could be normal.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes scheduled tasks. The command line shows deleting tasks named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks could be part of cleaning up, but sometimes attackers delete tasks to hide their activities. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there's schtasks.exe being used to delete other tasks. Again, could be legitimate if someone is managing tasks, but if done in a suspicious manner, it might be a red flag. The ImageLoad events for taskschd.dll are normal since that's a legitimate Windows file.\n\nThere are multiple ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. Process access can be normal, but if it's accessing processes that shouldn't be accessed, that's a concern. However, the events don't specify which processes are being accessed.\n\nRegistry events are also present, like Registry value set and Registry object added\/deleted. Changes to the registry can be part of malware persistence, but again, without knowing the specific keys changed, it's hard to say.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe, along with registry and process access events, might indicate some level of system manipulation. However, the presence of legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe and schtasks.exe makes it tricky. The deletion of scheduled tasks could be part of a cleanup, but could also be part of an attack.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned analyzing the entire batch as a whole. Are there any patterns? The same .yml.new file being created twice by winlogbeat.exe. Maybe configuration changes. The multiple ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe might suggest that it's being used for something more than just normal operations. However, without seeing the actual commands or more context, it's hard to be certain.\n\nThe presence of multiple events related to registry changes and process access could be indicative of an investigation-worthy scenario. But I need to balance that with the possibility that these are just normal administrative tasks. The confidence here is a bit low because there's not enough specific indicators of compromise.

The first event shows a command line using wmic to delete processes named notepad.exe. That's suspicious because wmic is often used in attacks. Then there's WMIC.exe being executed with the same command to delete notepad.exe. Also, the image loaded events point to urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, so loading that might be a red flag if it's being used in an unusual way. \n\nThere are multiple instances of registry value sets, which could indicate changes to system settings or attempts to disable security features. The use of net.exe and net1.exe to delete user accounts is another concerning point. Deleting user accounts might be part of a larger attack to remove traces or take control. \n\nThe repeated access to processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe, along with registry modifications, suggests possible lateral movement or privilege escalation. The presence of whoami.exe might be checking the current user's identity, which is common in reconnaissance phases. \n\nPutting it all together, these activities don't look normal.

The main processes mentioned are powershell.exe, cmd.exe, net.exe, sc.exe, and some others. \n\nI notice a few commands that stand out. For example, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes a user with \"net user ... \/del \/domain\". That seems suspicious because deleting a user account might be part of an attack, especially if it's done without authorization. Then there's another command using \"sc delete win32times\", which deletes a service. Deleting services could be part of removing malicious software, but it could also be an attacker trying to eliminate security tools or other services they've compromised.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry values being set. PowerShell is often used in attacks for its scripting capabilities. The fact that there are multiple registry events might indicate changes to system settings or attempts to persist malware.\n\nHowever, I should check if these actions are normal. User account management and security group management are legitimate activities, but when combined with process deletions and registry changes, it could be a red flag. The presence of both administrative tasks and suspicious commands might indicate an insider threat or a compromised account.\n\nWait, there's also a whoami.exe command, which is usually used to check the current user's identity. That could be part of privilege escalation attempts. \n\nPutting this all together: the combination of deleting user accounts, deleting services, using PowerShell and cmd.exe for administrative tasks, along with multiple registry modifications, suggests potential malicious activity.

For example, there's a 'cmd.exe' command that deletes files in the Temp directory. That could be part of a cleanup after some malicious activity. Also, the 'whoami.exe' is run, which is normal, but maybe just part of a larger process.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Registry value set' events. That might indicate changes to the registry, which is common in malware for persistence. The 'Image loaded' events point to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. That's part of the .NET runtime, so maybe PowerShell is being used to run .NET code, which isn't inherently bad, but combined with other actions could be suspicious.\n\nThere's also a lot of 'Process accessed' and 'Process Create' events for PowerShell. High frequency of these might suggest something is trying to execute multiple processes or evade detection. The 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events are a bit unclear, but they might relate to PowerShell's internal operations.\n\nThe deletion of temporary files could be an attempt to remove evidence.

There are several Image loaded events, which might be normal if they're system files, but some paths are from Windows Defender, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That seems okay, but maybe not suspicious.\n\nThen there's a File created and then immediately deleted. The file is in the Temp directory, which is common for temporary files, but creating and deleting a script file might be something. The name is __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. The \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" part might be related to PowerShell execution policy tests, which could be legitimate. But the fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might be part of a cleanup, which is normal, or it could be an attempt to execute a script and then remove it. Not sure yet.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, but no file involved. That might be part of normal communication between processes, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there are several Process accessed events. That could be normal, but if it's accessing other processes in a way that's unexpected, that might be a problem. However, the logs don't specify which processes are being accessed, so it's hard to tell.\n\nThere are also multiple instances of whoami.exe being run. That's a standard command to get user information, so if it's part of a script or testing, it's normal. But if it's being run excessively or in a suspicious context, that could be a sign of something else. However, in the logs provided, it's just the normal command line.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event is about creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's probably part of installing or configuring the tool, which is legitimate.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The main points are the PowerShell activity, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the multiple process access events. However, none of the events seem to indicate a clear attack vector. The PowerShell actions might be part of normal operations, especially if the user is testing scripts or policies. The file being created and deleted quickly could be a red herring, but without more context, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple ProcessAccess events might be normal depending on the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, if this is a system that typically doesn't have such activity, or if there are other indicators not shown here, it could be more suspicious. But with the given data, the events don't clearly point to a security incident. They might be part of legitimate system operations, like testing or configuration changes. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity.

That's a normal Windows utility, so that's probably just regular activity. Then there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' entries with 'Process accessed' events. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, but just seeing access events might not be enough. However, I should check if there's any unusual behavior.\n\nWait, there are two entries where 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' have an 'Image loaded' event pointing to 'urlmon.dll'. That's a legitimate DLL, but loading it from a process might not be suspicious. However, the fact that both Calculator and calc.exe (which is the same as Calculator) are loading it could be normal. Maybe just part of their usual operation.\n\nThen there's 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal if it's part of its setup. But the filename is .yml.new, which could indicate a temporary file during configuration updates. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nLooking at the registry events, several processes like 'svchost.exe', 'RuntimeBroker.exe', 'notepad.exe', etc., are setting registry values. That's a common activity, but if done in a way that's unusual, it could be a sign of something. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe 'chrome.exe' entries have DNS queries and network connections. Multiple DNS queries might be normal if the user is browsing, but if they're connecting to a lot of different domains, that could be a red flag.

However, without any clear signs of malicious activity like unexpected commands, unusual network traffic to suspicious domains, or file modifications that aren't standard, it's hard to classify this as interesting. The presence of legitimate processes and normal operations might mean this is just regular user activity. But I should check if there's any pattern I'm missing. The 'Image loaded' events for urlmon.dll are normal, and the winlogbeat file creation seems part of its normal operation. So maybe this isn't interesting. However, the high number of PowerShell accesses might be a hint, but not enough on its own. I think the confidence is low, but maybe there's something else.
