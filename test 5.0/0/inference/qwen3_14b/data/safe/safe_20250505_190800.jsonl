That seems normal, maybe part of an installation. Then there are several registry value set events from mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nNext, there's a process create event for powershell.exe. PowerShell is common, but then there are multiple image loaded events for various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET and Windows Defender. Loading these DLLs might be normal, but the repetition could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute and then clean up. The file name has a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting such a file quickly might indicate malicious activity.\n\nThere are also several Provider Lifecycle events for PowerShell. These might be part of normal operations, but combined with the file creation and deletion, it raises suspicion. The presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded could be a sign that the system is trying to detect something, but it's not clear.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the key points are the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script and the multiple image loads. While some events are normal, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence because the suspicious actions are present but not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes loading suspicious DLLs (e.g., clr.dll, mscoree.dll) and creating\/deleting a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1) in the AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp directory, which is commonly used by malware for persistence or execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder. That's a legitimate process, part of the Beats framework, so maybe normal. But then there's a PowerShell process creating a file called teste.ps1. That's a script file, which could be benign, but sometimes malicious scripts are named similarly. \n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe again creates the same .yml.new file. Maybe configuring something. But then PowerShell does some registry value setting. Not sure yet. Then there's a Process Create event for PowerShell with the command line showing -ExecutionPolicy Bypass and running teste.ps1. Bypassing execution policy is often a red flag because it allows scripts to run without being signed or approved. \n\nThen there are several Image Load events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including some .NET and Windows Defender ones. That might be normal, but I need to check if any of these are unexpected. The MpOAV.dll from Defender is part of the antivirus, so that's probably okay. \n\nThen PowerShell creates a temporary script file in AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is common for scripts, but then deletes it. That could be part of a normal process, but sometimes malware does this to hide traces. Also, another file is created in StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Maybe setting up a startup script? \n\nThere's also an event with \"Execute a Remote Command\" task, but the process is null. That might be an error or incomplete data. However, the presence of that event could indicate something trying to execute remote commands, which is suspicious. \n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell script execution with Bypass, creating and deleting temporary files, and the remote command execution task. These are indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of bypassing execution policies and the remote command task raises concerns. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be normal, but the combination makes it worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Suspicious PowerShell activity with execution policy bypass, temporary file creation\/deletion, and potential remote command execution detected alongside legitimate processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
