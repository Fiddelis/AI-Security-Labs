But why so many? Maybe it's part of a legitimate Office update or installation? However, the filenames have hashes which might be unique identifiers, but the repetition of the same filenames in different entries could indicate something. Wait, looking closer, some files are created multiple times. For example, the first entry is 82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b... and then the same file is created again. Wait, no, actually, looking at the paths, each entry has a different hash in the filename. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first entry has 82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b as part of the path, and then the filename is excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_86ba5bba225de51a895b0be3e7d18f6f.js. Then the next entry has the same directory path but a different filename hash. Wait, but each subsequent entry has different hashes in the filenames. However, looking at the list, some entries have the same filename. For example, the second entry is 8d60ff5953a3c5a0b82fae7df2198cbc.js, and then that same filename is created again in the third entry. Wait, but the third entry's path is the same as the second, and the same filename. So that's two events for the same file. But why? Maybe a duplicate creation? Or maybe a log duplication?\n\nWait, but the user is asking whether this batch is interesting. So, considering that SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process? I'm not sure. Maybe it's part of a Microsoft Office component. However, the fact that multiple files are being created with similar names in a specific directory might be part of a normal operation. However, the repetition of the same file creation events could be a red flag. For example, if the same file is created multiple times, that might indicate an error or malicious activity. But looking at the data, some files are created once, others twice. For example, the second and third entries are the same file, created twice. Similarly, the fourth and fifth entries are the same file. This pattern repeats. So, maybe the system is trying to create the same file multiple times, which could be an issue. Alternatively, maybe the logs are capturing multiple events for the same file creation, but that's unlikely unless there's a loop or error.\n\nAnother angle: the files are JavaScript files. If they're being created in the Office OfflineFiles directory, maybe they're part of some add-in or copilot feature. But the names include \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\", which might be related to Excel Copilot, a feature in newer Office versions. However, if these files are being created by SDXHelper.exe, which I'm not familiar with as a standard Microsoft process, that could be suspicious. Maybe SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's creating a lot of JavaScript files in that location, it might be part of some package deployment. However, the repetition of the same files might indicate that the process is trying to create them again, which could be due to corruption or intentional duplication.\n\nAlternatively, if the hashes in the filenames are unique, but the same process is creating them, maybe it's part of a legitimate package installation. However, the fact that the same file is being created multiple times (as seen in entries 2 and 3, 4 and 5, etc.) might be a problem. Maybe the process is failing and retrying, or there's a loop. But without more context, like error messages or other logs, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlso, the confidence level here: if I'm not certain, but there's a pattern that could be suspicious, maybe a mid-level confidence. However, given that the files are in a Microsoft Office directory and the process name is SDXHelper.exe (which I can't confirm as legitimate or not), but the repetition of the same file creation might be a sign of something wrong. Alternatively, maybe the logs are just showing multiple events for the same file creation, which is normal in some cases.\n\nWait, but looking at the JSON entries, each line is a separate event. If the same file is created twice, that's two separate events. However, in a normal scenario, creating a file once would be one event. Creating it again could be an error. But if it's part of an installation that requires multiple steps, maybe it's normal. However, the fact that multiple different files are being created, each with unique hashes, but by the same process, might be part of a legitimate package deployment.

However, if there's no prior knowledge of this process being part of Office's normal operations, that could be suspicious. \n\nAlso, the fact that all these events are related to JavaScript files might be relevant. JavaScript is often used in web applications, but in an Office context, maybe it's part of some add-in or copilot feature. However, if these files are being created in a directory that's not typically used for such files, that could be a problem.\n\nI should check if there are any known issues with SDXHelper.exe. If it's a legitimate process, then this might be normal. But if there's no information on it, or if it's associated with malware, that's a concern. \n\nAnother angle: the use of the FileCreate rule in winlog. This is a standard event for file creation, but if there's a high volume of such events from the same process, it might be worth investigating.

It's possible that this is part of a legitimate update or deployment process, especially if the files are related to Excel Copilot, which is a feature in Office. \n\nBut the hashes in the filenames are still a bit concerning. Maybe they're just unique identifiers, but if they're random or not matching any known good hashes, that's a problem. Since I don't have access to external databases to check the hashes, I have to rely on patterns. \n\nConsidering all this, the batch might be interesting because the repeated creation of JavaScript files with hash-based names by a helper process could indicate either a legitimate activity or a potential security threat.

SDXHelper.exe – I'm not immediately familiar with that process. Maybe it's part of some software, but I should check if it's a legitimate Microsoft process.

The repetition of the same files being created could be a sign of something abnormal.

SDXHelper.exe – I'm not too familiar with that process. Maybe it's part of some software, but the name doesn't ring a bell. Let me think about typical benign activities. Office SolutionPackages might be related to add-ins or plugins. However, the fact that multiple files are being created in the OfflineFiles directory could be part of an installation or update process. But why so many files with different hashes? That might be normal if they're different components, but it could also be a sign of malware distributing multiple payloads.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the user's AppData directory, which is common for temporary or user-specific data. However, the presence of multiple files with unique hashes might be unusual.

I should check if this is a common process. A quick search in my mind – no, I don't recall SDXHelper.exe being part of standard Microsoft Office. It might be part of a third-party application or a malicious payload. The fact that it's creating JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory could be part of a web-based add-in, but again, the sheer number and the hash-based names are suspicious.\n\nAlso, the files are being created in the PackageResources folder under SolutionPackages. If this is part of a legitimate Office solution, maybe the files are resources for an add-in. However, the use of hashes in the filenames suggests obfuscation, which is commonly used by malware to avoid detection. The repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be part of an installation, but it's also possible that the process is generating these files as part of a malicious activity, like injecting code or preparing for execution.\n\nConsidering all this, the combination of an unfamiliar process creating multiple files with hash-based names in a non-standard directory under Office's data path raises suspicion.

The first thing I notice is that the same files are being created multiple times. For example, vendors~file-link-plugin.js appears twice, and similarly for others. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe isn't a process I recognize off the top of my head. Typically, legitimate Office processes might be related to installation or updates, but the names of the files here are a bit odd. They have long, seemingly random strings in the filenames, which might be obfuscation. The paths are all within the Office SolutionPackages folder, which is part of the Office installation, but creating files there repeatedly could be suspicious.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. A quick mental note: Microsoft Office doesn't have a process named SDXHelper.exe. That makes me think this might be a malicious process. The repetition of file creation events could indicate that the process is trying to deploy or execute code in a way that's evading detection. \n\nAlso, the filenames have parts like \"vendors~\" which might be part of a package or library, but the hashes in the filenames (like 8988909c18d8bf3dd4c823acc260243c) look like GUIDs. That's common in some legitimate software, but combined with the process name and the repeated file creation, it's a red flag. \n\nAnother point: the events all have the same task \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which is a standard rule, but the fact that multiple files are being created in a short time by the same process might be indicative of a malicious payload being deployed. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any possibility of false positives. Maybe the user is installing some third-party add-in for Office that's using SDXHelper.exe. But the lack of any other process activity or user interaction mentioned in the logs makes me lean towards it being suspicious. \n\nPutting it all together, the repeated creation of files with unusual names by an unknown process in a sensitive directory suggests potential malicious activity.

SDXHelper.exe – I'm not too familiar with that exact process name. Maybe it's a legitimate part of some Office add-in or package? But the fact that it's creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory might be worth checking.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all have a structure like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\<some GUID>\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\...

But why would SDXHelper.exe be creating these files? \n\nNow, the names of the files are things like excel-copilot-strings_...js and vendors~researchnotebook.js. The \"excel-copilot\" part might be related to a feature in Excel, maybe some copilot or AI assistant functionality. However, the repetition of file creation events for the same files might indicate that the process is either legitimately updating resources or possibly maliciously dropping files. \n\nBut wait, the same file paths are repeated multiple times. For example, excel-copilot-strings_68fa3d8d421a10183f19db8ce5721015.js appears twice. Maybe that's just a normal part of the installation process where files are created multiple times, but it's also possible that this is part of a larger pattern. \n\nHowever, considering that all events are about file creation by SDXHelper.exe in the same directory structure, and given that the files are JavaScript files, which are commonly used in web applications but less so in traditional desktop software, this might be a red flag. Also, the presence of multiple packages with different GUIDs might indicate that the system is being used to install or deploy multiple packages, which could be legitimate if it's part of an enterprise setup or software deployment, but could also be a sign of a malicious payload being distributed under the guise of legitimate packages.\n\nAnother point to consider is the lack of other processes or events. All the logs are about file creation by SDXHelper.exe, no other processes are mentioned. That might be normal if it's a dedicated helper process, but it's also possible that this is the only activity from a malicious process. \n\nHowever, without additional information like process parentage, user context, or other system events (like network activity or registry changes), it's hard to be certain. But the repetition and the specific file locations might be enough to flag this as suspicious. \n\nOn the other hand, if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process associated with Microsoft Office or some other trusted software, then this could be normal. But since I don't have that context, I have to go by the data given. The fact that the same process is creating multiple JavaScript files in a non-standard location (especially under SolutionPackages) could be a sign of something unusual. \n\nI think the key here is the combination of the process name, the file locations, and the repetition.

But why so many? If this is part of a legitimate update or installation, there might be a reason for multiple files. However, the same file paths are repeated in the logs. Each entry shows the same file being created multiple times. That repetition could be a red flag. Maybe the process is attempting to overwrite or repeatedly create the same files, which isn't typical for normal operations.\n\nAlso, the files are JavaScript files.

However, the fact that they're being created by SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process, might mean that this is part of a normal update.

If this is a known legitimate behavior, then it's not interesting. But if there's no documentation about this, it might be worth investigating.

The main thing here is to analyze the entire batch together.\n\nFirst, I notice that almost all the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files named similarly, like excel-copilot-strings followed by a hash. They're located in the Office SolutionPackages directory under the user's AppData. Now, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, but creating multiple JavaScript files in that directory might be unusual. \n\nWait, but looking at the paths, they're all in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. Maybe these are part of some Office add-in or package resources. However, the repetition of the same file names with different hashes could indicate something. Are these files being created multiple times? The same file path appears in multiple entries. But maybe that's just part of the normal operation. \n\nThen there's one event involving MdSched.exe setting a registry value. MdSched is a Microsoft service, so that might be normal. But combined with the other events, is there a pattern? The main thing here is that all the file creations are from SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process. However, if there's an unusual number of files being created, or if the files are not part of a known legitimate package, that could be a red flag. \n\nBut the file names include \"excel-copilot-strings\", which might be related to a feature in Excel, like Copilot.

But combined with the file creations, maybe it's part of a larger activity. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nConsidering all this, the key points are: multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory, same file names with different hashes, and one registry event. Since SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but the volume of file creations might be unusual. However, if this is part of a legitimate Office feature (like Copilot), then it might not be malicious. \n\nBut the fact that the same file is being created multiple times (same path in multiple events) could be a sign of something wrong.

The files are all JavaScript files located in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory under the user's AppData. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but the key here is the pattern of the file creations. The same files are being created multiple times. For example, the officeaicopilotchatstrings_af_...js file is created twice, and the word-copilot.min_...js files are also duplicated. \n\nNow, why would the same file be created multiple times? That's unusual. Typically, a legitimate application wouldn't create the same file repeatedly unless it's part of some kind of update or caching mechanism. But the fact that it's happening multiple times with different hashes (like the different endings in the filenames) might indicate that the process is generating these files on the fly, possibly with malicious content.\n\nAlso, the names of the files include terms like \"copilot\" which might be related to Microsoft Copilot, but the exact filenames and the repeated creation could be a red flag. The presence of multiple entries with the same file path and name suggests that the process might be trying to inject or replace files, or maybe it's part of a larger attack.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that these could be legitimate files. For example, if the user is installing or updating Office, maybe these files are part of that process. But the repetition is still concerning. The confidence here is moderate because while the pattern is suspicious, it's not definitive. More context would be needed, but based on the given data, the repeated creation of the same files by SDXHelper.exe in a user-specific directory could be indicative of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, suggesting potential malicious activity through repeated file generation with varying hash suffixes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, all showing files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are named with patterns like officeaicopilot-strings.min_ followed by some hash, and there are also word-copilot.min_ files. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior or something suspicious. SDXHelper.exe – I'm not entirely sure what that is, but maybe it's part of some software installation or update process. However, the fact that multiple files are being created in the Office SolutionPackages folder might be related to Office add-ins or copilot features. The names of the files suggest they might be JavaScript files for some UI strings or copilot functionalities.\n\nBut wait, the same process is creating multiple files with similar names but different hashes. That could be part of a legitimate update where multiple files are being deployed. However, the repetition of the same process creating the same files multiple times might be a red flag. Also, the paths are all within the user's AppData directory, which is common for user-specific installations, but if this is happening without user consent, that's a problem.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. If it's part of Microsoft Office, then this could be normal. But if it's not, then it might be malware. However, the user hasn't provided any other logs indicating malicious activity, like network connections or registry changes. The events only show file creation. \n\nAnother thing to note is the use of hashes in the filenames. That's common in software distribution for versioning, but if the hashes are random or don't match known good files, that could be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nSince all the events are about file creation by the same process in a specific directory, and there's no other suspicious activity mentioned, maybe this is just part of a legitimate software update. However, the fact that there are so many files being created with similar names might indicate something like a dropper or a downloader, but again, without more data, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe classification here is tricky. If the process is legitimate and the files are part of a known update, then it's not interesting. But if SDXHelper.exe is not a known good process, then it's suspicious. Given that the user hasn't provided other logs, and the only events are file creations, I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with a moderate confidence. However, the repetition and the specific directory might still be worth investigating further. Maybe the confidence is around 0.6, but I need to check if there's any known malicious activity associated with these files or the process.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, suggesting potential malicious activity or unusual behavior.
