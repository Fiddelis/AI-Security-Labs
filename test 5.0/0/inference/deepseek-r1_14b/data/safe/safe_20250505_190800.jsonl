{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. First, I notice that many events involve powershell.exe processes. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it has legitimate purposes but can also execute malicious commands.\n\nLooking closer, there are multiple ImageLoad tasks from powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. While these might be part of normal operations, the fact that they're being loaded repeatedly could indicate something suspicious, especially if the same files are being accessed in a loop.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1 followed immediately by a FileDeleteDetected. This temporary script file creation and deletion might be part of a script testing phase or an attempt to bypass certain security policies, which raises red flags.\n\nAdditionally, there are PipeCreated events from powershell.exe, which can be used for communication between processes. Attackers often use pipes for command and control or data exfiltration. The multiple ProviderLifecycle and EngineLifecycle events also suggest that the script is going through various stages, potentially indicating complex activity.\n\nWhile I don't see any overtly malicious actions like writing to sensitive files or network communications, the combination of these activities—especially the repeated ImageLoad calls and the file handling—could be indicative of a potential attack. However, it's possible that this is normal script execution as well.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because of the unusual activity around powershell.exe and the specific file operations, even if there isn't clear evidence of malicious intent yet. The confidence level is about 0.75 because while these behaviors are concerning, they might also be part of legitimate processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes showing unusual activity including repeated image loading, file creation\/deletion, and pipe creation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new in its data directory. That's normal since it's likely updating its configuration file. I don't see anything suspicious here.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe creating a file called teste.ps1. PowerShell scripts can be legitimate or malicious, but without knowing what the script does, I'm not sure yet. This could be part of system administration tasks.\n\nAnother winlogbeat.exe event again creating the same .winlog.yml.new file. It seems like it's trying to write this configuration file multiple times, which might indicate an issue with the process or perhaps a retry mechanism, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen, powershell.exe sets a registry value. This is common for scripts that need persistence or configuration changes. Still, in isolation, it's hard to tell if this is malicious without context of what the script does.\n\nThe fifth event shows powershell.exe being run with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass and executing a script called teste.ps1. The ExecutionPolicy Bypass suggests that the user or something is trying to execute scripts that might be unsigned or otherwise restricted, which could be a red flag but isn't conclusive on its own. Legitimate scripts sometimes need this.\n\nNext, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are standard .NET framework components, so they're expected when running PowerShell scripts that involve .NET.\n\nThe ninth event is a FileCreate of __PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1 in the Temp directory. This seems related to PowerShell's script policy testing, which happens when certain scripts are executed for the first time. It checks if the script complies with execution policies before running it fully.\n\nThen, there's a FileDeleteDetected event for that same temp file. So after creating and possibly executing it, the script deletes itself. This is a common tactic in malware to remove evidence of its presence, but again, without seeing the content, I can't be certain. However, legitimate scripts might also delete temporary files.\n\nAnother FileCreate from powershell.exe creates a StartupProfileData file, which could be part of setting up the environment or user profile data. Not sure if that's suspicious on its own.\n\nThere's another RegistryEvent where powershell.exe sets a value again. Combined with previous registry activity, it makes me think the script is making changes to the system configuration, possibly for persistence.\n\nThe last event is an Execute a Remote Command task without any process or file information. This could mean that PowerShell is executing commands over the network, which is concerning because remote command execution can be a vector for attacks like remote code execution or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe is running scripts with bypassed execution policies, creating and deleting temporary files (potentially to avoid detection), setting registry values (possibly for persistence), and executing remote commands. These behaviors are indicative of potential malicious activity because they align with common tactics used by attackers, such as script execution with bypasses, self-deletion to cover tracks, system configuration changes for persistence, and remote command execution to establish control.\n\nWhile some events on their own might not be suspicious, the combination of several red flags makes this batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence level is high because multiple concerning activities are present.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including script execution with bypass policies, file creation\/deletion in temp directory, registry modifications, and remote command execution suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
