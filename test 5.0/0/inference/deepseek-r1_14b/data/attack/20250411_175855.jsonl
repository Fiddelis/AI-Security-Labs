{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's see what each event says.\n\nFirst line: The process is powershell.exe and the winlog task is ProcessAccess. So someone is accessing a process, maybe trying to get information or do something with it.\n\nSecond line: It's whoami.exe being executed from C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe. The task is ProcessCreate. That means the system created this process. Whoami usually gives user info, which could be part of recon or credential gathering.\n\nThird line again has powershell.exe and ProcessAccess. So that same script might be running twice.\n\nNow, thinking about the combination: Using whoami without any suspicious command-line args seems normal, but when combined with powershell.exe accesses, it raises a flag. Maybe someone is using PowerShell to run whoami to gather user info, which could be malicious activity like recon before an attack.\n\nI'm not sure if this is definitely bad, but the pattern of accessing processes and running whoami suggests possible malicious intent. So I'll classify it as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and whoami.exe being executed, which could indicate potential malicious activity such as reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and decide if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a few entries from MpDefenderCoreService.exe with network connection detections. That seems normal because Defender services often check for updates or scan networks. Not too suspicious yet.\n\nThen I notice multiple events from chrome.exe with Dns queries and Network connections. Chrome is a common browser, so it's expected to make DNS requests and establish connections. Probably just regular browsing activity.\n\nLooking further down, there are several powershell.exe entries. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first one shows 'Process accessed', which could mean it's being monitored or interacting with other processes. Then there are registry value sets in the logs. Registry modifications by scripts, especially via Powershell, can be a red flag because attackers often create persistence mechanisms through the registry.\n\nThere are also cmd.exe instances with specific command lines. The commands like 'dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key' and using findstr to look for '.key' files seem concerning. This looks like someone is searching for files ending with .key, which could be encryption keys or configuration files. Attackers often search for such files to exfiltrate data.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command runs 'dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key' without quotes correctly this time but still searching the same way. Then there's a call to findstr.exe looking for '.key', which reinforces the idea that someone is trying to locate specific sensitive files.\n\nThere are entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files, which I assume is part of log shipping or monitoring. The creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new might be normal if it's an agent updating configuration files. However, a powershell.exe creating tarefa_geral.txt could be writing to a file, maybe storing data exfiltrated earlier.\n\nConhost.exe modifying the registry also stands out because conhost is often used by attackers to host payloads or create processes without being detected easily.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of Powershell and cmd with suspicious commands looking for .key files, along with registry modifications. These activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior. The repeated attempts to search for sensitive files and use of tools known for both legitimate and malicious purposes (like Powershell) raise the confidence level that this batch is indeed interesting for investigation.\n\nI think the justification would be the combination of process creation events using cmd.exe and powershell.exe with suspicious commands, plus registry modifications, all pointing towards possible unauthorized or malicious activity. The confidence is high because several red flags are present.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Powershell and cmd with suspicious commands looking for .key files, along with registry modifications indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of log events and decide if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from different processes like winlogbeat.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, chrome.exe, etc. Each of these has an associated task and sometimes a file path.\n\nLooking at the tasks, I see a variety: File created, Registry value set, Process accessed, Image loaded, Pipe Created. Most of them are related to registry changes or loading images, which is normal for Windows processes.\n\nLet's check specific events:\n\n1. winlogbeat.exe creating a file: That seems like it's part of its normal operation, logging data.\n2. RuntimeBroker and notepad making registry changes: Common activities, especially when handling settings or configurations.\n3. powershell.exe accessing a process: PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be malicious. However, without more context on what it's doing, it's hard to tell here.\n4. calc.exe loading urlmon.dll: That's normal since many system files are loaded by various processes.\n5. svchost.exe making multiple registry changes:_svchost is a known process for services, and frequent registry access could be part of its operation but might also indicate something suspicious depending on the frequency.\n6. Calculator.exe accessing registry: Again, seems normal unless there's an unusual pattern.\n7. ApplicationFrameHost.exe making registry changes: This is typical as it's part of Windows Shell and often interacts with the registry.\n\nNow, looking at chrome.exe having multiple Registry value set events. That might seem a bit concerning since Chrome isn't typically known for heavy registry activity, but some legitimate operations do involve the registry. However, 9 instances of this could raise an eyebrow. But considering that it's possible for a browser to interact with the registry for updates or settings, maybe it's not too suspicious.\n\nI also see two ImageLoad events from chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate system files; aomi might be related to anti-malware scanning interfaces, and MpOAV is likely part of Windows Defender. So that's normal behavior.\n\nOther than that, there's no indication of any unusual file creations or deletions beyond the initial winlogbeat file, which seems benign. No network connections are logged here, so nothing pointing to data exfiltration or communication with external servers.\n\nThe process names don't show anything immediately suspicious except maybe powershell.exe and svchost.exe, but as I said earlier, without more context on their activity, it's hard to classify them as malicious.\n\nI also notice that the same events are repeated, like multiple Registry value sets by chrome.exe and svchost.exe. This repetition might be a sign of something automated or part of a legitimate process loop, but without knowing the exact reason for these registry accesses, I can't be sure they're malicious.\n\nIn summary, most of these activities seem within normal operational parameters for Windows processes. The higher number of Registry events by certain processes could be a red flag, but not enough information is provided to conclude that. Therefore, while there's some minor cause for caution, the batch as a whole doesn't present clear indicators of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activities such as process operations, registry updates, and file loads. No signs of suspicious or malicious behavior are evident.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
