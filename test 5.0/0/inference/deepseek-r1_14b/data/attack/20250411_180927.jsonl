{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see that most of the events are coming from \"chrome.exe\". There are multiple instances where chrome.exe is setting registry values, which happens often because Chrome interacts with system settings for things like extensions or themes. However, there's also an event where chrome.exe loads a DLL file (amsi.dll) and another related to Windows Defender (MpOAV.dll). Those sound legitimate since they're part of standard Windows operations.\n\nThen there are a couple of events from \"winlogbeat.exe\", which I recognize as the agent used for collecting Windows logs. It's creating some configuration files, which is normal during setup or updates.\n\nThe interesting one here is the event from \"powershell.exe\" creating a file named \"componente_secundario.txt\". Powershell is often used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute scripts. The filename doesn't immediately raise red flags, but combined with other events, it might be worth looking into.\n\nHowever, looking at all these events together, most of them are typical user activity and legitimate system operations. There's no obvious sign of malicious behavior like multiple failed login attempts, unusual file accesses, or known indicators of compromise. The powershell event could be innocent if it's part of a script for system administration, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nSo, considering the entire batch, I'd classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no strong evidence of malicious activity. The confidence is high since each individual event can be explained by normal user actions or legitimate processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly normal user activities and system operations, such as Chrome interacting with registry settings and loading legitimate system files, along with a PowerShell script creating a file which could be benign. There's no clear indication of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple instances where processes like cmd.exe and net.exe are being used with command lines that add users and modify groups. For example, the event where 'cmd.exe' is used to add a user \"modulo_geral_Admin\" with a temporary password, followed by adding \"registro_logico_Admin\" to administrators. This seems unusual because creating multiple admin accounts in quick succession could be part of privilege escalation or setting up backdoors.\n\nThere are also entries where net1.exe is used similarly, like adding users and groups. The command lines suggest these might be automated scripts trying to create several administrative accounts, which is a red flag for potential unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event involving OneDrive.exe making registry changes and loading BitsProxy.dll. While OneDrive is legitimate software, unexpected registry modifications could indicate tampering or the presence of malware attempting to hide its components.\n\nPowershell.exe appears multiple times with both RegistryEvent and ProcessAccess tasks. Powershell is often used for malicious activities because it's powerful and can execute commands without leaving obvious traces. The combination of accessing processes and modifying the registry suggests potential script execution, which could be harmful.\n\nLooking at other events, there are several instances where the process name is None but the task involves User Account Management or Security Group Management. This might indicate system-level changes that aren't tied to a specific process, possibly due to logging limitations or evasion techniques.\n\nLastly, the winlogbeat.exe creating a file seems benign unless it's part of a log tampering scheme, which could be another sign of malicious activity trying to cover its tracks.\n\nPutting all this together, these events show multiple attempts to create and modify user accounts, use command-line tools for administrative tasks, unexpected registry changes, and the use of Powershell. These patterns are consistent with potential unauthorized access or malicious behavior, making the batch highly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential unauthorized account creations and system modifications using cmd.exe, net.exe, and powershell.exe. Registry changes and user additions suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
