{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing some system activity.\n\nFirst off, I notice that most of the events involve powershell.exe being executed with command lines that set up scheduled tasks. The commands are using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask, which is a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell to create persistent backdoors. The fact that they're setting tasks at logon and targeting the Administrators group suggests they want elevated privileges.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. This is concerning because such actions can be used for persistence or to modify system configurations maliciously. The ImageLoad events in PowerShell could indicate it's loading certain libraries, which might be part of a payload execution.\n\nHowever, I also see some events from chrome.exe creating pipes and accessing the registry. These are more normal activities, especially since Chrome often interacts with the system in various ways. But the fact that they're in the same batch as the PowerShell activities makes me think someone is trying to blend malicious actions with legitimate ones to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together, having multiple instances of powershell.exe setting up scheduled tasks at logon, modifying registry entries, and loading modules seems suspicious. These are common tactics in malware and attack campaigns. The repeated use of similar command lines across different events also suggests a pattern rather than random activity.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of activities indicates potential malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistence and privilege escalation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands to create scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, combined with registry modifications and image loading, indicate potential malicious activity aiming for persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. There are multiple entries here, all in JSONL format. Let me try to break down what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events involve the process name being \"powershell.exe\". PowerShell is often used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to keep an eye on. The events show various file operations and registry changes.\n\nLooking closer, there are several entries where powershell.exe loads different DLL files. For example, it's loading clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, MpOAV.dll, and MpClient.dll. These might be normal if PowerShell is running scripts that require these libraries, but sometimes attackers use legitimate tools like PowerShell to execute malicious commands.\n\nThen there are events related to file creation and deletion. Specifically, a temporary .ps1 file is created and then deleted shortly after. The file path is C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. This seems suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection or to test if script execution policies are enforced.\n\nNext, there's an event where powershell.exe runs a command that creates a scheduled task. The command is using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe at logon time with highest privileges. This is concerning because it indicates that someone might be trying to set up a persistent backdoor using administrative rights. Scheduling tasks can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where the process is \"chrome.exe\" and it's modifying registry values. While Chrome does perform some registry operations during normal operation, multiple such events could indicate something more malicious, especially if they're not related to legitimate browser activities.\n\nThen towards the end, there are entries with \"None\" for the process name but a task of \"Execute a Remote Command\". This is odd because without a process name, it's unclear what exactly is executing. Remote command execution can be a sign of remote attacks or possibly reverse shells, which would definitely be malicious activity.\n\nPutting this all together, there are multiple red flags here: PowerShell activities that could indicate script execution and scheduled task creation, file operations that might bypass policy checks, and potentially unauthorized remote commands. These collectively suggest a possible attack or at least suspicious behavior that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including PowerShell command execution creating scheduled tasks, file creation\/deletion in temp directory, and remote command executions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, most of the logs show that 'chrome.exe' is setting registry values. That's a common activity because Chrome often modifies system settings, especially for things like extensions, themes, or preferences. So multiple entries of this might just be normal operations, not necessarily suspicious.\n\nThen there's an entry where 'winlogbeat.exe' created a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management and it's creating a configuration file here. That seems legitimate; no red flags there.\n\nNext, I see 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. PowerShell is often used by both admins and attackers because of its powerful scripting capabilities. Creating a file could be part of normal administration tasks or could indicate malicious activity like dropping files during an attack. The filename doesn't seem inherently suspicious, but the combination with other events might matter.\n\nLooking at the entire batch, I notice that most events are from Chrome modifying registry values, which is standard. There's one DNS query from Chrome, which again is normal for browsing. Then, two more events: Winlogbeat creating a config file and PowerShell creating another file.\n\nI'm thinking about whether these actions together could indicate something malicious. The use of multiple tools (Chrome, Winlogbeat, PowerShell) might seem unusual, but each individually doesn't raise a red flag. However, the number of registry changes by Chrome stands out because it's quite a few in a short time. Could that be part of a broader attack?\n\nOn one hand, maybe someone is just using Chrome extensively with extensions or settings changes. On the other hand, multiple registry writes could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. But without more context, like unusual behavior across these processes or indicators of compromise (IOCs), it's hard to say definitively.\n\nThe presence of PowerShell creating a file adds some intrigue because attackers often use it for lateral movement or command execution. However, without additional signs like network traffic anomalies or known malicious file hashes, this could still be normal admin work.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, I'm somewhere in the middle. There are elements that make me pause but not enough concrete evidence to label this batch as definitely malicious. It's possible these are just legitimate activities, especially if 'fiddelis' is a user account known for administering systems or testing scripts.\n\nSo, weighing all this, I think the batch is interesting but not conclusive. There might be something worth looking into, but more data would help confirm any suspicions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe, a DNS query, and file creation events involving powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe suggest potential malicious activity or system configuration changes worth investigating.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a lot of repeated entries where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That seems suspicious because executing remote commands can be a sign of malicious activity, like remote code execution or command-line attacks. But without more context, it's hard to tell if these are legitimate or part of an attack.\n\nThen, towards the middle, there's a process event where 'powershell.exe' is used with some command line arguments that create a scheduled task. The script being executed looks like it's adding a new scheduled task that runs calc.exe at logon, with admin privileges and highest run level. That stands out because using PowerShell to execute commands, especially creating persistent tasks, is often a tactic in cyberattacks. This could be part of persistence mechanisms where attackers ensure their malicious activities continue after a system restart.\n\nFollowing that, there are events from 'WmiPrvSE.exe' loading the taskschd.dll file and several instances of 'svchost.exe' modifying registry values. SvcHost is a common process in Windows for running services, but it's often used by malware to hide their activities because many legitimate processes run under this name. The fact that these are setting registry values could indicate configuration changes that might be malicious.\n\nAnother event shows a file being created in the Task directory named 'unidade_comum', which might not be a standard filename. It's probably related to the scheduled task created earlier, but again, without knowing the exact purpose, it's hard to say if this is normal behavior.\n\nThere are also events from 'powershell.exe' creating files and modifying registry values in user-specific directories, like the StartupProfileData folder. This could be an attempt to create persistence points or modify system configurations for malicious purposes. Additionally, processes related to Chrome loading certain DLLs don't seem suspicious on their own, but they could be part of a larger attack vector if those DLLs are malicious.\n\nFinally, there's an event from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a configuration file and another PowerShell instance creating a file in the Downloads folder. While WinLogBeat is likely a legitimate tool for log shipping, the creation of arbitrary files by scripts can sometimes be used to store malicious payloads or configurations.\n\nPutting all this together, I'm seeing multiple red flags: repeated remote command executions, suspicious scheduled tasks created via PowerShell, registry modifications by svchost and other processes, and file creations in non-standard locations. These activities collectively suggest potential malicious behavior, especially the use of PowerShell for task creation and the unusual file operations. The confidence is pretty high because several indicators point towards possible attack vectors, but I'm not entirely certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including remote command executions, scheduled task creation via PowerShell, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
