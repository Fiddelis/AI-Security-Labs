{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given this batch of JSONL events to analyze. Let me try to figure out what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the first event, it mentions \"powershell.exe\" with a command line that includes creating a new PowerShell drive targeting \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\". That looks suspicious because using PowerShell for remote access can be a red flag, especially when combined with something like creating a drive mapped to another machine. I know that sometimes attackers use PowerShell for lateral movement or executing commands on other systems.\n\nThen, the subsequent events all have \"winlog\" tasks labeled as \"Execute a Remote Command\". That's concerning because executing remote commands in bulk could indicate some kind of automation or script running multiple times, possibly part of an attack chain. The repetition here is significant—there are 18 such events after the first one. It doesn't look like normal activity; users typically don't trigger this many remote command executions in a short period.\n\nPutting it all together, the initial event sets up a PowerShell drive to access another system (maybe the Target machine), and then there's a series of attempts to execute commands remotely. This combination suggests potential malicious activity, possibly an attempt at unauthorized access or moving laterally within a network. The volume of these events also raises the alarm because it's unlikely to be legitimate.\n\nI'm not seeing any file accesses in these logs, which might mean that the attackers are focusing on command execution rather than data exfiltration. But even so, repeated remote command executions are risky and indicative of possible compromise.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the batch is definitely interesting from a security standpoint. The confidence level is high because the pattern matches known attack vectors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating remote command execution attempts following a PowerShell activity that suggests potential unauthorized access to another system.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event.\n\nThe first event has a null process and winlog, so nothing there. Then from the second event onward, every entry shows a PowerShell command being executed with specific parameters. The command line is long, but I can parse it out. It seems like they're using `powershell.exe` to execute some script downloaded from a GitHub repository. The URL points to `WinPwn.ps1`, which I remember is known malicious code used for lateral movement in attacks.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field, most events have tasks related to 'Provider Lifecycle', with a few being 'Engine Lifecycle'. These are typical Windows event log categories, but repeated under the same task suggests consistent activity from the same process. The repetition of the exact command line across multiple events indicates automated or script-driven behavior, which is often seen in attacks.\n\nThe files involved are null, so no file creation or access here, but the focus seems to be on process execution and network activity. The GitHub link is suspicious because it's a known repository for malicious scripts. Using `iex` to execute downloaded code without proper validation is a red flag for remote execution attacks.\n\nAdditionally, towards the end of the events, there are commands using `New-PSDrive` with UNC paths like `\\\\Target\\\\C$`. This is a common technique for attackers to access remote drives, often part of lateral movement within a network. The repetition of these commands further suggests an ongoing malicious activity, possibly credential dumping or attempting to spread across systems.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: multiple events executing the same suspicious script, known malicious scripts from GitHub, repeated use of PowerShell for potentially harmful tasks, and attempts to access remote drives—this batch definitely stands out as concerning. The consistency and volume make it highly indicative of a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity downloading code from a known malicious repository and attempting to access remote drives.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events involve PowerShell.exe. That's already a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for their malicious activities. I remember hearing that many APTs and other cyber threats leverage PowerShell scripts to execute commands and avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the details, there are several entries where PowerShell is being executed with different command lines. For instance, in one event, the command line includes downloading a script from a GitHub repository. The URL seems suspicious: \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn...\". That's not a site I recognize as legitimate. It might be hosting malicious code.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is accessing files and registry values. These actions could be part of an attempt to gather information or modify system configurations. The file operations include creating and deleting temporary files in the user's AppData directory, which is common for malicious scripts trying to stay under the radar by not leaving permanent traces.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the creation of a named pipe (Pipe Created event). Named pipes are often used for inter-process communication, but in this context, it might be part of a more complex attack chain, such as establishing a command and control channel or executing further malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Image Load events where PowerShell is loading various DLLs. This could indicate that the script is attempting to load modules or components that aren't typically used, potentially for obfuscation or to enable certain functionalities like persistence or lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe fact that multiple events involve the same process (PowerShell.exe) and follow a sequence of actions that seem suspicious together—downloading scripts, file creation\/deletion, registry modifications—strongly suggests malicious intent. It's not just random noise; it's a pattern that aligns with known attack vectors.\n\nMoreover, the presence of specific file paths like \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData...\" indicates targeted activity on a particular user's profile. This could mean the attacker is attempting to establish persistence within the user's environment or gather sensitive information.\n\nPutting it all together, these events don't look like normal system operations. They exhibit characteristics of potential malicious behavior, including downloading scripts from questionable sources, modifying system configurations, and attempting to hide traces. Therefore, this batch should definitely be classified as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe executing suspicious commands, including downloading a script from a potentially malicious GitHub repository, creating and deleting temporary files, accessing registry values, and loading various DLLs. These activities indicate possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what they indicate.\n\nThe first event shows svchost.exe setting a registry value. That's normal because svchost is part of Windows services and often interacts with the registry. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nNext, sppsvc.exe creates a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\spp\\store\\2.0\\cache\\cache.dat. I know sppsvc is related to software protection, so creating cache files there seems legitimate.\n\nThen there are multiple events from powershell.exe. The first one just accesses the process, which isn't unusual on its own. But later, powershell is run with a specific command line: \"& {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\". Breaking that down, it's trying to create a new PSDrive named 'g' pointing to \\Target\\C$. That looks like an attempt to access another system via remote path. This could be a sign of lateral movement in a network.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe accessing the process again, which might just be part of normal script execution but combined with other actions raises flags.\n\nThere's also a file creation by powershell in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1. The name is random-looking, which is common for malicious scripts to avoid detection. Then, the script is deleted shortly after. Deleting files quickly can be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nMultiple ImageLoad events from powershell loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll are normal as part of PowerShell's operation. However, the frequency might indicate something more if these aren't standard for this user's environment.\n\nAnother event shows a FileDeleteDetected for that same script file, which again suggests an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nLastly, there's a Pipe Created event from powershell.exe, which can be used for communication between processes but is often used in malware for command and control or to hide activities.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of powershell with specific commands targeting remote drives, the creation and deletion of temporary script files, and unusual process access patterns are red flags. These actions don't seem typical for normal user activity and could indicate malicious behavior such as persistence, data exfiltration, or lateral movement within a network.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as interesting due to these suspicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe with potentially malicious activities such as creating remote drives and deleting temporary files, indicative of possible lateral movement or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
