{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at multiple events here. Most of them involve svchost.exe making changes to the registry and creating files in various system directories.\n\nHmm, svchost.exe is a common process that's part of Windows services, so it's not inherently malicious. But seeing a lot of Registry value sets could be suspicious because attackers often modify the registry to maintain persistence or change system configurations.\n\nLooking at the file paths created by svchost.exe: there are entries like 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\Logs\\\\waasmedic\\\\...' and 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\SoftwareDistribution\\\\...'. These look like legitimate Windows directories, so maybe it's normal for svchost.exe to create files here. \n\nHowever, I notice some file names like 'edbtmp.log' and specific hashes in the paths, which might indicate something unusual, but without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious. The high number of similar events could suggest automated or repeated actions, possibly part of a script or update process.\n\nI'm also considering that svchost.exe is often used by legitimate services and can sometimes be involved in attacks. The combination of registry modifications and file creation across different system folders makes me cautious but not certain. \n\nSince the majority of these events are within standard Windows processes, I'm leaning towards them being normal activity. But the volume and specific file operations could warrant closer monitoring.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate system processes (svchost.exe) performing common tasks like registry modifications and file creation in standard Windows directories, which are typical for system updates or maintenance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from svchost.exe creating files under C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install. Svchost is a common process that can be malicious, but in this case, it's creating an executable file named AM_Delta_Patch with specific version numbers. That seems suspicious because patching operations usually don't involve creating new executables like this.\n\nNext, I see MpSigStub.exe which is related to Windows Defender. It's loading MpClient.dll and creating several files in the Temp directory. The filenames look like they're part of an update process, but the naming is odd with GUIDs and version numbers. This could be normal for antivirus updates, but the specific paths and filenames might indicate something unusual.\n\nThen there are multiple setup.exe entries installing various .exe files under the EdgeCore folder. While legitimate software installations can create files, the number of different files created by setup.exe in quick succession raises a red flag. It's possible that this is part of an update or a legitimate process, but it's worth investigating if these files are indeed necessary.\n\nThe RuntimeBroker.exe and powershell.exe events show registry access and process access respectively. Powershell is often used for scripting and can be malicious, so any event involving it without clear justification could be concerning.\n\nPutting all this together, there are several indicators that might point to malicious activity: svchost creating an executable, multiple files created by setup.exe with unusual names, MpSigStub's activities in Temp, and powershell being accessed. However, some of these could also be part of legitimate updates or processes. The volume and specific file paths make the batch interesting enough for further investigation.\n\nSo I'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because there are multiple points that need to be looked into, even though they might not all be malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving svchost.exe creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory and MpSigStub.exe creating several files in the Temp directory with unusual names suggest potential malicious activity. Additionally, powershell.exe accessing processes could indicate command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nLooking at the first few events, there are multiple instances of different processes modifying registry values. For example, RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, and svchost.exe all have entries where a registry value was set. That's a bit concerning because changes to the registry can be part of malicious activities, like installing persistent malware.\n\nThen I see some file creation events. Svchost.exe is creating several files in the Windows SoftwareDistribution Download directory. The paths look legitimate at first glance, but creating multiple files might indicate something unusual, especially if they're part of a large batch of changes. Also, svchost.exe is known to be a legitimate process, but it's often used by malware because it runs with system-level privileges.\n\nThere are also Image Load events from various processes loading urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll. These are standard DLLs used by Windows for handling URLs and BITS services, so that doesn't seem suspicious on its own. However, if these are being loaded by unexpected processes or in large numbers, it could be a red flag.\n\nAnother point is the PowerShell.exe process creating a file in the user's AppData directory. While PowerShell can do legitimate things, it's often targeted by attackers for execution of malicious scripts. The path mentioned seems related to PowerShell's startup profile, which might indicate configuration changes or attempts to maintain persistence.\n\nLooking at the combination of these events: multiple processes modifying registry values and creating files in system directories could be indicative of a malware installation or an attack attempting to persist across reboots. The volume of file creation events from svchost.exe stands out, as does the PowerShell activity, which together might suggest a coordinated malicious effort.\n\nI'm not seeing any clear signs of overtly malicious activities like process injection or network communication, but the pattern of behavior—multiple registry writes and file creations across different processes—is concerning. It's possible that these events are part of a legitimate update or system process, but given the variety of processes involved and the specific actions taken, it raises enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n\nSo, I think this batch is interesting because while individually some events might be normal, together they show signs that could indicate malicious activity. My confidence isn't super high (maybe around 0.6), but there are enough points of concern to merit looking into it more.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes modifying registry values and creating files, including PowerShell activity, may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows that 'powershell.exe' accessed something. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by both admins and attackers, so I'm noting this but not sure yet if it's bad.\n\nNext, 'whoami.exe' was created. That seems normal because it's a standard system command used to get user information. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are more powershell.exe accesses. Still, nothing unusual beyond repeated use of PowerShell.\n\nThe fifth event is interesting. There's a Process Create for powershell.exe with a complex command line. The script path has some odd directory names like 'registro_logico' and 'registro_secundario', which don't seem standard. Also, the script is being executed with a try-catch block and exits on error. That might be obfuscating something or trying to handle exceptions, which could be signs of malicious activity.\n\nAfter that, there are more process accesses by powershell.exe, but then it starts loading various images (ImageLoad events). These include .NET frameworks and Windows system files, which is normal for PowerShell scripts since they often load these libraries. However, the specific paths look legitimate at first glance.\n\nHowever, one of the ImageLoad events points to 'C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender...', which seems a bit odd because I'm not sure why a script would need that particular DLL unless it's trying to hide or use some defender-related functionality in an unusual way.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate event for a temporary file: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1'. Temporary files created by scripts can be normal, but the fact that this file is deleted immediately with a FileDeleteDetected event raises a red flag. Deleting a file right after creating it could indicate an attempt to avoid detection or clean up evidence.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event by powershell.exe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, which can be part of legitimate scripting but also sometimes used in malicious activities for command and control.\n\nContinuing on, more ImageLoad events with various DLLs. These seem normal unless they're loading something from an unexpected location. The paths here look like standard system directories, so probably not a problem.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate by svchost.exe pointing to 'C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\DataStore\\Logs\\edbtmp.log'. Svchost is a common service host process, and creating log files in that directory isn't unusual. I don't see any immediate red flags here.\n\nFinally, another Registry value set event from svchost.exe. Again, services often interact with the registry, so this doesn't stand out as suspicious by itself.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of powershell.exe, especially with a complex command line, the creation and deletion of temporary script files, and the loading of various DLLs might indicate that something malicious is happening. The attempt to delete evidence quickly could be trying to cover tracks. However, some events are normal, like using whoami or loading system libraries.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because of the combination of powershell.exe usage with potentially malicious scripting behavior and file deletions that try to hide activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes accessing files, loading images, and creating\/deleting temporary scripts, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's an event where \"whoami.exe\" is executed. That's usually a legitimate tool used to find out user information, but sometimes attackers might use it to gather system details. Not sure yet, but I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, I notice multiple entries related to powershell.exe. PowerShell can be used for both good and bad things. The fact that it's being accessed (ProcessAccess), creating files (FileCreate), and deleting them (FileDeleteDetected) could indicate script execution. Also, the command line shows a service creation attempt with \"New-Service\". That seems suspicious because attackers often create malicious services to persist on a system.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, loading various DLLs which is normal, but combined with other actions, it might suggest something more. There's also an attempt to load MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which might be part of legitimate operations, but could also be a way to bypass detection if those files are being loaded by malicious code.\n\nThen there are five Registry value set events from services.exe. Services.exe is responsible for the Service Control Manager, so setting registry values here might be an attempt to modify service configurations or add new ones, which can be a red flag for persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: whoami is run, powershell runs scripts that create and delete temporary files, tries to set up a service, loads various DLLs, and services.exe modifies the registry multiple times. These actions seem like they could be part of an attack chain where an attacker is trying to establish persistence by creating a new service, possibly using a script to do so. The deletion of the temp file might be an attempt to clean up traces.\n\nSo overall, this batch shows signs of potentially malicious activity involving PowerShell and registry modifications, which are common in attacks for lateral movement or persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch indicates suspicious activity including PowerShell execution attempting service creation, file operations, and multiple registry modifications, suggesting potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events and trying to figure out if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several events from \"tarefa_logico.exe\" where the task is Image loaded, and they're loading various DLL files related to .NET framework components like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These look like normal operations when an application initializes, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, there are events involving powershell.exe. One event shows that a file was created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This is common for scripts that run during startup but might be worth noting depending on context.\n\nThen, there's a registry value set by powershell.exe. Without knowing what exactly was changed, this could be normal administration or part of script execution. But again, not obviously malicious yet.\n\nA lot of the events after that have \"None\" for process and winlog, except for some where the task is Execute a Remote Command on a specific file path: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. This script is being executed multiple times. The command line in these events shows powershell.exe invoking a script from that path with some parameters and error handling.\n\nFinally, there are several more events where the task alternates between Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle, all pointing to the same script location. These could be part of normal PowerShell operations but repeated executions might indicate something is being run in a loop or as part of an automated process.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch starts with normal processes loading libraries, then powershell.exe activity which includes file creation and registry changes. The latter events show multiple attempts to execute a remote command on a specific script, and repeated calls using powershell.exe with the same script path. This could indicate that someone is trying to run this script either for legitimate purposes or potentially malicious ones.\n\nThe volume of similar events (sixteen in total) might be concerning because it's unusual to have so many entries unless it's part of a known process or an attack vector. The script path and the use of 'Invoke-entrada_principal' could be custom commands, which without context might pose a risk. Therefore, this batch is likely worth investigating further for possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe executing a script from an unusual path with remote command execution and error handling.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at these JSONL entries. Each line has a process, winlog, and file field.\n\nFirst, most of the events have \"winlog\" tasks like \"Execute a Remote Command.\" That's repeated a lot—19 times! Plus, several are from \"services.exe\" with logon tasks. The files being accessed are all pointing to the same path: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1.\n\nHmm, so why would someone execute a remote command multiple times on the same file? That seems suspicious. Maybe it's an attempt at persistence or lateral movement in a network. The repeated access to the same script could be part of malicious activity, like dropping a payload or executing commands as part of an attack.\n\nThe presence of \"services.exe\" logon events might indicate something related to service creation or modification. Services are often used for persistence, so that adds another layer to this batch being potentially malicious.\n\nI'm not seeing any normal user activities here. The repeated remote command execution and the specific file path don't seem like typical behavior. So, I think this batch is definitely interesting for investigation because it shows signs of possible unauthorized access or attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repetitive 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks targeting the same file path, which may indicate potential malicious activity such as script execution or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're worth investigating. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each event has three main components: process, winlog, and file.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple events where PowerShell is being executed with specific command lines. The commands involve importing a PowerShell script from a path like \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\" and then invoking a function called Invoke-entrada_principal. This seems suspicious because it's using PowerShell, which is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities.\n\nThen, there are several events where the command line is creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\". The binary path points to an executable file in a specific directory. Creating services can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware. Repeated attempts to create or start such services might indicate an attempt to establish long-term access.\n\nAnother point of interest is the 'task' field in the winlog entries. Tasks like 'Engine Lifecycle', 'Provider Lifecycle', and 'Execute a Remote Command' could be red flags. 'Execute a Remote Command' especially stands out because it suggests that something is being executed remotely, which can be a sign of remote access or command-and-control activities.\n\nI also see that in some events, the process field is None, but the file path points to the same PowerShell script mentioned earlier. This might indicate that the script is being executed directly or via another method, not necessarily through a visible process.\n\nThe repetition of these actions—multiple attempts to create services and execute scripts—is concerning. Malware often tries multiple methods or repeats actions to ensure persistence or avoid detection. The use of specific file paths like \"C:\\unidade_logico\" might be an attempt to access or modify system-level components, which could indicate privilege escalation or system compromise.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of repeated PowerShell commands, service creation attempts, and remote command execution tasks raises red flags. These activities don't seem to be part of normal system operations. They could be indicative of a cyberattack, such as installing malware, creating backdoors, or establishing persistence on the system.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it exhibits behavior that's uncommon and potentially malicious. My confidence in this classification is high because the repeated patterns and specific command-line activities are strong indicators of possible malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands attempt to create services and execute scripts, possibly indicating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. There are 19 events in total, and each one is in JSONL format. Let me start by understanding what each event represents.\n\nMost of the events seem to have three fields: process, winlog, and file. The first few events all show \"process\" as None, which probably means there's no associated process information. The \"winlog\" field has a task attribute; for example, one is 'Execute a Remote Command' and another is 'Windows Update Agent'. The \"file\" field sometimes has a path pointing to a specific .ps1 script file.\n\nI notice that the majority of these events (from event 1 to 14) all have the same structure: process is None, winlog task is 'Execute a Remote Command', and the file path points to C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1. This repetition makes me think it's part of normal operations or possibly some automated script execution.\n\nThen there are a couple of events where the winlog task is different. Event 16 has 'Windows Update Agent', which sounds like it's related to system updates, something legitimate. The file field here is None, so no associated file. Similarly, event 17 also has 'Windows Update Agent' and file as None.\n\nThe last two events (events 18 and 19) again show the same pattern as the first ones: 'Execute a Remote Command' with the specific .ps1 file path. So out of 19 events, only two are different in terms of the task type.\n\nNow, I need to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. The key points here are:\n\n1. **Repetitive Nature**: Most events are identical except for two. Repetition could indicate a script running multiple times or part of a scheduled task. However, it's still worth checking if these are legitimate.\n\n2. **Task Type 'Execute a Remote Command'**: This task usually indicates some form of remote execution, which can be malicious (like command-line attacks) but can also be part of legitimate system management scripts.\n\n3. **File Path Consistency**: The same .ps1 file is referenced multiple times. Powershell scripts are common in both system administration and in malware, so having the same script executed repeatedly might warrant investigation to ensure it's not malicious.\n\n4. **Legitimate Tasks**: Events 16 and 17 relate to Windows Update Agent, which is a standard part of system operations, so no red flags there.\n\nConsidering all this, while the majority of events don't seem immediately suspicious on their own, the repeated execution of the same script could be a sign of malicious activity or it might just be normal. Since I have multiple instances of the same file being executed via remote commands, it's worth investigating to confirm if this is expected behavior for the system.\n\nTherefore, my classification would lean towards \"INTERESTING\" because the repetition and the specific task type raise some concerns that need further scrutiny.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated events indicate potential script execution or automated tasks. The consistency in file paths suggests possible malicious activity or legitimate scheduled tasks, warranting investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
