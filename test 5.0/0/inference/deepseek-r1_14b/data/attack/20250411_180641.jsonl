{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: Chrome.exe loaded an image from MpOAV.dll in the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal because Defender uses such files to scan for malware. But I should check if the file version is up-to-date, as outdated versions might be a red flag.\n\nSecond event: Again, chrome.exe made a registry change. Browsers often do this for settings or extensions, so that's not unusual on its own. However, unexpected registry edits can sometimes indicate malicious activity, but without more context, it's hard to say here.\n\nThird event: Winlogbeat.exe created a file in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool installed by IT for log management. The fact that it's creating a config file seems routine unless permissions are off or the path looks suspicious.\n\nLooking at all events together, there's nothing overtly malicious. They seem like normal operations from legitimate processes. Unless I have more data showing unusual behavior or anomalies across these events, they don't raise any red flags collectively.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activities involving common processes and standard log entries.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections. That's normal because Chrome handles a lot of network activities. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nNext, there are several powershell.exe instances. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be malicious. The events show 'Process accessed' and some registry activity. Registry changes could indicate configuration or persistence mechanisms, which might be suspicious.\n\nThen, cmd.exe appears with a command line that involves compiling C# code into an executable using csc.exe. Compiling from the command line isn't unusual, but it's often seen in malware to create malicious binaries on the fly. The output paths are pointing to temporary files, which can be a red flag because attackers might use temp folders for staging.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where processes like cmd.exe and csc.exe create new executables in temp directories. These include names like 'tarefa_temporario.exe' and others, which don't seem descriptive of legitimate activities. The creation of these files could be part of a script or malware dropping payloads.\n\nThe events also show several ImageLoad tasks for various modules, some with paths that look normal but others that point to temporary files. Malware often loads components from unexpected locations. Additionally, there's a Process Create event for 'modulo_secundario.exe' loading mscoree.dll, which is legitimate, but the context here seems suspicious given other activities.\n\nThe presence of multiple process creations and file operations in temp directories, combined with powershell.exe accessing registry keys, makes me think this could be part of a larger script or attack chain. These actions are often used in ransomware, backdooring, or other malicious activities.\n\nI'm also noticing the repetitive nature of certain processes, like cmd.exe being called multiple times with similar command lines. This repetition might indicate an automated script running, which is more concerning if it's doing so many things that could be malicious.\n\nTaking all these points together, the batch shows signs of potentially malicious activity. The combination of powershell.exe, cmd.exe executing code to create executables in temp folders, and registry modifications stands out as behavior that could indicate an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creations, network connections, and file operations in temporary directories suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event involves tarefa_base.exe loading clrjit.dll. That's a known legitimate process related to .NET framework, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext is elemento_ativo.exe terminating. Processes sometimes terminate normally; without more context, this doesn't raise red flags.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of cmd.exe, conhost.exe, notepad.exe, and powershell.exe accessing the registry or other processes. These are common system utilities that often perform such actions, so no immediate concern.\n\nI notice several calc.exe events loading urlmon.dll. That's a standard DLL for URL handling, which is normal in many applications, including Calculator if it needs to handle URLs or update checks.\n\nSVCHOST.EXE appears multiple times with registry changes. Since svchost.exe is part of Windows services and often runs legitimate tasks, this isn't unusual unless there are other indicators.\n\nThere's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an Elasticsearch log shipping tool; if it's running as intended, this is normal activity.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying the registry is typical for UI-related processes in Windows.\n\nMultiple powershell.exe entries accessing the registry and other processes. PowerShell can be used maliciously, but isolated events don't necessarily indicate abuse. The presence of winlogbeat suggests monitoring tools might be involved, which could explain some of these actions.\n\nThe chrome.exe logs show several registry accesses and loading amsi.dll. Chrome is a browser that often interacts with system components. Loading amsi (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) DLL is standard for applications needing to integrate with Windows' antivirus features.\n\nLooking at the overall batch, most events are typical system processes handling normal operations. There's a pattern of registry activity from various legitimate processes and tools like winlogbeat. Without signs of unusual process behavior, file accesses to malicious paths, or anomalies in timestamps or frequencies, there's no strong indication of malicious activity.\n\nHowever, the concentration on Registry value sets across multiple processes might warrant closer examination. But considering the prevalence of such events in a monitored environment with tools like winlogbeat, it could be part of legitimate monitoring activities rather than malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists primarily of normal system processes and registry activities typical of legitimate software operations. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or anomalies that would require investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
