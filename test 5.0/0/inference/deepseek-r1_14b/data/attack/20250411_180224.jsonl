{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. \n\nLooking at the first few entries, I see powershell.exe and cmd.exe being used with commands that create scheduled tasks. The command lines are trying to execute PowerShell scripts, but the file paths mentioned don't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1). That's a red flag because attackers often use non-existent files to bypass detection or leave fewer traces.\n\nThen there's schtasks.exe creating daily tasks and accessing system32 files like taskschd.dll. This could be part of persistence mechanisms since scheduled tasks can run malicious code at intervals. The repeated Registry value sets from cmd.exe, svchost.exe, and chrome.exe are also suspicious because legitimate apps usually don't modify the registry that way.\n\nI notice multiple instances where svchost.exe writes to the registry and creates files. Svchost is often used by malware to hide processes. Plus, there's a file creation event for .winlogbeat.yml.new which might be unrelated, but combined with other events, it adds up.\n\nThe high number of RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe stands out. Chrome doesn't typically log so many registry writes unless something is amiss. It could indicate tampering or malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these together—suspicious process creations, non-existent scripts, registry modifications, and file operations—it seems like a coordinated attack. The events show signs of persistence, lateral movement, and potential data exfiltration or system compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities such as the creation of scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe, execution of PowerShell scripts with bypass restrictions, and repeated registry modifications. These activities suggest potential malicious behavior indicative of an attack or compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this JSONL batch to analyze. Let me take a look at each event and see if there's anything interesting here.\n\nThe first line has \"process\" as winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory with .winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because Winlogbeat is an agent that collects logs, so it's likely just setting up or updating its configuration file.\n\nNext, powershell.exe creates a file named entrada_ativo.txt in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be malicious. Creating a new text file isn't suspicious on its own, but I should keep an eye out for other activities related to it.\n\nThen there are two events where powershell.exe accesses processes. This could mean it's running some commands or scripts. If these are part of normal operations, that's fine, but if they're accessing things like system32 or running malicious scripts, that could be a red flag. However, without more context on what exactly is being accessed, it's hard to say.\n\nThe fourth event shows whoami.exe being executed with the command line pointing to the system32 directory. Whoami is typically used to display user information and isn't inherently malicious. But sometimes attackers use it to gather info before an attack, so I should note that but not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nLooking at all events together: powershell.exe running multiple times, creating a file, accessing processes, and whoami.exe being called. This combination could be concerning because PowerShell is often used in attacks, especially when combined with process access and the creation of files. It's possible an attacker is trying to execute commands or move laterally within the system.\n\nBut I don't have enough information about what exactly these processes are doing. For example, if the powershell.exe events are part of legitimate administration tasks, then it might not be suspicious. However, considering the context that these logs were provided for analysis and the fact that there are multiple actions from different processes (winlogbeat, powershell, whoami), it's safer to consider this batch as interesting.\n\nSo my classification would be INTERESTING because of the potential misuse of PowerShell and process access activities, even though each event alone might not raise a flag. The combination is what makes me cautious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events from powershell.exe accessing processes and creating files, along with the execution of whoami.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
