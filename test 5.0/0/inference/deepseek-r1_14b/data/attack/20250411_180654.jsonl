{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The goal is to determine if the entire set is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe being executed with different command lines. Each command line points to a different path but they all reference Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts and output logs to the TEMP directory. This seems suspicious because such scripts are often used for keylogging or other malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, I see that some events show file creations and deletions related to PowerShell script policy tests. The fact that these temporary files are being created and then deleted might indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies or to erase evidence after execution.\n\nThere's also an event where a remote command is executed via conhost.exe, which could be another red flag as it's commonly used for executing malicious scripts without being detected easily.\n\nWhile there are normal activities like file creation by winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe, these don't outweigh the concerning patterns observed with powershell.exe and the associated script executions.\n\nGiven that multiple instances of potentially malicious PowerShell commands are present, along with attempts to manage temporary files, it's reasonable to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which may indicate keylogging or malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user mentioned these are system logs from JSONL files, so each line is a separate event. \n\nFirst, I notice several entries where 'powershell.exe' is involved. PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, but the command lines here catch my eye. Specifically, there are command lines that execute scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script name sounds suspiciousâ€”it might be designed to capture keystrokes, which is a common tactic in malware for keylogging.\n\nLooking at the events, 'powershell.exe' is accessing files and registry values, and also loading various .NET assemblies. The repeated use of 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' tasks could indicate some form of persistence or privilege escalation. Also, multiple instances where powershell runs scripts suggest automated behavior, possibly trying to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the occurrence of 'whoami.exe'. While this is a legitimate command used to get user information, its presence alongside other suspicious activities might be part of a larger attack chain, like credential dumping or lateral movement.\n\nThe events involving 'chrome.exe' modifying registry values are also notable. Malware often uses registry modifications for persistence, so it's worth monitoring how many times this happens. If these changes aren't part of normal Chrome operation, they could be indicators of malicious activity.\n\nOverall, the combination of PowerShell executing scripts from unexpected paths, multiple process creations, and registry modifications points towards potential malicious behavior. The repeated patterns and suspicious script names make me lean towards classifying this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts, including command-line arguments that reference keylogging activities. Additionally, there are repeated registry modifications and process creations that may indicate suspicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of three JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and then consider them together.\n\nFirst event: Process is svchost.exe creating a file at C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\State\\keyValueLKG.dat. Svchost is known for being a legitimate process but can be used maliciously since it's part of the Windows services and often obfuscated. The path seems deep into system files, which could be normal or suspicious.\n\nSecond event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is likely an ELK Stack tool for log management. The file name ends with .new, suggesting it might be a configuration file being updated. This doesn't immediately raise red flags since it's about logging and monitoring.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe creating a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_padrao.txt. PowerShell is powerful but often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. The filename is in Portuguese, which might indicate it's user-generated or part of legitimate operations if the system uses that language.\n\nLooking at them together, all three involve file creation. Svchost is a red flag because it can be malicious. However, without more context like timestamps or other events (like process creation anomalies), it's hard to say definitively. Winlogbeat and PowerShell could be benign but also potentially malicious if used inappropriately.\n\nI'm leaning towards INTERESTING because svchost.exe activity often warrants closer look, especially when creating files in non-standard locations. However, without additional data, the confidence isn't very high.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes file creation events by processes like svchost.exe and powershell.exe, which could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
