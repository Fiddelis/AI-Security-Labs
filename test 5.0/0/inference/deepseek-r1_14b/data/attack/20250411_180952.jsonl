{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at four JSONL entries here. Each event has a process, a winlog task, and sometimes a file path.\n\nFirst event: svchost.exe created a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\sru\\SRUtmp.log. Svchost is a common system process, often used by legitimate services, but sometimes malware can hide under it. But creating a log file isn't unusual; maybe it's part of normal operations.\n\nSecond event: winlogbeat.exe created a new config file in the user's downloads folder. Winlogbeat is an ELK tool for collecting logs, so this looks benign. It's probably setting up its configuration during installation or update.\n\nThird and fourth events: powershell.exe accessing registry and process. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both for good and bad purposes. Accessing the registry to set values could be part of legitimate admin tasks, but it's also common in attacks because of its scripting capabilities. The fact that there are two events from powershell—setting a registry value and accessing a process—raises an eyebrow. This could indicate someone is trying to modify system settings or perhaps lateral movement.\n\nPutting them all together: While the first two seem normal, the powershell activities might be concerning. They don't definitively show malicious activity, but they're more notable than the others. So overall, this batch isn't super alarming, but it's worth a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes events involving powershell.exe accessing registry and process information, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. I'm going through each event one by one and looking for patterns or signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst off, I see multiple events from processes like chrome.exe making network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser that typically does these things when browsing the web. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are several entries from powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, so I need to look closer. The process access events might indicate scripting or remote commands being executed. The registry changes could be part of configuration but might also hint at persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe command that adds a new user \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with the password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and adds them to the Domain Admins group. That's concerning because creating a new domain admin account, especially with a weak password like \" registro_temporario_pass123!\", could be an indicator of privilege escalation. This is definitely something to look into.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command uses net.exe and net1.exe to add users and groups. The use of these commands with similar usernames and passwords, such as \"modulo_comum_Admin\" and \"unidade_comum_Admin\", suggests a pattern. These could be attempts to create multiple admin accounts, which is often seen in attacks aiming for persistence or lateral movement within the network.\n\nLooking at the file creation events: winlogbeat.exe creating a config file isn't unusual if it's part of log management setup. However, powershell.exe creating \"pacote_base.txt\" might be writing some configuration or dropping malicious scripts, which could be suspicious. The svchost.exe creating files in the sru directory is a bit odd since svchost is typically a legitimate process, but writing to that path could indicate something's wrong.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of user creation with weak passwords via cmd and net commands are red flags. These activities align with common attack tactics like credential dumping, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. The repeated use of similar commands across different processes suggests a coordinated attack rather than normal administrative tasks. While some events alone might not be alarming, the combination points to potential malicious behavior that requires investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including user creation with weak passwords, repeated registry modifications, and network connections indicate possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
