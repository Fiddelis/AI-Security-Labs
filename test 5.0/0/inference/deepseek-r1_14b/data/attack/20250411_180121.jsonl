Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format with each line being a JSON object containing process info, windows log tasks, and file details.\n\nLooking at the first few entries: there are multiple instances where 'chrome.exe' is involved, specifically network connections and DNS queries. This seems normal since Chrome handles web traffic regularly, so these events alone might not be suspicious.\n\nHowever, I notice that after a few Chrome events, there's a shift to 'powershell.exe'. The command line in one of the PowerShell entries stands out: it uses powershell.exe to download files from GitHub URLs into temporary directories. This is concerning because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities.\n\nThe file operations include creating and then deleting a PS1 script in the Temp directory, which suggests an attempt to execute arbitrary code or payload delivery. Additionally, multiple DownloadFile calls are present, each fetching files from different GitHub repositories into the same temporary folder. These actions could be part of a larger script or malicious payload deployment.\n\nThe events also show several registry changes and image loads by PowerShell, which can indicate attempts to persist malware or gain system privileges. The repeated downloading from raw.githubusercontent.com might be trying to retrieve components of a larger toolset, possibly for lateral movement or further attacks within the network.\n\nConsidering all these together—suspicious PowerShell activities like script downloads, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and repeated network accesses—it's clear that this batch indicates potential malicious behavior. The confidence level is high because multiple indicators point towards possible exploitation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activities including downloading files from GitHub repositories into temporary directories, creating and deleting a PS1 script in the Temp folder, and repeated network connections.

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being accessed and creating processes. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated access could be a red flag. The command lines vary, but some seem empty or just reference the executable without clear commands, which might indicate obfuscation or standard usage.\n\nI also notice several events where registry values are being set or deleted using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`. These actions alone aren't necessarily suspicious unless they're part of a larger pattern. The specific registry paths mentioned, like modifying Run keys (`HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`), could be used by malware to persist between reboots.\n\nThere are events where `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` were created or accessed. These tools can be legitimate for user identification but might also be part of an attacker's toolkit to gather system information or elevate privileges.\n\nAnother point is the repeated occurrence of `powershell.exe` with empty command lines, which could mean they're being called without any specific commands, perhaps as a way to check if the process creation is monitored. This behavior can sometimes be used in attacks to evade detection by leaving minimal traces.\n\nThe last event involves loading `mscoree.dll`, which is related to .NET and might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with other PowerShell activities, it could hint at executing malicious scripts or payload execution.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple instances of process creations for tools like PowerShell and cmd.exe, registry modifications that could enable persistence, and potential obfuscation techniques. These signs collectively suggest possible malicious activity, making the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe accessing registry values, potential indication of malicious activities such as persistence or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial few entries show powershell.exe being used with command lines that download files from GitHub repositories. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files in various branches, but it's suspicious because PowerShell is often used maliciously. The file paths are saved to the TEMP directory, which is a common spot for temporary files, sometimes used by malware.\n\nThen, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is involved without command lines. Some of these mention tasks like 'Pipe Created' and 'File created', which might be normal, but combined with previous downloads, it raises flags.\n\nNext, several entries from chrome.exe show registry value sets. While Chrome can modify the registry for settings, doing this multiple times in a row could indicate something unusual, especially if it's not related to user activity.\n\nThere are also events where conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe are involved. Conhost is a Windows component, so its presence alone isn't suspicious, but combined with other activities, it might be worth noting. Winlogbeat is likely part of log management, but the file path seems normal unless there's more context.\n\nI notice that many events don't have associated files or processes, which makes it harder to assess intent. However, the repeated downloading of files using powershell.exe and subsequent file creations in TEMP directories could be signs of malicious activity like dropping payloads or scripts.\n\nThe tasks under winlog vary between 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Engine Lifecycle', 'Pipe Created', and more. These could be normal operations, but when paired with external file downloads, they might indicate an attack vector.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are several red flags: multiple PowerShell downloads from various GitHub repos, repeated file creations in TEMP, and multiple registry modifications. While some events might be benign, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior that merits investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes downloading files from external sources and creating temporary files, along with unusual file creation and registry activity, indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of PowerShell.exe processes. That's a red flag because attackers often use it for command execution and lateral movement. Then there are events where files are being created, especially in user directories like Downloads. For example, 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_base.txt' might be suspicious—it sounds like an unusual file name.\n\nLooking at the network connections, MpDefenderCoreService.exe detected one. That's a legitimate process, but I should check if it was an unexpected connection. Next, winlogbeat.exe creating files in its own directory seems normal for log shipping tools.\n\nThere are several Registry value sets and accesses by PowerShell.exe and other processes. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware.\n\nI notice some commands executed via cmd.exe, like SCHTASKS to delete a task named 'spawn'. Scheduling tasks is common in attack chains for persistence, so deleting them might be an attempt to cover tracks or remove backdoors.\n\nAlso, there are ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll and taskschd.dll. While these are legitimate system files, their use by certain processes could indicate malicious activity. For example, if a suspicious process loads urlmon, it might be trying to establish communication channels.\n\nThe event where whoami.exe is run without arguments isn't too concerning on its own, but when combined with other activities, it adds context about user impersonation or information gathering.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated use of schtasks.exe and cmd.exe with specific commands. Attackers often use task scheduling to maintain persistence, so deleting tasks could mean they're trying to remove evidence or stop monitoring.\n\nIn summary, while some events are normal, the combination of PowerShell activity, registry modifications, file creation in user directories, and command-line activities like SCHTASKS deletion raises concern about potential malicious behavior. This batch seems relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell executions, registry modifications, file creations, and command-line operations indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe with tasks related to Image Load. These are just PowerShell loading various DLLs, which is normal. Then there's a file creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script. That could be suspicious because creating and then deleting a script might indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are events where cmd.exe is involved, particularly running with the \/c command. This often means executing a single command and exiting. If cmd is being used without arguments, it's not unusual, but sometimes attackers use it to run other tools or scripts.\n\nThere's also an instance where whoami.exe was executed. That tool is commonly used to check user permissions and might be part of legitimate activity, but in some cases, it can be used by attackers to gather information.\n\nAnother point is the file creation event for winlogbeat.yml.new, which seems related to log management. Since I'm seeing events from winlogbeat.exe, this might just be the tool collecting logs, so that's probably normal.\n\nI also see several Registry value sets and Process accesses involving both PowerShell and cmd.exe. While these could be part of legitimate operations, they can also be signs of malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple PowerShell instances loading DLLs, creating\/deleting a temp script, using cmd.exe with \/c, running whoami, and registry modifications. These activities don't conclusively indicate malicious behavior but do raise some red flags. The combination could be part of normal admin tasks or something more nefarious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the actions, while not entirely malicious, show behaviors that might warrant closer inspection. However, without additional context, it's hard to say for sure. My confidence is around 0.7 because there are red flags but no clear signs of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell loading various DLLs and file operations, including creation and deletion of a temporary script file, which may indicate potential malicious activity or attempts to hide scripts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one to see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nThe first event is cmd.exe setting a registry value. That's normal admin activity or script usage, not unusual.\n\nNext is conhost.exe doing the same with the registry. Conhost is often used in command-line tools, so this seems routine.\n\nThen there are multiple powershell.exe entries. PowerShell is commonly misused by attackers, but it's also widely used for legitimate tasks. I need to look at what each event shows about PowerShell.\n\nLooking at the first PowerShell event: Process accessed and then Process Create. The command line has \"& {}\" which isn't typical, might be a way to hide commands or inject code. That could be red flag.\n\nAnother process create event with \"& {}\". This repetition makes me think it's part of a script or malicious activity trying to stay under the radar.\n\nThere are several RegistryEvent tasks for PowerShell. Modifying registry settings in scripts can be normal but also used by malware for persistence or configuration changes.\n\nMultiple ImageLoad events loading various DLLs like mscoree, clrjit, etc. These are legitimate .NET components, so not suspicious on their own unless they're being loaded in an unusual way.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate event for a PowerShell script in the Temp folder: __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. Temporary scripts can be part of testing or malicious activity. The fact that it was created and then deleted quickly might indicate an attempt to remove evidence, which is concerning.\n\nAnother event shows this file being deleted. If a script deletes itself after execution, it could be trying to avoid detection, which raises the suspicion level.\n\nLastly, ApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying the registry. This process is usually related to Windows Store apps and shouldn't be doing such changes unless part of an exploit.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell instances with unusual command lines, script creation and deletion in Temp, repeated RegistryEvent actions. These behaviors suggest potential malicious activity aiming to stay undetected.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe with unusual command lines, including registry modifications and file operations that may indicate suspicious activity such as script injection or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm supposed to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. So first, I'll go through each event one by one.\n\nLooking at the events, a lot of them are from powershell.exe. That makes me think because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first few events show that powershell.exe is loading various .NET framework DLLs. That could be normal if someone is running scripts or using .NET features in their code.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created: __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1 in the user's temp directory. Creating temporary files isn't unusual, but it depends on what's happening next. The next event deletes that same file immediately. So powershell.exe creates and then deletes this script file within a short time frame. That might be a red flag because creating and deleting files quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is trying to remove items from the TEMP directory using Remove-Item commands with different zip files. Each command is removing a specific .zip file, which suggests that these files might have been created earlier. The fact that they're being deleted and the use of ErrorAction Ignore means the script doesn't stop if it fails, which could indicate a cleanup attempt.\n\nThe last few events are from chrome.exe loading some DLLs and setting registry values, but those seem less concerning compared to the PowerShell activities. They might just be normal browser operations.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple calls to delete files in the TEMP directory from powershell.exe, along with quick file creation\/deletion of a script, could indicate that an attacker is trying to clean up evidence or remove malicious files after execution. This behavior isn't typical for legitimate use and raises suspicion.

Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware.\n\nSome events show file creation activities by PowerShell, especially creating .txt files in different locations.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a batch of system log events in JSONL format and wants me to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. They specified that I should analyze all events collectively and return only one classification, justification, and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each event to understand what's happening. I'll start by listing out each event:\n\n1. Calculator.exe setting a registry value.\n2. powershell.exe creating a pipe.\n3. Another instance of powershell.exe setting a registry value.\n4. powershell.exe accessing another process.\n5. chrome.exe creating a pipe.\n6. chrome.exe setting a registry value multiple times (7-12 events).\n7. Two instances where powershell.exe is called with \"& {}\" as command line arguments, and the task is \"Engine Lifecycle.\"\n8. A powershell.exe event loading MpClient.dll via ImageLoad rule.\n9. powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory.\n10. conhost.exe setting a registry value.\n11. whoami.exe being executed non-interactively.\n12. Another powershell.exe accessing a process, and then creating itself with specific command line arguments to remove a file from TEMP.\n13. More powershell.exe events accessing processes and setting registry values.\n14. powershell.exe loading mscoree.dll.\n\nNow, I need to analyze these collectively. Let's see:\n\n- The batch has multiple events involving powershell.exe, which is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Powershell can execute commands, create files, access the registry, load images, etc.\n- Notably, event 12 shows a command line argument \"& {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This is a powershell script to delete a specific file in the TEMP directory. The use of \"Remove-Item\" and the ErrorAction set to Ignore suggests an attempt to remove a file without user interaction, which could be suspicious.\n- There are multiple registry modifications by various processes, including chrome.exe and Calculator.exe, but more concerning is the pattern of powershell.exe activity.\n- whoami.exe being executed non-interactively might not be malicious on its own, but in combination with other activities, it raises an eyebrow. It's often used to check user identity, which could be part of a reconnaissance phase.\n- The repeated registry writes and file creation by chrome.exe and others might indicate some persistence or data collection mechanisms.\n\nLooking for indicators of compromise (IoCs), the use of powershell.exe in a way that suggests script execution (like event 7's command line) is a red flag. Additionally, attempting to delete files from TEMP without proper context could be part of file deletion techniques used by malware to cover their tracks or remove payloads.\n\nThe high number of events involving powershell.exe and the specific actions like deleting files from TEMP make this batch concerning. While some events might be legitimate, the combination points towards potential malicious activity, especially considering the persistence mechanisms (registry writes) and the use of powershell for execution.\n\nI should also consider if these activities are within normal user behavior. For instance, a user typically wouldn't run multiple registry edits and file deletions through powershell unless they're performing system administration tasks, which is rare in most environments. The non-interactive whoami.exe suggests it's part of an automated process, possibly malicious.\n\nIn conclusion, the batch shows signs of potential malicious activity due to the suspicious use of powershell.exe commands, registry modifications, and file deletions without user interaction.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activities including registry modifications, file creation, and deletion attempts, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first four events are all about powershell.exe being accessed. Powershell is a common tool for admins but also often used in attacks. However, without more context on what it's doing, these alone might not be suspicious. Then there are instances of whoami.exe being executed, which is usually harmless as it just returns user info.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple events where powershell.exe is accessed and some file creations. Notably, one event involves creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file, which seems related to the ELK stack's winlogbeat tool—probably part of log management. Another event creates pacote_ativo.txt, which doesn't immediately ring any bells.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many powershell.exe accesses? That could be normal admin activity or something more nefarious. The repeated use might indicate script execution or lateral movement. Also, the creation of a .txt file named 'pacote_ativo' translates to 'active package' in Portuguese—maybe related to malicious payloads or communication.\n\nConsidering all events together, the combination of multiple powershell accesses and some file creations could be red flags. It's possible that an attacker is using powershell for command execution and creating files for persistence or data exfiltration. The justification would focus on the repeated use of a high-risk tool and unusual file activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and a file creation event involving 'pacote_ativo.txt' may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell activity. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities and can do both good and bad things. So that's a red flag.\n\nLooking at the events:\n\n1. There are several entries where powershell.exe is creating or accessing files and registry values. For example, one event shows File created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory, which might be trying to hide or create persistence mechanisms.\n\n2. I see commands like Remove-Item being executed against files in the TEMP folder. This suggests that something is cleaning up its tracks by deleting temporary files. Deleting files could indicate an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activity, so that's concerning.\n\n3. There are multiple Registry value sets. Attackers often use registry modifications to maintain persistence or change system configurations. Each time a registry event occurs with powershell.exe, it makes me think they're trying to do something stealthy or long-lasting on the system.\n\n4. The process create events for whoami.exe and other executables might be part of lateral movement or information gathering. Using commands like whoami can help determine user privileges or system info, which is useful for attackers to understand the environment.\n\n5. There are several Image Load events from powershell.exe loading various .NET and MS files. While this isn't necessarily malicious on its own, it might be part of a larger script execution that could be doing something harmful in memory.\n\n6. A file was created and then deleted in the TEMP folder with a PowerShell script policy test name. This seems suspicious because creating and immediately deleting a script file might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or delete evidence quickly.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of Powershell scripting doing several things: modifying registry, accessing processes, creating\/deleting files, possibly executing scripts, which could all be signs of malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell.exe across multiple events without any legitimate context makes this batch stand out as potentially malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and suspicious script execution suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
