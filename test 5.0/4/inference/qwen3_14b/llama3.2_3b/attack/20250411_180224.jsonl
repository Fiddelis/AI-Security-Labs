The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the JSON entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: it's a process creation of cmd.exe with a command line that includes schtasks creating a scheduled task. The command line has a PowerShell script being executed with -ep bypass, which is a common technique to bypass execution policies. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\" which might be a red flag because it's named as if it doesn't exist, but maybe it's a typo or a misdirection. However, the fact that schtasks is being used to create a task that runs PowerShell with bypass is concerning.\n\nNext, there's another event with schtasks.exe creating a scheduled task again, this time with a different script path: c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the same pattern of using schtasks to create a daily task under the system account. The use of \"NonExistingScript\" in the filename is suspicious. Also, the task is named \"win32times,\" which doesn't seem like a standard task name. \n\nLooking at the file creation events, there's a file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times. That's the directory where scheduled tasks are stored, so creating a task there is normal, but combined with the previous events, it might be part of a malicious setup.\n\nOther events include registry value sets and process creations, but the main points are the scheduled tasks being created with PowerShell commands that bypass execution policies. The presence of multiple schtasks.exe processes creating tasks with non-existent script names could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code. Also, the use of \"system\" account for the task suggests elevated privileges, which is a red flag.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is normal for checking user context, but combined with the other events, it might be part of the attacker's reconnaissance. The PowerShell process being accessed could be part of the execution chain.\n\nHowever, some of the other events like chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files might be benign. But the key here is the combination of scheduled tasks created with malicious-looking commands. Even though the scripts are named as non-existing, the fact that they're being invoked via schtasks with system privileges is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch includes events that create scheduled tasks with PowerShell commands bypassing execution policies, which is a common tactic in malware. The confidence is high, but maybe not 100% because the script files might not exist, but the attempt itself is suspicious. Therefore, classification is INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show creation of scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe with PowerShell commands bypassing execution policies (-ep bypass), targeting non-existent scripts. This pattern is commonly associated with malicious activity, such as attempting to execute payloads under the system account.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
