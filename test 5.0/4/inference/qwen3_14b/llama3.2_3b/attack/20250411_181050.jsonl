The process is powershell.exe, and the winlog task is \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\". The file is None.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this event is interesting. PowerShell is a common tool used by attackers for executing commands, so its usage can be benign or malicious. The log entry mentions a process access rule, which might be part of normal system operations. However, without more context, like command-line arguments, parent process information, or network activity, it's hard to tell if this is suspicious. \n\nSince there's only one event here, and no additional details, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because a single PowerShell process access without any other anomalies isn't enough to raise a red flag. The confidence would be low, maybe around 0.3. But I should check if the rule \"ProcessAccess\" is part of a known security event. However, without more data, it's safer to say not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Single event showing normal process access by powershell.exe with no additional suspicious indicators\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing a DNS query, powershell.exe accessing a process, whoami.exe running. Those seem normal. But then there's cmd.exe with a command line that uses certutil to encode and decode files. That stands out. Certutil is often used for encoding\/decoding, but when combined with commands like this, it might be part of an attack, like hiding malicious code.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of certutil.exe being used to decode files into temporary directories. The paths mentioned are in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp folder, which is common for malware to store temporary files. Also, the decoded files have names like \"modulo_logico_calc_decoded.exe\" – the use of \"modulo_logico\" (which translates to \"logical module\" in Portuguese) might be obfuscation, but the fact that it's being decoded and executed is suspicious.\n\nThen there's the rundll32.exe executing a command related to PcaSvc.dll. That could be part of a legitimate process, but sometimes used in exploits. Also, SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll – those are system files, but if they're being loaded from unexpected places or in unusual contexts, that could be a red flag.\n\nThe powershell.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder isn't necessarily bad, but combined with the other certutil activities, it might be part of a larger pattern. Also, chrome.exe having multiple registry value sets might indicate some configuration changes, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key points here are the use of certutil for encoding\/decoding, which is often seen in malware to obfuscate payloads. The creation of executable files in temporary directories suggests that something is being executed that wasn't there before. The combination of these events, along with the use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe, could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code or exfiltrate data.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack yet. The events might be part of a benign process, but the pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no clear indicator of compromise, but the activities are suspicious and could be part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files in temp directories, cmd.exe executing obfuscated commands, and PowerShell creating files in Downloads. These patterns are commonly associated with malware distribution or execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
