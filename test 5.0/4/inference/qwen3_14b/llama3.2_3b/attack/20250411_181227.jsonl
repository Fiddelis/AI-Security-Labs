So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple PowerShell commands that are creating scheduled tasks. The command lines show the use of New-ScheduledTaskAction with calc.exe as the executable. That's a red flag because calc.exe is a legitimate calculator, but using it in a scheduled task might be suspicious. The triggers are set to run at logon, and the principal is set to Administrators with high run level. That's a bit concerning because it's giving high privileges to a task that might not need them.\n\nThen there are several entries where PowerShell is loading .NET DLLs like clr.dll, mscoreei.dll, etc. That's normal for PowerShell, but combined with the scheduled tasks, it might indicate some script execution. Also, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute and then clean up traces. The file name has \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" which might be a misleading name to avoid detection.\n\nAnother event shows a registry value set by chrome.exe. Not sure if that's relevant, but the main suspicious stuff is around PowerShell and scheduled tasks. Also, there's an event with \"Execute a Remote Command\" which could be part of a larger attack, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, combined with the scheduled tasks and the file creation\/deletion, it seems like someone is trying to set up persistent access with administrative privileges.\n\nThe confidence here is high because creating multiple scheduled tasks with admin rights, using PowerShell to execute calc.exe (which is a common method to test or execute code), and the temporary file creation\/deletion are all indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some parts are normal (like loading .NET DLLs), the combination of these events points to something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges, using calc.exe as the payload. This pattern, combined with temporary file creation\/deletion and .NET DLL loading, suggests potential malicious activity attempting to establish persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is \"None\" and the winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That's repeated multiple times. Hmm, executing remote commands can be a sign of something malicious, like a hacker trying to control the system. But wait, maybe these are just normal system events? I'm not sure. However, having multiple instances of the same event might indicate a pattern.\n\nThen, there's a process called WmiPrvSE.exe with a file path to taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate Windows process, but the file path is in System32, which is normal. But the task is \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\" â€“ maybe that's okay. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, svchost.exe creating a file in Tasks\\\\unidade_comum. That path seems a bit odd. \"unidade_comum\" might be a Portuguese term, but I'm not sure. svchost.exe is a common host process, but creating files in system directories could be suspicious. Maybe a legitimate operation, but worth checking.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe creating files in user directories. The first one is StartupProfileData-NonInteractive, which might be part of PowerShell's normal operations. The second is a file named entrada_principal.txt. Creating text files might not be harmful, but the presence of multiple file creations could be a red flag. Also, a registry value set by powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry changes can be part of malware configuration.\n\nChrome.exe loading an image from a Defender DLL. That seems normal since Defender is a legitimate security software. The path looks correct, so maybe that's just a regular process.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files might be normal. But the path is in the user's Downloads directory, which could be a sign of someone manually setting up the tool. However, the user might have done that themselves.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, the repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" events are concerning. If that's happening multiple times, it could indicate an attack. Also, the combination of file creations in unusual locations and registry changes might suggest malicious activity. However, some of these processes are legitimate. The key is whether these events are part of normal operations or an attack.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The presence of multiple remote command executions is a red flag, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the repetition and the combination with other events like file creation and registry changes might indicate a higher risk. I'd lean towards classifying this as interesting, but not certain. Maybe around 0.75 confidence. The justification would be the multiple remote command executions and suspicious file operations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events (possibly indicating remote code execution) combined with suspicious file creation activities (e.g., 'unidade_comum' in system directories, PowerShell creating arbitrary files) and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
