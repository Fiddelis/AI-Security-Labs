Maybe it's part of some software, but the name doesn't ring a bell. The files are being created in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which is usually for Office add-ins or solutions. However, the filenames include \"copilot,\" which might relate to Microsoft Copilot, but I'm not sure if that's legitimate here.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're all in the user's AppData Local folder, which is common for user-specific data. But creating multiple files with unique hashes could be part of a legitimate update or installation. However, the repetition of the same process and the same directory might indicate something else. \n\nWait, the same file paths are repeated multiple times. Each entry is a FileCreated event. If these files are being created multiple times by the same process, that could be normal if it's part of a package installation. But if the files are being created in a way that's not typical, like in a location where they shouldn't be, that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, the use of a hash in the filename might be a way to uniquely identify each file, which is common in software distribution. However, the fact that all these files are being created by SDXHelper.exe might be a sign that this process is involved in some kind of deployment. But is SDXHelper.exe a known legitimate process? I don't recall it being part of standard Microsoft Office. Maybe it's a third-party tool or part of some add-in.\n\nAnother angle: the classification as \"interesting\" would be if there's a potential security threat. If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, then this might not be an issue. But if it's a malicious process, creating these files could be part of malware activity. However, without more context, like other events (e.g., network activity, registry changes), it's hard to tell. \n\nThe justification would need to be concise. The repetition of the same process creating similar files in a specific directory might be normal, but the lack of variation in the files and the process name could be suspicious.

But the confidence level might be moderate because there's not enough data to confirm malicious intent. \n\nAlternatively, if these files are part of a known legitimate package, then it's not interesting.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, all showing files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names that start with \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\" followed by a hash-like string and a .js extension.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior or something suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in handling solution packages, which might include add-ins or other components. But creating a bunch of JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles folder... Hmm. Office usually uses these folders for caching or storing resources, but the number of files here seems high. There are 15 entries, and some files are being created multiple times. For example, the same file path appears twice for some entries. That repetition might be a red flag. \n\nWait, but maybe the user is just installing or updating some Office add-in that requires these files. However, the file names have those long hash strings, which could be indicative of generated or unique identifiers. But if it's a legitimate process, would it create so many files? Also, the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is a known legitimate process, but that doesn't mean it's not being exploited here. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the directory structure. The files are in the \"OfflineFiles\" subdirectory under SolutionPackages. Microsoft Office does use OfflineFiles for storing resources when working offline, but the presence of multiple JavaScript files with those names might be part of a legitimate update or installation. However, the sheer number of files and the repetition might be unusual. \n\nBut wait, looking at the file paths again, they all have the same base directory. The hashes in the filenames might be part of different versions or updates. However, if this is part of a normal installation, there should be logs or other events indicating that. Since these are all FileCreate events, maybe it's just a normal process. However, the repetition of the same file being created multiple times could indicate an issue. \n\nAlternatively, the hash strings might be random, but the fact that they are all in the same directory and created by the same process might be a sign of something else. Maybe a malicious actor is using SDXHelper.exe to inject their own files. But SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, so it's possible that it's being used as a vector for malicious activity. However, without more context, like other events such as network activity or process injections, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe classification here depends on whether the behavior is out of the ordinary. If the system is expected to have such file creations, then it's not interesting. But if this is an unusual number of files or if the process is not typically creating these types of files, it might be a concern. \n\nSince all the events are about file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a legitimate Office directory, but with a high number of files and repetition, I'm leaning towards \"INTERESTING\" because the volume and repetition might indicate an anomaly. However, the confidence might be moderate since it's not definitive without more data. The justification would be the high number of files created in a specific directory by a process that's normally legitimate, which could be a sign of malicious activity or an unusual legitimate process.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple JavaScript files with hash-based names are created in Office's OfflineFiles directory by SDXHelper.exe.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. The user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each indicating that SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in a specific directory under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages.\n\nFirst, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the Office Deployment Tool or Click-to-Run. It's usually involved in installing or updating Office components. So, if it's creating files in the SolutionPackages directory, that might be normal behavior during an update or installation.\n\nBut wait, the files being created are JavaScript files named things like \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_...\" with hashes in the names. That seems a bit odd. Normally, Office updates might have DLLs or other binaries, but JavaScript files in that directory? Maybe it's part of some new feature or copilot integration. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be a red flag. Are these files being created multiple times by the same process? Looking at the logs, some entries have the same file paths repeated. That could indicate either a benign process that's writing files multiple times (maybe during different stages of an installation) or a potential malicious activity where the same file is being created repeatedly, possibly to obfuscate or test something.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the directory path. The files are in \"OfflineFiles\" under SolutionPackages. That might be a temporary directory used during installation. However, if these files are being created in a user's AppData folder, it's possible that they're part of a legitimate update. But I should also check if there's any indication of unusual behavior. For example, if SDXHelper.exe is typically not creating JavaScript files, that could be suspicious. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact role of SDXHelper.exe in this context.\n\nAlso, looking at the event rule \"FileCreate\" – if the system's SIEM or log monitoring tool is flagging these as created files, maybe there's a rule that considers this activity as suspicious. However, if the process is legitimate and the files are part of a known update, then it's not an issue. \n\nAnother angle: the filenames include \"copilot-strings\". Microsoft Excel Copilot is a new feature, so maybe these are localization files or string resources for that feature. If that's the case, then the creation of these JS files would be normal. However, the repeated creation of the same files might still be worth investigating. Maybe the process is failing and retrying, or there's an error in the installation. Alternatively, if the files are being created in a non-standard location or by an unexpected process, that would be a concern.\n\nBut all the logs here show the same process (SDXHelper.exe) creating these files in a specific path. If that's the expected behavior for an Office update, then it's not interesting. However, if there's no prior knowledge of SDXHelper.exe creating JS files in that directory, it might be worth looking into. \n\nI think the key here is whether the process and the file creation are part of a known legitimate activity. If yes, then it's not interesting. If not, then it's suspicious. Given that SDXHelper.exe is a Microsoft process, and the files are in a directory related to Office SolutionPackages, it's possible that this is a legitimate update. However, the presence of JavaScript files in that context might be unusual, and the repetition could indicate something wrong. \n\nBut without more context, like other events or indicators of compromise, it's hard to say. The logs don't show any other processes or anomalous activities. So, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" if this is a known legitimate process, but \"INTERESTING\" if there's a reason to doubt the legitimacy. \n\nGiven that SDXHelper.exe is a known Microsoft process, and the files are in a directory that's part of Office's package management, I'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a moderate confidence. However, the repeated file creation might still be a point of concern. Maybe the confidence is around 0.6 or 0.7. But I should check if there's any known information about SDXHelper.exe creating JS files in that location. If not, then it's more suspicious.

That seems like a unique identifier, maybe for different versions or components. But creating multiple files with different hashes might indicate that they're different resources being downloaded. However, the same file is being created multiple times, which might be a red flag. Like, why are there duplicates?\n\nAlso, the path is in the user's AppData Local folder, which is a common place for temporary files or user-specific data. But if these files are being created by SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process, maybe it's just part of an update. However, the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times could suggest something's off. Maybe the process is looping or there's a misconfiguration.\n\nAnother thing to consider: are these files expected? If Excel Copilot is a feature that requires these JavaScript files, then maybe it's normal. But if the user hasn't installed or used that feature, then it might be unusual. However, without more context on the user's system or recent activities, it's hard to say.\n\nBut the key point here is that all the events are related to the same process and the same directory.

I'm not immediately familiar with that process. Maybe it's a legitimate part of some Office solution or a helper tool? But then again, sometimes malicious software uses similar names to blend in. The fact that it's creating multiple files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory might be normal if it's part of an installation or update process. However, the repetition of the same process name and the same directory path for each file creation could indicate something else. \n\nWait, but looking at the file paths, they're all in the user's AppData folder under Microsoft Office. That's a common location for temporary or cached files. The filenames have \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\" which makes me think they might be related to Excel Copilot, a feature in newer versions of Excel. If that's the case, maybe these files are part of a legitimate update or resource pack.

If it's a legitimate process, would it create so many files in that directory? Maybe not. Also, the fact that the same process is creating each file might be a red flag. Typically, legitimate processes might create a few files, but not multiple files with similar names and different hashes in quick succession. \n\nAnother angle: the hashes in the filenames. If these are legitimate resources, they might have consistent naming conventions. But the different hashes could be part of different versions or updates. However, if the process is creating these files without user interaction, that might be suspicious. \n\nWait, but the user's name here is \"fiddelis\".

If it's part of Office, then it's expected. But if this process is not associated with Microsoft Office, that would be a red flag. However, the user hasn't provided any information about the system's status or if SDXHelper.exe is legitimate in their environment. Assuming it's legitimate, then these file creations are normal.\n\nHowever, the fact that multiple files are being created with similar names might be part of a package deployment. For example, during an Office update, multiple resources might be extracted. The hashes in the filenames could be unique identifiers for different versions or components. So, each file might be a different part of the same package.\n\nBut wait, the same file is being created multiple times. Wait, looking at the logs, each entry is a separate log line, but each line shows the same file being created. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the files have different hashes. For example, the first entry is min_01b8..., then min_0281..., then min_05e9..., etc. So each log entry is a different file. So, the process is creating multiple different files, each with unique hashes, all in the same directory. That might be part of a larger package being installed or updated.\n\nAnother angle: the use of \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" in the winlog task. This is likely from a security tool or monitoring system that logs file creation events. If this is a normal activity, then it's okay. But if the system is being monitored and these files are part of a legitimate update, then it's fine. However, if SDXHelper.exe is not a legitimate process, then it could be malware.\n\nBut without more context, like whether the user is seeing this on their own system or it's part of a hypothetical scenario, it's hard to say. Assuming the logs are from a legitimate Office update, then it's normal. But if the user is concerned about malware, they might need to check if SDXHelper.exe is a genuine Microsoft process.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information given, the activity seems to be part of a legitimate Office update or installation process. However, without knowing the system's context, there's a possibility that it could be malicious. But given the file paths and the process name, it's more likely legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that the `SDXHelper.exe` process, associated with Microsoft Office, is creating multiple JavaScript files in the `SolutionPackages` directory. These files, named with unique hashes (e.g., `min_01b8...`), appear to be part of a legitimate Office update or installation process. The filenames suggest they are minified resources for the AI Copilot feature, which is a known component of newer Office versions.

The confidence level would be moderate here. Maybe the system is trying to install something, but without more info, it's hard to tell.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a file creation event by the SDXHelper process.\n\nFirst, looking at the process name: SDXHelper.exe. I'm not too familiar with this exact name, but I know that sometimes legitimate software can have processes with names that seem a bit generic. However, I should check if this is a known legitimate process or if it's associated with any malware. Maybe I should think about common malicious activities. \n\nNext, looking at the file paths. The first few entries have paths like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages... Wait, the user has a typo here? The username is \"fiddelis\" but in the first entries, it's \"fidelis\"? Wait, no, looking again, the first entries have \"fiddelis\" in the path. Wait, the username in the first entry is \"fidelis\" but in the later entries, it's \"fiddelis\"? Wait, no, let me check again. \n\nWait, the first entries have \"C:\\Users\\fidelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages...\" but then later entries have \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages...\". Wait, is that a typo? Like, maybe the username was mistyped as \"fidelis\" in some entries and \"fiddelis\" in others? Or maybe that's a mistake in the data. Hmm, that might be a red flag. If the username is inconsistent, that could indicate a problem, but maybe it's just a typo in the log entries. \n\nAnother thing to note is the file names. They all seem to be JavaScript files, like officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js. The naming convention here is a bit odd. The term \"aicopilot\" might be a typo for \"ai copilot\" or \"AI Copilot\", which is a feature in some Microsoft products. But the presence of multiple JavaScript files with similar names could be part of a legitimate update or installation, or it could be malicious code being dropped. \n\nThe process creating these files is SDXHelper.exe. I should check if this is a known process. A quick mental check: SDXHelper isn't a standard Windows process. Legitimate processes usually have more descriptive names. If this process is creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory, that might be suspicious. \n\nAnother point is the repetition of the same files being created multiple times. For example, the same file path appears multiple times. That might indicate that the process is attempting to create the same files repeatedly, which could be a sign of a failed operation or maybe a script trying to overwrite files. \n\nAlso, looking at the timestamps or the order of events. But since the logs are provided without timestamps, I can't tell the sequence. However, the repetition of the same file creation events might be a red flag. \n\nThe presence of multiple files with different hash suffixes (like min_4726a43d02d002f8ddd67945b7245415.js) suggests that these are different versions or parts of a larger set. However, if they are all being created by the same process in the same directory, that might be part of a legitimate installation, but it's also possible that this is part of a malicious payload. \n\nAnother angle: the directory structure. The files are being created in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages folder. If SDXHelper is a legitimate part of Office, maybe this is normal. However, if SDXHelper is not a known Office component, then this is suspicious. \n\nI should also consider the possibility of a typo in the process name. For example, \"SDXHelper\" might be a misspelling of a legitimate process, but I can't think of any. \n\nPutting it all together: multiple file creations by an unknown process (SDXHelper.exe) in a Microsoft Office directory, with JavaScript files that have names that might be related to AI Copilot but I'm not sure. Wait, the user's input has some inconsistencies in the paths. For example, in the first entries, the path is \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fidelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages...\" but later entries have \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages...\". Wait, that's a typo in the username: \"fidelis\" vs \"fiddelis\". That might be a mistake in the data, but maybe it's a red herring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the username is \"fidelis\" but the typo is in the input. Either way, the key point is that multiple files are being created in that directory by the SDXHelper process. \n\nNow, considering that SDXHelper might be a legitimate process, but creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office packages directory could be suspicious. However, I need to check if SDXHelper is a known legitimate process. If it's not, then this could be malicious. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the repetition of file creation, the same file names, and the presence of multiple entries might indicate some automated process or potential malicious activity. \n\nAnother angle: the filenames have \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" which might be a typo. Wait, looking at the filenames: \"officeaicopilot-strings.min...\" but the correct term might be \"officeai copilot\" or something else. However, that's speculative. \n\nGiven that all the events are about creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory by the same process, and considering that the filenames are JavaScript files, it's possible that this is related to some kind of extension or add-in. However, the repeated creation of the same files might indicate an attempt to inject code or modify the Office environment. \n\nAlternatively, this could be a legitimate process if SDXHelper is part of a software that's installing resources for Office. However, without knowing the context of SDXHelper, it's hard to say. But given that the user is asking for classification, and considering that multiple files are being created in a specific directory by the same process, this might be worth investigating. \n\nSo, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" because there's a pattern of multiple file creations in a specific directory by the same process, which could indicate malicious activity, especially if the files are JavaScript which can be used for scripting. The confidence might be around 0.7 because while the activity is suspicious, without more context, it's not definitive. However, the repetition and the specific paths might be red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office-related directories, suggesting potential malicious activity or unusual behavior warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries. Each one shows that the SDXHelper.exe process created a file in a specific path under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with a pattern like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by a hash and .js.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what these files are. The names suggest they're JavaScript files related to \"officeaicopilot-strings,\" which might be part of a Microsoft Office add-in or some kind of AI copilot feature. The repeated entries with the same file names and hashes could indicate that the process is creating multiple instances of these files, maybe for caching or localization purposes.\n\nNow, considering the task is to determine if there's anything suspicious here. The process is SDXHelper.exe. I should check if that's a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the Office Deployment Tool or some kind of setup utility. However, sometimes malware can masquerade as legitimate processes. But in this case, the files are being created in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which seems legitimate for Office-related files.\n\nBut wait, the fact that there are multiple files being created with similar names and hashes might be normal if they're different language packs or versions. However, the repetition of the same file names could also be a sign of something malicious, like a dropper or a downloader that's creating multiple copies. But without more context, like the hashes being known malicious ones or the process not being signed, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother angle: the file paths are all in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office directory, which is a common location for temporary or user-specific files. Office might use that directory for various resources. The use of the SolutionPackages folder suggests it's part of an Office add-in or package deployment. The FileCreate rule in the winlog indicates that the system is monitoring file creation, which is normal for security purposes.\n\nHowever, the user might be concerned about these files being created by SDXHelper.exe. If this is part of a legitimate Office installation or update, then it's normal. But if the user hasn't initiated any Office updates or installations, this could be suspicious. Also, checking if SDXHelper.exe is signed by Microsoft would help confirm its legitimacy.\n\nIn summary, the logs show SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in a legitimate Office directory. Unless there are other indicators of compromise (like unexpected network activity, unauthorized access, etc.), this might be normal. But without additional context, it's hard to be certain.

These files appear to be JavaScript files (`.js`) named with hashes or identifiers that suggest they may be part of localization or resource packages for an application (possibly Office-related, given the path structure). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **File Naming Pattern**: The filenames include variations like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`, which suggests they are part of a localization bundle (e.g., strings for different languages or locales). The `.min` suffix indicates minified code, which is common in web and application development for performance optimization.\n\n2. **Location**: The files are stored under `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`, which is a typical location for Microsoft Office-related files, particularly in the context of Office 365 or other Microsoft productivity suites. The `SolutionPackages` directory is often used for storing add-ins, templates, or other resources associated with Office applications.\n\n3. **Process Involvement**: The `SDXHelper.exe` process is responsible for creating these files. This process is not a standard Microsoft process, and its presence may indicate third-party software, an Office add-in, or a custom tool related to Office.\n\n4. **Potential Purpose**: The files could be part of an Office add-in or a localization package for an Office application. The repeated creation of similar files might indicate updates, reinstallation, or conflicts with the software.\n\n### Implications:\n- **Legitimacy**: The files and process may be legitimate, especially if they are associated with a trusted Office add-in or Microsoft software. However, the presence of `SDXHelper.exe` could also be a red flag, as it is not a standard Microsoft process and may be associated with malware in some contexts.\n  \n- **Security Considerations**: If `SDXHelper.exe` is not recognized or is behaving suspiciously (e.g., generating a large number of files, consuming excessive resources), it may be advisable to investigate further, such as by checking the file's digital signature, running a virus scan, or reviewing system logs for anomalies.\n\n- **Performance Impact**: The repeated creation of files in the `OfflineFiles` directory may indicate that the application is attempting to cache or download resources locally, which could be normal behavior but may also be a sign of inefficiency or an attempt to bypass network restrictions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe files appear to be part of a legitimate software distribution process, possibly related to an Office add-in or localization package. However, further investigation into the `SDXHelper.exe` process and the files' origins is recommended to ensure they are not malicious."}

The fact that multiple files are being created with different hashes (the long strings in the filenames) might be normal for different versions or updates.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious. If these files are being created by a legitimate process, it's probably okay. But if SDXHelper.exe is being used by malware to drop files, that's a problem. How can I tell? Well, checking the hash of the files might help, but the user hasn't provided that info. Alternatively, looking at the process's behavior: if it's only creating these files and not doing anything else suspicious, it's more likely legitimate.\n\nAlso, the filenames have \"min\" in them, which stands for minified JavaScript. That's common in web development for production code, so it's another sign that these are probably legitimate resources.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if there's a threat. Even though SDXHelper.exe is legitimate, could there becauase of that, I need to check if there are any other indicators of compromise. \n\nAnother angle: the filenames include \"offlinefiles\", which might be part of a package that's meant to be used offline. If the user is running Office in an environment where offline access is needed, this is normal. However, if the system is not supposed to have these files, or if the files are being created in unexpected locations, that's a red flag.\n\nSince the user hasn't provided any other suspicious activity (like unexpected network connections, high CPU usage, etc.), and assuming that SDXHelper.exe is legitimate, this might be a normal process. However, the repetitive nature of the filenames and the use of \"min\" in the filename might indicate that these are minified resources, which is common in web apps but less so in desktop apps. \n\nWait, but the files are being created by a process related to Office, so maybe they're just part of the setup. However, the fact that the same file is being logged multiple times (as per the example) could be a sign of a loop or a malicious payload. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn conclusion, unless there are other signs of malicious activity, this might just be a normal process. But I should recommend further analysis, like checking the file hashes against known good ones, monitoring for other unusual behavior, and ensuring that the SDXHelper.exe is indeed the legitimate one from Microsoft.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided data indicates a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, with files being created as part of the Copilot feature's resources. Here's the analysis:\n\n**1. Process Legitimacy:**  \n`SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate component of Microsoft Office, involved in deploying or managing add-ins\/solutions. Its presence here is expected.\n\n**2. File Context:**  \n- Filenames like `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` and `word-copilot.min.js` align with Microsoft Copilot's resource files, which are used for offline functionality.  \n- The `OfflineFiles` subdirectory is a standard location for cached or packaged resources in Office applications.\n\n**3. No Immediate Threat Detected:**  \n- The files are created by a legitimate process in a standard directory.  \n- No signs of unusual behavior (e.g., unexpected network activity, unauthorized access, or non-standard file types) are present in the provided data.  \n\n**4. Recommendations:**  \n- Verify the digital signature of `SDXHelper.exe` to ensure it's the genuine Microsoft-signed version.  \n- Monitor for unexpected file modifications or additional processes that might indicate a compromise.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe activity described is consistent with normal Office operations. No security threat is evident from this data alone.  \n\n**Confidence:** 0.95 (High confidence in legitimacy, but further verification is recommended)."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All the entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are JavaScript files with names that include \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" and \"word-copilot.min\". \n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, so it's possible that it's legitimately creating these files as part of an update or installation process. However, the repetition of the same filenames and the presence of multiple entries for the same file might indicate something else. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they are all within the Office SolutionPackages directory, which is a known location for Office add-ins or updates. The filenames suggest they might be part of a copilot feature, which Microsoft has been rolling out. However, the fact that there are multiple instances of the same file being created could be a red flag. \n\nBut wait, maybe the same file is being created multiple times due to different package versions. The hashes in the filenames (like e4c0785d28a655cfa8c7e561caea1f62) might be unique identifiers for different versions or packages. If the same file is being created multiple times under different package directories, that could be normal. However, if the same file is being created multiple times in the same package directory, that might be suspicious.\n\nLooking closer, some entries have the same file path repeated, like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_e4c0785d28a655cfa8c7e561caea1f62.js\" appearing twice. That might indicate an attempt to overwrite or repeatedly create the same file, which could be a sign of malicious activity. However, without more context, such as other events like network connections or process injections, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nAnother point is the process name, SDXHelper.exe. If this process is known to be legitimate, then the activity might be normal. However, if there's any indication that SDXHelper.exe is being used maliciously, then this could be a problem. But based solely on the information provided, there's no evidence of that.\n\nConsidering all this, the repeated creation of the same files might be part of a normal update process, but the repetition could also be suspicious. Since the classification requires determining if the batch is interesting, the presence of multiple identical file creations might warrant further investigation.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is that all the events are about files being created by a process called SDXHelper.exe. \n\nFirst, I notice that the process name is SDXHelper.exe. I should check if that's a legitimate process. From what I remember, Microsoft Office might use some helper processes, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the file paths mentioned are in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. That seems a bit unusual because typically, Office might store temporary files or packages in such locations, but creating multiple JavaScript files with names like \"word-copilot.min_...\" and \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" might be suspicious.\n\nWait, the filenames have \"copilot\" and \"strings\" in them. Microsoft 365 Copilot is a real feature, but the way these files are being created might be a red flag. The fact that SDXHelper.exe is creating so many files with different hashes (the parts after the min_ in the filenames) could indicate that these are being generated dynamically, possibly as part of an attack. \n\nAlso, looking at the paths, they all start with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\. The user might have a typo in the username (fiddelis vs. fidelis?), but that's probably not relevant. The key point is that these files are being created in a directory associated with Office solutions. If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, why are so many files being created there? Maybe it's part of an update or installation, but the repetition of the same filenames with different hashes suggests something else.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the number of events. There are multiple entries for the same file being created, which might be redundant. However, the different hashes indicate different versions or possibly malicious payloads. The fact that the same process is creating multiple files with varying hashes in a short period could be indicative of malware trying to drop files. \n\nBut wait, maybe SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate helper tool for Office, and these files are part of a package or add-in. However, the naming convention of the files doesn't align with standard Office files. Legitimate Office packages usually have more standard names and might not be JavaScript files. Also, the presence of multiple files with similar names but different hashes might be a sign of evasion techniques used by malware to avoid detection.\n\nI should also check if there are any known threats related to SDXHelper.exe. But since I don't have access to external databases, I have to rely on patterns. The combination of a helper process creating numerous JavaScript files in an Office-related directory with varying hashes is suspicious. It's possible that these files are being used to inject malicious code or to communicate with a C2 server.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a chance this could be a legitimate process, the pattern of multiple file creations with different hashes in a non-standard location raises enough suspicion to warrant further investigation. Therefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files with suspicious names (e.g., 'word-copilot.min_...', 'officeaicopilot-strings.min_...') are being created in Microsoft Office-related directories by 'SDXHelper.exe', which may indicate malicious activity such as file injection or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a series of log entries, all from the SDXHelper.exe process, each indicating that a file was created in specific paths under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The task is to analyze these logs and determine if there's any suspicious activity or if they're just normal operations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what SDXHelper.exe does. From what I recall, SDXHelper is part of Microsoft's Office applications, possibly related to the Office Insider or some kind of helper service for updates or features. But I'm not 100% sure. The files being created are in the SolutionPackages directory, which might be related to Office add-ins or solutions. The filenames have parts like \"OfflineFiles\" and \"word-copilot.min\", which makes me think they could be related to Copilot features in Word, which is a newer feature by Microsoft.\n\nLooking at the paths, they are all under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. That seems like a legitimate location for Office to store package resources. The process creating the files is SDXHelper.exe. If that's a legitimate process, then these file creations might be normal. However, if SDXHelper.exe is not a legitimate process, it could be malware.\n\nBut how can I verify if SDXHelper.exe is legitimate? Well, checking the file's digital signature would help. Legitimate Microsoft processes usually have valid signatures. Also, the presence of multiple files with similar names but different hashes might indicate updates or different versions being deployed. However, the logs here only show creation events, not modifications.\n\nAnother angle: the filenames include \"copilot\" and \"chatstrings\", which might be related to AI features in Office, like Copilot. If the user has Office 365 with Copilot enabled, these files could be part of that feature. However, the repetition of some files (like word-copilot.min appearing twice) might be redundant, but that's not necessarily suspicious unless there's a pattern of excessive file creation.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided any context about the environment. Are these logs from a system that's part of a corporate network, or a personal machine? If it's a personal machine, maybe the user is using Office with Copilot enabled. If it's a corporate machine, maybe there's an insider threat or malware.\n\nBut the problem is that without knowing the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe, it's hard to say. However, the fact that all these files are created by the same process in a known Office directory might be normal. However, the presence of multiple files with similar names and the specific mention of \"chatstrings\" and \"copilot\" might be part of a legitimate feature rollout.\n\nAlternatively, if SDXHelper.exe is not a known Microsoft process, that could be a red flag. But assuming that the user is on a system where SDXHelper.exe is legitimate, then these logs are normal. However, the confidence level would depend on how certain I am about the process's legitimacy.\n\nIn the absence of more information, I might lean towards these being legitimate operations, but with a moderate confidence level because the process name is somewhat obscure and the filenames are specific. However, if the user is in a security context, they might want to verify the process's authenticity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs show multiple file creation events by **SDXHelper.exe** in the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages** directory, with filenames related to **Copilot** (e.g., `word-copilot.min.js`) and **chatstrings**. These files are stored in the `OfflineFiles` subdirectory, which is consistent with Office's use of local caching for features like Copilot, an AI-powered assistant in Microsoft 365 apps. \n\n### Analysis:\n- **Legitimacy**: The process `SDXHelper.exe` is associated with Microsoft Office, particularly with features like Copilot. The file paths and names align with legitimate Office operations, such as caching language-specific strings or JavaScript files for offline functionality.\n- **Repetition**: Some files (e.g., `word-copilot.min.js`) are logged multiple times, but this could reflect updates, versioning, or redundant logging rather than malicious activity.\n- **No Red Flags**: No anomalies (e.g., unusual permissions, non-standard paths, or unexpected process behavior) are evident in the provided data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe activity appears to be **legitimate**, likely related to **Microsoft Office Copilot** or similar features. However, the confidence is **moderate** (0.7) because the process name (`SDXHelper.exe`) is less commonly known to end-users, and further verification (e.g., checking the process's digital signature or behavior) could confirm its legitimacy. \n\n**Answer:**\n- **Confidence**: 0.7\n- **Conclusion**: The file creations are likely legitimate Office operations, possibly related to Copilot features."}
