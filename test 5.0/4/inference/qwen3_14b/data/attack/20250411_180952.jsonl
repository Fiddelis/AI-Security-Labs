{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is svchost.exe creating a file in the System32\\sru directory. SRUtmp.log is part of the System Resource Usage tracking, so that's a legitimate system file. Maybe a normal system process, so not suspicious here.\n\nThe second event is winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so it's possible that this is part of its normal operation when configuring itself. The path is in the user's Downloads folder, which is common for installations. Not immediately alarming, but maybe worth checking if the file was expected.\n\nThird and fourth events are both from powershell.exe. One is a registry value set, the other is a process accessed. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but without more context, like the specific registry keys changed or which processes were accessed, it's hard to tell. These could be normal or part of a script. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events might indicate some automated activity, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at all together, there's no clear sign of a security breach. The files created are in expected locations for their respective processes. The PowerShell activities don't have enough details to flag them. So, maybe this isn't interesting. But I should check if any of these paths are unusual. The SRUtmp.log is standard. The winlogbeat file is in the Downloads folder, which is okay if it's a user-initiated install. The PowerShell events are common. So overall, not interesting. Confidence around 0.3 since there's no clear malicious activity, but not entirely certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve legitimate system processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe) and common administrative activities (powershell.exe registry\/process access). File creation paths align with expected locations for system logs and user-installed software. No suspicious patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. First, I need to scan through all the events to see if there's anything suspicious. The user mentioned that the classification should be based on the entire batch, so I can't just look at individual events but need to see patterns or combinations.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe doing a DNS query, MpDefenderCoreService.exe having a network connection, and chrome.exe doing similar things. Those might be normal, as svchost is a common system process, and chrome would have network activity. But then there's a lot of chrome.exe entries with network connections. Maybe that's normal browsing, but maybe not. However, the real red flags start later.\n\nLooking further down, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that adds a user to the domain with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and adds them to the Domain Admins group. That's a big red flag. Creating domain admin accounts with temporary passwords sounds like a security risk. Also, the command line uses \"net user\" and \"net group\" commands, which are typically used for user management. But the presence of these commands in a suspicious context, especially if done by an unauthorized user, is concerning.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe accessing the registry, which could be normal, but combined with the user creation, it might indicate someone trying to modify system settings or escalate privileges. Also, the use of \"net1.exe\" instead of \"net.exe\" might be a typo or a malicious replacement. The fact that \"net1.exe\" is being used to add users and groups could be a sign of a compromised system or an attempt to manipulate the network configuration.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation event for winlogbeat.yml.new, which might be related to logbeat configuration, but if it's being created in a user's downloads folder, that might not be a big issue. However, the other file created by powershell.exe is \"pacote_base.txt\" â€“ not sure what that is, but if it's part of a larger attack, it could be a data exfiltration step.\n\nThe presence of multiple process creations for cmd.exe and net.exe with domain-related commands suggests someone is trying to add users to the domain and grant them administrative privileges. This is a clear indicator of potential malicious activity, especially if these actions are not part of a legitimate administrative task. The use of temporary passwords and adding users to Domain Admins is a strong sign of compromise.\n\nAlso, the repeated use of \"net1.exe\" instead of \"net.exe\" might be a typo, but it's possible that the attacker is using a malicious binary to avoid detection. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure, but the overall pattern of creating domain admin accounts and modifying the registry is suspicious.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the classification should be INTERESTING because there's a clear attempt to add users to the Domain Admins group, which is a high-risk activity. The confidence level is high because these actions are not typical in normal user behavior and are likely part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin accounts with temporary passwords, unauthorized use of 'net' and 'net1' commands to add users\/groups to Domain Admins, and frequent registry modifications by cmd\/powershell processes. These actions indicate potential privilege escalation and lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
