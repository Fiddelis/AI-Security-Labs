{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal, maybe part of an installation or configuration. Then there's powershell.exe creating a file called entrada_ativo.txt. Not sure what that is, but PowerShell is common for both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nNext, there are two instances of ProcessAccess events related to powershell.exe. The third event mentions ProcessAccess with no file, and the fifth is another ProcessAccess. The fourth event is whoami.exe being executed, which is a standard command to check user context. That's usually benign.\n\nHmm, but why are there multiple ProcessAccess events? Maybe something is trying to access processes, which could be part of a legitimate script or maybe a malicious attempt to inject code. However, without more context like network activity or other suspicious files, it's hard to tell. The presence of whoami.exe is normal. The other files created are in the Downloads folder, which is common for user activities. \n\nI don't see any obvious signs of malware here. The events don't indicate unauthorized access, unusual commands, or known malicious file names. The classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. But I'm not 100% confident. Maybe a confidence around 0.4, since there's some unusual activity but not enough to confirm a threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show standard file creation and process access activities, including legitimate tools (winlogbeat, PowerShell, whoami) operating in typical user directories (Downloads). No suspicious indicators like unexpected network activity, privilege escalation, or known malicious payloads are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the JSON entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's powershell.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, and others like chrome.exe. The winlog events mention things like Registry value set, Process Create, Image loaded, and File created. \n\nThe first event is powershell.exe with a Registry value set. Not too suspicious on its own. But then there's a cmd.exe process that runs schtasks to create a scheduled task. The command line here is important. It's creating a task that runs powershell.exe with -ep bypass and a script path. The script name is \"c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\". The filename includes \"NonExistingScript\", which might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to hide the real script name or it's a typo. Also, the task is set to run daily under the system account, which is a high-privilege account. That's a concerning setup.\n\nThen there's another schtasks.exe entry creating another task with a similar script path: \"c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Again, the same pattern of non-existing script names. The use of -ep bypass is a common technique to bypass execution policy restrictions in PowerShell, which is often used in attacks.\n\nThere are multiple entries of svchost.exe with Registry value sets. While svchost.exe is a normal system process, excessive registry changes could indicate something malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But combined with the scheduled tasks, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe File created events for winlogbeat and a text file might be benign, like log files or user activity. Chrome.exe entries with Registry changes are numerous but could be part of normal operations or extensions. However, the repetition might be worth noting.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of scheduled tasks with PowerShell scripts that don't exist, using bypass switches, and running under the system account are strong indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some entries might be normal, the combination here suggests an attempt to execute scripts with elevated privileges, which is a common attack vector. The confidence is high enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple scheduled tasks are created using schtasks.exe with PowerShell commands (-ep bypass) referencing non-existent scripts (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), indicating potential malicious execution attempts. The tasks are configured to run daily under the SYSTEM account, which is highly suspicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
