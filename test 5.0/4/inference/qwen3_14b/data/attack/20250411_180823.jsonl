{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve svchost.exe and chrome.exe performing registry value sets. There are also a few file creations, like the one for 'pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup' in the System32 Tasks directory. That seems suspicious because creating a scheduled task in that location could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. \n\nAnother file created is 'unidade_ativo.txt' by powershell.exe. While creating files isn't always bad, the path here is in the user's Downloads directory, which might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be part of something. \n\nLooking at the processes involved: svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, so it's normal to see it doing registry changes. However, chrome.exe loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll might be normal too, but the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe could be unusual. \n\nWait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. If chrome.exe is loading that, maybe it's legitimate. But then again, malware sometimes hooks into these DLLs. However, the main red flag here is the scheduled task creation. Creating a task in the System32 directory is a common technique for persistence. \n\nAlso, there are multiple registry value sets by different processes, but the key is whether they're modifying critical keys. The logs don't specify which registry keys are being changed, so that's a bit of a gap. However, the presence of a scheduled task creation is a strong indicator. \n\nAnother thing is the use of powershell.exe creating a file. That's not necessarily bad, but if combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the creation of a scheduled task in a system directory is a significant red flag. Even though other events might be benign, that one action suggests potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and chrome.exe, combined with the creation of a scheduled task in the System32\\\\Tasks directory (C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\Tasks\\\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup), which is a common indicator of persistence mechanisms used in malware.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, looking at the data. All the events are related to process activities and registry changes. The majority of them are about chrome.exe with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Then there are a couple of entries for powershell.exe and whoami.exe.\n\nHmm, chrome.exe modifying the registry. Normally, Chrome might make some registry changes during installation or updates, but if it's happening multiple times, maybe that's not normal. However, just chrome.exe modifying the registry alone might not be suspicious. But wait, there's also powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but if it's being accessed without a clear reason, that could be a red flag. \n\nThen there's the whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate tool to check user identity. But if it's being executed in a context where it shouldn't be, maybe that's an indicator of something. However, the command line shows it's just running normally from the system32 directory. That seems okay. \n\nLooking at the confidence. The events are all about registry changes by chrome.exe and some process accesses. But since chrome.exe is a common application, maybe the registry changes are part of normal operations. However, multiple registry changes by the same process could indicate something like a configuration change or maybe even a form of persistence. But without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. \n\nPowerShell being accessed might be normal too, but if there's a pattern of multiple accesses or combined with other suspicious activities, that could be a sign. However, in this batch, there's not enough information to confirm that. The whoami.exe is a low-risk process. \n\nPutting it all together, the batch has some potentially normal activities but nothing that clearly points to a security incident. The justification might be that there's no clear malicious activity detected. But wait, the user is asking to consider the combination of all events. If all the events are from legitimate processes and no unusual patterns, then it's not interesting. However, if there's a possibility that the registry changes are part of a larger attack, but without more data, it's hard to say. \n\nI think the classification here is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events are related to normal processes. Chrome modifying the registry could be part of its normal operations, and the other processes are legitimate. There's no clear sign of compromise or malicious activity. The confidence would be around 0.4, as there's some activity that could be normal, but not enough to be certain. However, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, if multiple registry changes by chrome are unusual, maybe that's a higher confidence. But without knowing the specific registry keys, it's hard. So, the justification would be that no clear malicious behavior is detected, hence not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe) performing normal operations (registry modifications, process access). No clear indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user provided a list of log entries that look like system events, probably from a Windows machine. Each entry has a process name, a winlog task, and sometimes a file path. The task is to analyze these logs and determine if there's any malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each entry one by one. The first few entries are about chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not suspicious. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying the registry. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that's okay. Notepad modifying the registry might be a red flag, but maybe it's just a legitimate action.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a legitimate tool. Then calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Calculator is a normal app, but urlmon.dll is part of Windows, so maybe that's okay. However, if it's being loaded from an unexpected place, that could be a problem. But the path here is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the standard location. So that might be normal.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process with a long command line. The command line includes creating scheduled tasks with names like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The command is using schtasks to create tasks that run calc.exe on logon or startup. This seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe might be an attempt to run malicious code at startup. The command line uses quotes and spaces, which is normal, but the fact that it's creating multiple tasks with specific names could be a red flag.\n\nAnother entry is schtasks.exe creating another task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same command to run calc.exe. This repetition might indicate an attempt to ensure that the malicious activity persists even if one task is removed.\n\nLooking at the file paths, there's a mention of taskschd.dll being loaded, which is part of the Task Scheduler, so that's normal. However, the creation of tasks in the System32\\Tasks directory is a common place for scheduled tasks, but if they're being created by an unexpected process, that's a problem.\n\nThe svchost.exe entries are modifying the registry. svchost is a legitimate Windows process that hosts multiple services, but if it's modifying the registry in a way that's not typical, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nPutting this all together, the most suspicious parts are the cmd.exe and schtasks.exe processes creating scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe. While calc.exe itself is a normal application, the fact that it's being triggered through scheduled tasks with names that include \"005\" might be part of a naming pattern used by malware. Additionally, the use of schtasks to create these tasks could be an attempt to maintain persistence on the system.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these could be legitimate. For example, if the user is running a script that sets up scheduled tasks for testing or automation, this might be normal. But given the presence of multiple tasks and the specific command lines, the likelihood of this being malicious is higher.\n\nAnother point is that the logs don't show any obvious indicators of compromise beyond the scheduled tasks. There's no mention of unexpected network connections or file modifications other than the tasks themselves. The registry modifications by svchost.exe could be part of normal system operations, but they might also be part of a more complex attack.\n\nIn conclusion, the key indicators here are the creation of scheduled tasks by cmd.exe and schtasks.exe that execute calc.exe. These actions are likely part of an attempt to establish persistence, which is a common tactic in malware. The confidence in this assessment would be moderate because while the actions are suspicious, they could also be part of legitimate system administration tasks.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate suspicious activity, particularly through the creation of scheduled tasks that execute `calc.exe` on system events (logon\/startup). Here's the analysis:\n\n- **Malicious Behavior**:  \n  The `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` processes are creating multiple scheduled tasks (e.g., `elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon`, `modulo_principal_005_OnStartup`) with commands to run `calc.exe`. While `calc.exe` is a legitimate system tool, its use here via scheduled tasks with cryptic names suggests **potential persistence mechanisms** or **obfuscation** (e.g., \"005\" may be part of a naming pattern used by malware).\n\n- **Legitimate vs. Suspicious**:  \n  Scheduled tasks are normal, but the **combination of `cmd.exe` with `schtasks` to create tasks** that run `calc.exe` (a low-privilege tool) is unusual. This could indicate an attempt to **execute arbitrary code** (e.g., if `calc.exe` is replaced or used as a dropper).\n\n- **Confidence in Detection**:  \n  The presence of multiple task creations, non-standard task names, and lack of clear benign context (e.g., no user interaction or documentation) raises **moderate to high suspicion**. However, without additional indicators (e.g., network activity, file modifications), the threat level is **not definitive**.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \nThe system likely has **malicious activity** related to **scheduled task persistence**, though further investigation is needed to confirm.\n\n**Answer**:  \n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Suspicious scheduled tasks created by cmd.exe and schtasks.exe to execute calc.exe, indicating potential persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
