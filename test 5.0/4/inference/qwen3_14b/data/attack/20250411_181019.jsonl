{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal, maybe part of an installation or configuration. But then there are multiple entries for chrome.exe and powershell.exe with registry value sets and process accesses. A lot of registry changes could be suspicious, especially if they're modifying key settings. However, chrome.exe loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll might be normal too, as those are part of Windows Defender. The repetition of chrome.exe events might indicate something, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The first event is the only file creation, and the rest are registry changes. Since there's no clear malicious activity like unexpected file downloads or execution of suspicious processes, maybe it's not interesting. But I'm not entirely sure. The confidence is moderate.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show normal system activity (e.g., Chrome loading legitimate DLLs, PowerShell and Calculator interacting with registry).

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and process creation events for whoami.exe and cmd.exe. The cmd.exe event has a command line that includes creating a service with a binPath pointing to a script that doesn't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1). That seems suspicious because creating a service with a non-existent script might be an attempt to execute malicious code later.\n\nThen there's an entry with sc.exe creating a service named win32times with a binPath that starts another script, also named NonExistingScript.ps1. This is similar to the previous one. Creating services with such paths could be a red flag, especially if the scripts are not found, which might indicate the attacker is trying to hide the actual payload or is part of a multi-stage attack.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple registry value set events involving services.exe, sc.exe, and cmd.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms, so that's another point to consider. Also, the ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll in both Calculator.exe and svchost.exe might be normal, but if those processes are not typically loading that DLL, it could be a sign of something malicious. However, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, so maybe that's not the main issue here.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell and cmd.exe to create services and modify the registry suggests someone is trying to establish persistence on the system. The fact that the scripts referenced don't exist might mean the attacker is planning to deploy them later or is using a technique to obfuscate their actions. Also, the use of sc.exe to create a service with a command that starts a script could be an attempt to run code under the guise of a legitimate service.\n\nHowever, some of the events, like the ones with notepad.exe or RuntimeBroker.exe, don't seem immediately suspicious. The majority of the events are related to process creation and registry changes, which are common in both legitimate and malicious activities. But the combination of creating services with non-existent scripts, multiple registry modifications, and the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for these actions is concerning.\n\nI should also check if there's any pattern of privilege escalation or unusual command-line arguments. The command_line in one of the cmd.exe entries has \"sc create win32times binPath= \\\"cmd \/c start c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\\\"\". The use of \"cmd \/c start\" to execute a script that doesn't exist might be a way to bypass some detection mechanisms or to delay execution until a later time.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch does show signs of potential malicious activity, such as service creation with non-existent scripts and multiple registry modifications. However, without more context, it's possible that some of these events could be part of normal system behavior. But given the repeated suspicious actions and the use of techniques commonly associated with attacks, the classification is likely \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.75 to 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of services with non-existent scripts (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), repeated registry modifications, and use of PowerShell\/cmd.exe for potentially malicious operations. These patterns suggest possible persistence mechanisms or attack attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
