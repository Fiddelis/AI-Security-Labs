Let me start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are several PowerShell processes being executed. The command lines look suspicious because they use the Start-Process cmdlet with paths that have '..\\..\\' which might be directory traversal attempts. For example, the first entry has \"C:\\\\objeto_padrao\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\..\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\entrada_base_script.bat\". The '..\\' could be trying to navigate up the directory tree, which is a common tactic in malware to hide the real path or access files in parent directories.\n\nThen, looking at the winlog tasks, there are entries under 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. I'm not too familiar with those specific tasks, but the fact that multiple PowerShell processes are starting other scripts might indicate something malicious. Also, there's an event where a file is created in the user's AppData directory, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files or configurations. The file path is 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. Creating a file in StartupProfileData might be an attempt to persist after reboot or execute code at startup.\n\nOther events involve Chrome and Calculator, but they're mostly registry changes, which might be normal. However, the repeated registry value sets for Chrome could be part of a larger attack, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The key points are the PowerShell commands with suspicious paths and the file creation in AppData.\n\nI should check if the paths in the command lines are legitimate. The '..\\' might be a red flag. Also, the fact that multiple scripts are being started from different directories with similar patterns could indicate a coordinated attack. The presence of 'entrada_base_script.bat' and similar names might be part of a script that's being executed multiple times, possibly to download or execute payloads.\n\nThe confidence level here would be around 0.75 because there are multiple suspicious PowerShell commands and a file created in a sensitive location. However, without more evidence like network activity or known malicious files, it's not 100% certain. But enough indicators to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands with suspicious directory traversal patterns (e.g., '..\\\\..\\\\') in file paths, which may indicate obfuscation or access to sensitive directories.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the logs and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser. Multiple network connections might be part of regular browsing, but maybe if there were a lot more, but here it's just a few instances. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe involved. The first notable event is a registry value set, which could be normal, but then there's a process creation event with a command line that starts a batch file. The path here is a bit odd with lots of backslashes and dots, maybe obfuscation? The command line is using Start-Process with a script that's in a directory that seems a bit convoluted. That might be a red flag.\n\nNext, there are several image loaded events for PowerShell. The files loaded include .NET DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell, but then there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of a script execution, but if it's a temporary script, that's normal. However, the fact that it's deleted right after might be something to check. Also, the file path includes __PSScriptPolicyTest, which might be related to script execution policies, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there are multiple Provider Lifecycle events with command lines that start various batch files. The paths here are similar, with long directory names and multiple dots, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual path. This could be a sign of something malicious trying to hide its tracks.\n\nThe repeated use of Start-Process with different batch files in different directories might indicate that PowerShell is being used to execute scripts, which is common but can also be part of attacks if the scripts are malicious. However, without seeing the actual content of the scripts, it's hard to tell. But the fact that multiple such events are logged could be worth investigating.\n\nAlso, the image loaded events include some .dll files from Windows Defender, which is normal, but the presence of those might just be part of the system's normal operations.\n\nPutting this all together, the main points of interest are the multiple PowerShell process creations with obfuscated paths, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the multiple Start-Process commands. These could be signs of a script-based attack, especially if the batch files are executing malicious code. However, without more context, like the actual content of the scripts or more anomalous behavior, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the number of events and the obfuscation in the paths, it's leaning towards being interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing obfuscated batch files with suspicious directory paths, coupled with temporary file creation\/deletion patterns, suggest potential script-based malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. The task is to analyze the entire batch and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the logs, most of them are about registry value sets and image loaded events. The processes involved are common ones like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. \n\nWait, there's a few entries where chrome.exe is loading DLLs. For example, amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Now, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender as well. But why would chrome.exe load these? Normally, these DLLs are part of the system's security features. However, if a legitimate process is loading a DLL from an unexpected path, that could be a red flag. But in these cases, the paths look like standard Windows Defender paths. Hmm, maybe that's normal.\n\nThen there are file creation events. One is from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files might be normal during setup. Another is powershell.exe creating text files in the Downloads directory. That might be normal user activity, unless there's something else. But the files are named \"componente_principal.txt\" and \"elemento_base.txt\" which are just generic names. Not sure if that's suspicious.\n\nNow, looking at the frequency. There are multiple entries of chrome.exe doing registry modifications. A lot of them. But is that normal? Chrome might modify the registry for its own settings, but maybe too many events could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother point: the presence of both FileCreate and ImageLoad events. The ImageLoad events for chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. But again, if those are legitimate, then it's okay. But if those DLLs were loaded from non-standard locations, that would be a problem. However, the paths here are standard.\n\nAlso, the user is using winlogbeat, which is a legitimate tool. The file creation there might be part of its normal operation. The other file created by powershell is in the Downloads folder, which is common for user-generated files.\n\nPutting it all together: there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The events seem to be part of normal system operations, even though there are multiple registry changes. Unless there's a specific rule that flags excessive registry modifications by chrome.exe, but based on the given information, I don't see obvious malicious behavior. So maybe this is not interesting. But I should check if there's any combination of events that could be suspicious. For example, if chrome.exe is modifying registry keys related to security or loading unexpected DLLs. But the DLLs here are from Windows Defender. So maybe it's just normal. Therefore, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent common system activities (e.g., registry modifications by Chrome, legitimate DLL loading by Chrome and Windows Defender, file creation by user processes and log shippers). No clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
