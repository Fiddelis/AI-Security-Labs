{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of events and activities:\n\n1. **System Boot and Initialization:**\n   - Several processes were started including `explorer.exe`, `services.exe`, and `svchost.exe`.\n   - Some registry values were set and images were loaded.\n\n2. **Windows Update Agent:**\n   - A Windows Update Agent event occurred, but no details are provided.\n\n3. **Idle Processes:**\n   - There are multiple logs indicating \"None\" for both process and winlog, suggesting idle or minimal system activity during this period.\n\n4. **PowerShell Execution:**\n   - An interesting event happened where PowerShell was used to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\". The binary path points to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n   ```\n   powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\" \\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n   ```\n\n5. **Provider and Engine Lifecycle Events:**\n   - After the PowerShell execution, there are multiple logs indicating Provider Lifecycle events followed by an Engine Lifecycle event.\n\nThese logs suggest that a new service was created using PowerShell, which might indicate suspicious activity as creating services requires administrative privileges. The repeated Provider and Engine Lifecycle events after this action could imply further activity related to the newly created service or the system's response to it.\n\nTo investigate further:\n- Check if the `tarefa_logico.exe` file is a legitimate Windows component or if it's from a third-party application.\n- Monitor the behavior of the \"objeto_ativo\" service to see if it's performing any unexpected actions.\n- Review any subsequent events or errors related to this service creation."}
