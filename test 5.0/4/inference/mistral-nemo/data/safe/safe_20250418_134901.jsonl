{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a summary of the events based on the logs you've provided:\n\n1. **Winlogbeat Installation and Configuration:**\n   - Winlogbeat was installed in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64` directory.\n   - The configuration file `.winlogbeat.yml.new` was created during the installation process.\n\n2. **Process and System Activity:**\n   - Several processes were active on the system:\n     - `svchost.exe`: This is a Windows service host process that manages background services. It performed multiple registry operations (set value, added\/deleted object).\n     - `notepad.exe`: Notepad was opened once.\n     - `chrome.exe`: Google Chrome browser was opened and performed several registry operations.\n     - `Calculator.exe`: The Calculator application was opened once.\n     - `setup.exe`: A setup process was executed which created a temporary file in `C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp`.\n   - Winlogbeat itself performed multiple file creation events.\n\n3. **Network Activity:**\n   - Chrome performed a DNS query, indicating some network activity.\n\n4. **File Operations:**\n   - Winlogbeat created two `.new` configuration files during its installation and operation.\n   - `setup.exe` created a temporary file `b8d633a2-08f3-4e51-85c3-3602fa580c63.tmp`.\n\n5. **Security Related Events:**\n   - No apparent security-related events or anomalies were detected based on the provided logs. However, this is a limited view and further analysis with more comprehensive logging would be required for conclusive statements.\n\nTo gain deeper insights, consider enabling more detailed logging, such as:\n- Enabling Microsoft's Advanced Audit Policies for better registry tracking.\n- Enabling Network Profile Tracking for more detailed network activity logging.\n- Enabling Process Creation and Image Load audit policies for better process-related logging."}
