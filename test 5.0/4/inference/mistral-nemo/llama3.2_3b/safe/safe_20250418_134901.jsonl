The `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file could be a temporary file created during installation or upgrade.\n- The `svchost.exe` event could indicate that Winlogbeat is being configured as a service, allowing it to run automatically when the system boots.\n- If you're seeing these events repeatedly or at unexpected times, it might suggest that there's an issue with Winlogbeat's configuration or behavior. You may want to review your configuration files and ensure they are set up correctly.\n\nTo troubleshoot further, you could:\n\n- Check if there's a corresponding `.winlogbeat.yml` file alongside the `.new` version.\n- Verify that Winlogbeat is running as expected and not causing any unexpected behaviors.\n- Monitor system logs for any related errors or warnings."}
