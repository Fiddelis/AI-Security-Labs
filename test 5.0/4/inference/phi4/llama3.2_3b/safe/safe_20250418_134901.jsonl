{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"The logs you provided are from Windows Event Logs, specifically related to Sysmon and Winlogbeat activities. Here's a brief analysis of each event:\n\n1. **Process Creation - winlogbeat.exe**:\n   - **Source**: Sysmon (ID 3) and Winlogbeat.\n   - **Details**: The process `winlogbeat.exe` was created, which is part of the Winlogbeat application. This software collects log data from Windows systems for further analysis or forwarding to a centralized logging system like Elasticsearch.\n\n2. **File Creation**:\n   - **Source**: Sysmon (ID 11).\n   - **Details**: A file named `.winlogbeat.yml.new` was created in the directory `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data`. This suggests a configuration change or update for Winlogbeat, as new config files are often generated during setup or modification.\n\n3. **Registry Value Set - svchost.exe**:\n   - **Source**: Sysmon (ID 12).\n   - **Details**: The `svchost.exe` process modified a registry value. This is common for system processes that need to update configuration settings. Monitoring such changes helps track potential unauthorized modifications or malware activities.\n\n### General Observations:\n\n- **Winlogbeat** and **Sysmon** are both part of a security monitoring setup, with Winlogbeat forwarding logs (possibly collected by Sysmon) to another platform.\n- **svchost.exe** is a legitimate Windows process often used for hosting multiple Windows services. Changes in its registry values should be monitored closely as they might indicate configuration updates or potentially malicious activities.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- Ensure that all software, including Winlogbeat and any other security tools, are up-to-date to protect against known vulnerabilities.\n- Regularly review Sysmon logs to detect unauthorized changes or suspicious activities on the system.\n- Maintain a baseline of normal registry modifications for `svchost.exe` and compare it with current activity to identify anomalies.\n\nIf you suspect malicious activity or need further analysis, consider consulting with IT security professionals."}
