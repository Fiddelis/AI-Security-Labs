The use of powershell.exe for process access and file creation also raises concerns about script-based automation or lateral movement. Additionally, the scheduling tasks via cmd.exe to run calc.exe on startup and logon are atypical behaviors that could suggest attempts at privilege escalation or maintaining persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
