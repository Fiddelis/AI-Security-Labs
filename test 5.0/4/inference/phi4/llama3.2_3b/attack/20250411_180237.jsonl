PowerShell is often used for legitimate purposes but can also be exploited for malicious activities such as script execution or system reconnaissance (e.g., whoami.exe). The repeated access and creation events involving files like .winlogbeat.yml.new might indicate attempts to modify or manipulate logging configurations. These patterns combined warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
