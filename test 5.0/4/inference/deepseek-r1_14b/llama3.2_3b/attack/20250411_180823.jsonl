Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first log shows chrome.exe with a network connection. That's normal because browsers connect to the internet.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessed something. Powershell can be malicious, but alone it's just accessing processes, which isn't suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Calculator usually doesn't load such modules, so that might be a red flag, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the fourth event, cmd.exe is running some commands to create scheduled tasks using schtasks. The command line includes creating tasks on logon and startup, which run calc.exe. This seems suspicious because why would you set up tasks for a calculator? It could be part of persistence mechanisms, like keeping malware active after reboots.\n\nFifth event: cmd.exe setting registry values. That's another point against it since malicious scripts often modify the registry to maintain access.\n\nThe sixth log is Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again. I'm not sure if this is normal for calc.exe. Maybe it's trying to do something more than just calculation.\n\nSeventh event has schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll, which seems normal because task scheduler uses that DLL.\n\nEighth and ninth entries are svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a legitimate process but can be used by malware. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nThe tenth event shows schtasks.exe creating another scheduled task pointing to calc.exe. This repetition suggests something might be off—why create multiple tasks for the same application?\n\nEleventh log: conhost.exe setting registry values. Conhost is a host process for console apps; again, not inherently bad, but combined with other events, it's worth noting.\n\nTwelfth and thirteenth entries are powershell.exe accessing processes again. I'm starting to think that maybe there are multiple instances of Powershell doing different things, which could indicate scripting or command execution.\n\nFourteenth event: chrome.exe creating a pipe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication but might also be a way to hide malicious activity. It's another point of interest.\n\nFifteenth and sixteenth entries again show chrome.exe modifying registry values. This repetition in registry changes from different processes is concerning. Why would Chrome make multiple such changes, especially when combined with other events?\n\nSeventeenth log: powershell.exe creating a file named unidade_ativo.txt. Creating files can be normal, but the naming and location might matter. If it's in Downloads, maybe not suspicious unless there's a reason to create that specific file.\n\nEighteenth event is another chrome.exe image load for amsi.dll. ASIIs trying to detect malicious scripts; perhaps Chrome is scanning something. Not sure if that's bad or just normal protection.\n\nNineteenth entry: whoami.exe running without any command line arguments. Whoami is often used to check user permissions and could be part of legitimate processes, but it can also be used by malware to gather info.\n\nPutting this all together, multiple cmd.exe instances creating scheduled tasks that run calc.exe, registry modifications from various processes (svchost, chrome), powershell accessing and modifying things, and the creation of a specific file. These patterns look like they could be part of an attack chain—using legitimate tools for malicious purposes, setting up persistence, and possibly downloading or executing malware.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because the combination of events suggests potential malicious activity rather than just normal usage.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show multiple suspicious activities including scheduled tasks created by cmd.exe and schtasks.exe pointing to calc.exe, repeated registry modifications, and powershell.exe actions. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms and possible payload execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
