I'm seeing a lot of PowerShell activity here. It starts with various ImageLoad events loading different DLLs related to .NET Framework. That might be normal for PowerShell scripts, but it's something to keep an eye on.\n\nThen there are some FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events. The file paths look temporary, which is common for script execution, but the fact that a file was created and then immediately deleted could indicate something malicious trying to cover its tracks.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple RegistryEvent tasks. Modifying the registry can be part of legitimate operations, but again, if it's done in a way that's not typical or combined with other actions, it might be suspicious.\n\nI notice that some processes have command lines that include \"& {}\" which seems unusual and possibly trying to obfuscate what's being executed. Also, there's a call to whoami.exe from PowerShell, which could be used to check user permissions or for lateral movement.\n\nThe last event shows a ProcessCreate with a specific command line that deletes a .zip file in the TEMP directory.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the provided batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a PowerShell process with a command line that downloads a file from GitHub. That's a red flag because downloading files from external sources can be malicious, especially if it's part of a script execution.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is accessing or creating files, like the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive and entrada_base.txt. These might be related to persistence mechanisms or setting up something on the system.\n\nThere's also activity with schtasks.exe deleting a task named 'spawn'. Task scheduling can be used for persistence, so deleting a task might indicate an attempt to remove traces or disrupt normal operations.\n\nI see several registry accesses and modifications by svchost.exe, cmd.exe, and others. Registry changes are common in malicious activities to create persistence points or modify system configurations.\n\nMultiple processes like whoami.exe and cmd.exe being spawned with specific commands could be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts. The use of SCHTASKS to delete a task suggests the attacker might be trying to remove evidence or stop scheduled malicious activities.\n\nThe repetitive nature of these events, especially multiple PowerShell instances and registry modifications, indicates possible automated or script-based attacks. This kind of activity is often seen in malware attempting to establish persistence and execute malicious commands.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there's a pattern that suggests potential malicious behavior, such as downloading files from external sources, modifying system configurations, deleting scheduled tasks, and using tools like whoami and SCHTASKS for command execution. These activities are indicative of an attack, so the batch is definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell downloading files from external sources, potential persistence mechanisms with task scheduler and registry modifications, and deletion of scheduled tasks.

I'm given a bunch of JSONL logs, each representing an event. My job is to analyze all these together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, looking at the process field, I notice that 'powershell.exe' appears multiple times with various command lines. Some have command_line as empty or '& {}', which might be obfuscation techniques. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate use and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag.\n\nNext, the winlog tasks include things like Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created, etc. The 'RegistryEvent' task stands out because attackers often modify registry settings to maintain persistence or hide their tracks. There are several entries where powershell.exe is accessing and modifying the registry, which might indicate an attempt to establish persistence.\n\nLooking at the file paths in some events, I see files like '.winlogbeat.yml.new' being created by 'winlogbeat.exe'. That seems legitimate, probably part of a log management tool. However, another event shows a PowerShell creating a temp script '__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1'. Temporary scripts can be used to test malicious code or bypass certain security policies, so that's concerning.\n\nAlso, there are several instances where processes like 'cmd.exe' and 'whoami.exe' are created without any command line parameters in some cases. The 'cmd.exe \/c' with an empty command might just be launching a new shell, but it's worth checking if this is part of a chain of commands or something malicious.\n\nConsidering the overall pattern: multiple powershell processes with varying command lines, registry modifications, file creation in temp directories, and other system interactions. These behaviors could be indicative of script testing, lateral movement, or persistence mechanisms typical in APTs or ransomware.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the combination of these events raises suspicion. The repeated use of powershell.exe with potentially obfuscated commands, along with registry and file system activities, suggests possible malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe processes with varying command lines, including potential obfuscation (e.g., '& {}'), alongside registry modifications and file creation in temporary directories.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze. My job is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting enough for further investigation or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the first two events, they're both from chrome.exe and mention network connections. That might be normal user activity if someone is browsing, but I'll keep an eye out for anything unusual with Chrome.\n\nThen, starting from the third event, things get more interesting. There are multiple instances of powershell.exe being executed with command lines that involve downloading files from GitHub repositories. The paths in the URLs look suspicious because they're pointing to different branches and components like \"modulo_temporario\" or \"estrutura_base\". This could be a sign of malicious activity since PowerShell is often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement.\n\nAdditionally, I notice several events where powershell.exe creates files in temporary directories. For example, one event shows a file being created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a random-looking name like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1\". Then, another event deletes that same file shortly after. This pattern—create and then delete—could be an attempt to avoid detection or clean up evidence after executing malicious code.\n\nThere are also multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved in downloading files from GitHub. Each command line seems similar but targets different files, like LICENSE.txt, which might not raise red flags on their own, but the volume of such events does. It's unusual for a user to download so many files using PowerShell unless it's part of an automated script or malicious activity.\n\nMoreover, some events mention tasks like \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\". These are generic Windows events and could be normal, but when combined with the other suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, they add to the concern.\n\nThe last few events show chrome.exe making changes to the registry. While Chrome can update registry settings during normal operation, multiple such events in a row might warrant closer inspection. Could this indicate some form of persistence or malicious configuration?\n\nPutting it all together, I see several red flags:\n1. Multiple powershell.exe processes downloading files from GitHub repositories, which could be part of a script trying to retrieve malicious payloads.\n2. Creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts, possibly to execute commands and then remove evidence.\n3. Several network connections from Chrome, though less concerning on their own but worth noting in the context of other events.\n\nConsidering these points, the batch shows behavior that is likely indicative of malicious activities. The combination of downloading files via PowerShell, handling temporary scripts, and potential registry modifications all point towards something not entirely legitimate. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes are observed attempting to download files from GitHub repositories, with some creating and subsequently deleting temporary files. This behavior, along with registry modifications by chrome.exe, suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are two events from winlogbeat.exe creating files in the same path. That seems normal since it's likely the service updating its configuration file.\n\nNext, several entries involve powershell.exe loading a DLL and accessing processes. Powershell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to be cautious here. The command line in one event tries to remove a file, which could indicate an attempt to cover tracks or modify the system state.\n\nThen, there are multiple instances of Registry value sets from chrome.exe and powershell.exe. While Chrome might be updating settings normally, repeated registry changes can sometimes be signs of malicious activity trying to persist on the system.\n\nI also notice several Process Create events for whoami.exe. This is a legitimate Windows tool used to display user information, but when executed in conjunction with other scripts or in an unusual context, it could signal privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nThe multiple FileCreate tasks by powershell.exe are creating files in specific paths like .txt files in the Downloads folder. If these are part of data exfiltration or configuration changes, they might be concerning.\n\nPutting this all together: there's a lot of activity involving powershell.exe and registry modifications, which could be indicators of malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms, file manipulation, or process injection. The repeated use of whoami.exe adds to the suspicion, possibly being used for reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\n\nWhile some events might look normal on their own, the combination—especially the PowerShell activity and multiple registry changes—is a red flag.

First, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first two events involve powershell.exe creating and then deleting a file in the Temp directory. This could be part of legitimate script execution or something malicious trying to clean up traces.\n\nNext, there are several entries where powershell.exe is removing files from the TEMP folder with specific paths ending in .zip and .txt. The use of multiple Remove-Item commands suggests some automated process, possibly a script. Malware often uses such techniques to delete evidence or perform actions like dropping malicious files.\n\nLooking at the command lines, they're using \"&\" which allows chaining commands in PowerShell. This is common but can be used to execute multiple malicious actions in one line.\n\nThere are also events where chrome.exe loads specific DLLs. While these could be legitimate system operations, sometimes attackers use trusted processes to hide their activities. The paths mentioned seem normal, so I'm not too concerned about these unless other indicators suggest otherwise.\n\nRegistry value sets by powershell.exe caught my attention. PowerShell is often used for persistence mechanisms in malware, where they set registry keys to ensure the malicious script runs on each startup. This could be a sign of persistent malware trying to maintain access.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe might not seem suspicious at first glance, but when combined with other events from powershell.exe, it raises the question: why is the system checking user permissions or credentials? Could this be part of privilege escalation?\n\nMultiple instances where powershell.exe creates and deletes files in the Temp directory, along with registry modifications, make me lean towards these being signs of malicious activity. The repetitive file deletions could be an attempt to remove logs or evidence of their presence.\n\nPutting it all together: unusual file operations by a scriptable process like PowerShell, combined with registry changes and other system interactions, are red flags in cybersecurity. These activities don't align with typical user behavior and could indicate the presence of malware attempting to maintain persistence, delete evidence, or perform malicious tasks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes deleting files from TEMP directory, including attempts to remove specific files using command-line arguments.
