The fact that multiple files are being created under a standard user's AppData directory isn't unusual; many applications use such locations for storing configuration or temporary data.\n\nThe file paths don't show any red flags like System32 or other protected areas, which are more common targets for malicious activities. Since all events are from the same process and follow a predictable naming convention, this doesn't indicate anything suspicious. It's just standard file creation as part of an Office feature update or installation.\n\nI'm also considering if there's any unusual volume in these events. There are 14 entries here, which might be more than typical but could still fall within normal operations depending on what the application is doing. If this were a one-time occurrence, it might warrant closer look, but since they're part of a package installation or update process, it's likely legitimate.\n\nSo, putting it all together: same process creating multiple files in a known user directory for an Office feature.

The key processes involved are \"SDXHelper.exe\", \"MdSched.exe\", and \"winlogbeat.exe\".\n\nStarting with \"SDXHelper.exe\": I notice there are multiple events where this process is creating files in specific locations. All these file creation events are under the same user directory, pointing to Office Solution Packages. The filenames look like JavaScript files related to Excel Copilot strings. This seems legitimate as it's part of Microsoft Office features or updates.\n\nNext, \"MdSched.exe\" appears twice. It's a known system process related to Windows Defender, responsible for scheduling tasks. Its command line is straightforward and doesn't indicate any unusual activity.\n\nThen there's an event from \"winlogbeat.exe\", which I recognize as part of the Elastic WinlogBeat agent used for log shipping.

From what I know, it's related to Microsoft Office, possibly handling updates or component management. So, creating files in these paths is part of its normal operation.\n\nThe file paths point to offline files for Excel Copilot strings and vendor resources like 'vendors~lazy...' which are likely static assets used by Office add-ins or web-based components.

So, each line is a JSON object representing an event on the system. The key pieces of information in each event are:\n\n- **Process**: The process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\" every time.\n- **Windows Log Task**: Each event reports that a file was created (rule: FileCreate).\n- **File Path**: All files are being created under the same directory structure within the user's AppData folder. Specifically, they're in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`. The filenames vary but follow a pattern like \"excel-copilot-strings_[some hex].js\".\n\nFirst, I'll consider what's normal. \"SDXHelper.exe\" sounds familiar; it might be related to some system utility or an Office add-in since the path includes Microsoft Office directories. Office applications sometimes create temporary or cache files in such locations.\n\nThe repeated creation of multiple JavaScript files under the same directory by the same process could indicate a few things:\n\n1. **Legitimate Activity**: If this is part of how Office, particularly features like Copilot, operates, it might be standard behavior. The system might be downloading and caching these strings for offline use or functionality.\n\n2. **Potential Malware**: However, multiple file creations in a short time could also be a sign of malicious activity. Sometimes, attackers use legitimate-sounding processes to hide their actions, so seeing many files being created quickly might warrant investigation.\n\n3. **Investigation Necessity**: The fact that all events are identical except for the filename suggests a pattern. If this is part of normal operations, it should be consistent across different users and systems. But if it's happening only in specific cases or under certain conditions, it could be suspicious.\n\nI also notice that each event reports a file creation without any associated deletion or modification events in the batch provided. This could mean that these files are either being created and then perhaps deleted after some time not covered by this log snippet, or they might persist indefinitely, which might not be concerning on its own but could be part of a larger pattern.\n\nAnother point is the naming convention of the files: all start with \"excel-copilot-strings_\" followed by varying hexadecimal strings. This seems systematic and possibly related to different language packs or regional settings for Copilot, as having localized string resources would make sense.\n\nHowever, considering that each file creation event is identical in structure and origin but varies only slightly in filename, it's possible this is part of a legitimate update or cache refresh process by Office software. Alternatively, if \"SDXHelper.exe\" isn't commonly known for such behavior, it might be worth looking into whether this process is authorized on the system.\n\nTo determine if this batch is interesting or not, I'd need to cross-reference with known patterns of Office-related activity and check if these file creations are part of expected behavior. If no evidence suggests that SDXHelper.exe should be creating multiple JavaScript files in that specific directory under normal circumstances, then this could be a red flag.\n\nMoreover, the repetition of identical events (same process name, same task type) with only the filename changing might indicate automated or script-driven activity. Depending on the context, such as whether the user is performing tasks that would require such file creations, it might be benign or it might be something more malicious trying to blend in.\n\nIn conclusion, while there isn't enough information to definitively classify this as malicious, the volume and specificity of the events are notable. It's worth investigating to confirm if this behavior aligns with expected Office operations or if it could indicate unauthorized access or file manipulation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by SDXHelper.exe targeting a specific directory, suggesting potential suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

The classification should be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nLooking at the provided JSONL data, each line represents an event where the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task is labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates that a file was created. Each event has a unique file path pointing to different .js files under the same directory structure.\n\nFirst, I'll consider what's normal in terms of system activity. Applications often create temporary or configuration files when they run, especially during operations like updates or initial setup. \"SDXHelper.exe\" seems to be part of Microsoft Office, as indicated by the path containing \"Microsoft\/Office\". Therefore, it's plausible that this process is creating several JavaScript files as part of its operation.\n\nNext, I notice that multiple identical events are present. For example, some file paths repeat, like the one ending with \"_6c878e617b5cdf6ec02250c4701fa7ea.js\" appears twice. This duplication might be due to retries or repeated actions by the process, which isn't unusual in some applications.\n\nI should also check if these file creations are part of known legitimate activities. Since they're under the Microsoft Office directory and named as \"strings.min\", it's likely that these files contain localized strings for the AI Copilot feature introduced in newer versions of Office. Such files are typically static and wouldn't be dynamically generated at runtime unless an update is being applied.\n\nConsidering indicators of malicious behavior, I don't see anything overtly suspicious here. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, strange file names, or activities outside the expected behavior of the application. The consistent process name and task type further support that these events are part of normal operations.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should think about potential red flags. For example, if \"SDXHelper.exe\" isn't a known legitimate process, or if the files being created were unexpected, that would raise concerns. But given my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I can confirm that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is associated with Microsoft's Office Suite and handles updates and package resources.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the frequency of these events. If an unusually high number of file creations occur within a short period, it might indicate something suspicious, like a script generating many files quickly. But here, while there are multiple events, they don't seem excessively numerous for such operations.\n\nI should also think about whether the file paths or names could be obfuscated or have malicious extensions, but in this case, all are .js files and part of an expected structure.\n\nIn conclusion, after analyzing each event and considering the context of a legitimate Microsoft Office process creating necessary resource files, I don't find sufficient evidence to classify this batch as interesting. The activities appear normal and aligned with the expected behavior of the application.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions by SDXHelper.exe, a legitimate Microsoft Office process, creating JavaScript files within expected directories.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each event is a JSON object with some information about processes and file creations. The process name in every case is \"SDXHelper.exe\". This process created several files in the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\". The filenames all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by different hashes.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this batch is relevant for investigation. Let me break down each part of the data.\n\nThe process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" stands out. I'm not immediately familiar with that specific executable, but Microsoft Office-related processes are common, so maybe it's a legitimate component. The fact that the same process is creating multiple files in the same directory suggests it's doing this as part of its normal operation. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under the \"OfflineFiles\" folder within a SolutionPackage. This makes me think these could be cached or downloaded resources for an Office add-in or feature. The filenames include hashes, which is common for versioning or ensuring the correct files are loaded.\n\nThe repetition of similar events with slight variations in filenames indicates that this might be part of a normal update or download process. Since all the events are from the same process and target a known Microsoft directory structure, it doesn't raise immediate red flags about malicious activity.\n\nI also consider whether such behavior is typical. Applications often cache files for performance reasons, so creating multiple small files isn't unusual. The use of different hash suffixes could be part of a version control system or to ensure that the correct file is used if there are multiple cached versions available.\n\nThere's no indication of any access to sensitive areas outside this directory, and no evidence of file deletions, modifications beyond creation, or other actions that might suggest tampering. The events seem isolated to file creation, which aligns with expected behavior for an application updating its resources.\n\nIn summary, while it's important to monitor for suspicious activities, the information here doesn't point towards malicious intent. It appears more like a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office functionality.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe under a standard Microsoft Office directory structure, indicating normal application behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The first thing I notice is that all these events are coming from the same process: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's interesting because it suggests there might be a single source for all these activities.\n\nLooking deeper, each event has a task labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means the system detected a file creation action. The files being created are located in paths under \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\\\\\" with different GUID-like folder names and specific filenames ending with .js.\n\nI recognize that \"AppData\" is a common directory for application data, so this isn't unusual on its own. However, the repetitive pattern of creating multiple JavaScript files caught my attention. The same process is creating several JS files with varying hashes in their filenames. This could indicate something normal like resource files being downloaded or cached by an application.\n\nBut wait, \"SDXHelper.exe\" might not be a commonly known process. I should check if this is a legitimate system process or part of software I know. If it's associated with Microsoft Office, which the path suggests, then perhaps these JS files are related to Office add-ins or Copilot features. The filenames include terms like \"officeaicopilot\" and \"word-copilot\", which makes me think they're part of AI assistant functionalities within Office.\n\nThe fact that multiple files are being created with different hashes could mean they're either cache entries, updates, or perhaps the process is distributing these files for some reason. But seeing the same event repeated multiple times might be a red flag. Malware often creates several files quickly, but in this case, it's under an Office-related directory.\n\nI should consider whether creating multiple JS files is typical behavior for \"SDXHelper.exe\". If it's part of legitimate software updating or initializing Copilot features, then these events are normal. However, if the process is unexpected and I have no knowledge of \"SDXHelper.exe\" performing such actions on this system, it could indicate unauthorized activity.\n\nBut looking at the structure of the file paths and the naming convention, especially the GUIDs in folder names, it seems organized. Legitimate software often uses GUIDs for package identification. The JS files might be static resources being placed into the cache.\n\nOn the other hand, if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a process I haven't seen before, or if these file operations are happening outside of expected times (like during system startup or user login), it could warrant further investigation. However, given that all events are consistent and follow a pattern typical for application data storage, it might just be normal behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities seem to fit standard software operations, especially related to Office features. The repetition is likely due to initializing or caching multiple resources rather than malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by a known Microsoft Office-related process for resource files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of log events to analyze. All the events are from the same process named \"SDXHelper.exe\". Each event is a file creation under Windows, specifically rule: FileCreate. The files being created are all JavaScript files in the path:\n\nC:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\[some guid]\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_[random].js\n\nHmm. First thought is that these look like legitimate file operations, perhaps from an Office add-in or similar software. The path structure seems normal for such applications. But why are there so many files being created? Let me count them... There are 14 events here.\n\nWait, each event has a different file path, but the base name is always \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by varying hash-like suffixes. This might indicate that multiple versions or chunks of the same resource are being downloaded or cached. Alternatively, it could be some form of logging where each operation creates a new file.\n\nNow, considering \"SDXHelper.exe\"—I'm not familiar with this process off the top of my head. A quick mental note: is SDXHelper known for anything malicious? I think it's possible that it's part of legitimate software, maybe related to Microsoft Office solutions or something similar. For example, in some cases, helper processes might create multiple files during setup or updates.\n\nThe file paths are within the user's AppData directory, which is standard for application data storage. The presence of \"OfflineFiles\" suggests these could be cached copies, perhaps used when online access isn't available. That aligns with typical Office behavior.\n\nLooking at the timestamps—though they aren't provided here—I would consider how close together these events occurred. If they were created rapidly in succession, it might indicate a bulk operation, which could be suspicious. But without time data, I can't say for sure.\n\nI should also think about the number of files being written. 14 might not seem excessive, but if this process is writing many more than usual or outside normal business hours, that could raise flags. However, in this case, since it's part of an expected operation (like updating JavaScript resources), it's likely normal.\n\nAnother angle: the naming convention of the files. The suffixes look random but might actually be version identifiers or unique per session. This doesn't immediately ring any bells as malicious activity; more like standard resource management.\n\nCould these events indicate a potential compromise, such as a file injection attack? The fact that it's creating multiple JS files could be a red flag if these files are unexpected or overly large. But again, given the path and process name, they seem to be part of an intended operation.\n\nI should also consider if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known in my threat intelligence. If I recall correctly, some legitimate tools and processes have this name, possibly related to system diagnostics or software updates. Without specific indicators of compromise (IoCs), it's hard to label these as malicious.\n\nLooking at the JSON structure: each event has consistent fields with \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" details. No anomalies in the log format that would suggest tampering or unusual activity beyond what's expected for file creation events.\n\nIn summary, while multiple file creations could be a sign of malicious behavior (like a loader dropping multiple components), the context here—the process name, path structure, and file types—points towards legitimate operations, likely related to Microsoft Office's solution packages. Unless there's additional evidence like unexpected access times or anomalies in file content, I wouldn't classify this batch as particularly suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are consistent with legitimate file creation activities by a known process, likely related to Microsoft Office's resource management.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The key details in each are the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\", the task being \"File created\" under Windows logging, and the file paths.\n\nFirst, I recognize that SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Office, specifically used for managing updates or settings. So it's a legitimate system process. The files being created are located in the \"PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\\" directory. The filenames look like JavaScript files with long hashes, which suggests they might be cached resources for features like Copilot in Word or AI services in Office.\n\nLooking at all these events together, I notice that each event is nearly identical except for the file paths and hashes. This repetition indicates that SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple files as part of its normal operation. Since all the operations are under this process and involve standard file creation tasks, there's no unusual activity here.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior like unauthorized access, writes to unexpected locations, or attempts to execute code.

Each line represents an event where the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\" and it's logging a file creation task under Windows. The files are being created in specific paths within the user's AppData Local Microsoft Office directory. \n\nFirst off, SDXHelper.exe doesn't ring any immediate bells as a malicious process to me. It sounds like something related to system diagnostics or maybe a legitimate tool. But I should double-check that. Maybe it's part of some Office add-on or update package.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under \"PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\" and have various .js file names with long GUID-like hashes in their filenames. This makes me think these are either JavaScript files for an Office add-in or maybe some cached resources. The repetition of similar filenames suggests that multiple versions or different parts of a package are being created.\n\nThe same event repeats multiple times—each one is the creation of a new file by SDXHelper.exe. There are 14 events in total, all following the same pattern. Since each event is about creating files, it's part of normal operations for an application that updates or installs additional resources.\n\nI should consider whether such file creations could be indicators of something malicious. Typically, malicious activities might involve files being created in unexpected locations, especially under user directories like AppData. But here, the location seems standard for Office-related packages and their resources.\n\nAnother angle is the frequency and number of events. If an application legitimately creates multiple files during its operation or update process, it's not unusual to see several file creation events. The fact that they're all from the same process and in a structured path makes me lean towards legitimate activity.\n\nI also notice that some of the filenames are variations of \"word-copilot.min\" and \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\", which might be related to Microsoft Office features, like Copilot or AI features. If these are part of an update or feature package, their creation would be expected during installation or configuration.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch doesn't exhibit signs of malicious behavior.
