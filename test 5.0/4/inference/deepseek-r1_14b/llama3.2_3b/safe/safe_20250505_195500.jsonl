Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that most of the events are coming from \"SDXHelper.exe\". This process is creating files in various locations, specifically under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The file paths all seem to be variations of officeaicopilot-strings.min with different hashes at the end. Each event is a \"File created\" task according to the winlog.\n\nI'm thinking about what SDXHelper.exe does. I recall that it's often related to software distribution and patch management, maybe part of Microsoft's System Center or similar tools. So, in an enterprise environment, this might be normal as part of deploying updates or packages. The repeated file creations could be the process setting up files for an Office add-in or some other solution package.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though they aren't provided here), if these events are happening over a short period and involve multiple identical files being created, it might indicate something suspicious like a script trying to write many files quickly. However, without more context on what's normal for this system, it's hard to say.\n\nThere's also an event from \"chrome.exe\" loading the BitsProxy.dll, which is part of Background Intelligent Transfer Service used by Windows for managing file downloads in the background. That seems benign and related to browser functionality.\n\nAnother event stands out: one where process is null, winlog task is \"Security Group Management\", and file is null. This could be an entry from a security-related operation, maybe group policy updates or user rights changes. However, since it's just one event among many, I don't have enough information to determine if this is unusual.\n\nConsidering the frequency of events: there are multiple entries with the same process name and similar file paths, which might suggest that the system is handling a lot of files quickly. If this is within expected bounds for SDXHelper.exe's normal operation, it's not concerning. But if it's an unusually high number or happening outside typical hours, it could be worth investigating.\n\nI'm also checking for any signs of malicious activity. The file paths don't seem to indicate anything immediately suspicious; they're within the user's local app data directory, which is where Office would store solution packages. Malware often writes to more volatile areas like temp folders or tries to execute files from unusual locations.\n\nThe fact that all these events are related to a single process creating files doesn't by itself raise red flags, unless there's an indication that SDXHelper.exe has been compromised. But given the information provided, I don't see evidence of that.\n\nIn summary, while multiple file creations can sometimes be indicative of malicious behavior, especially in certain contexts, here they seem to fit within normal operations for a legitimate process like SDXHelper.exe handling Office updates or package installations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of files by the SDXHelper.exe process, which is likely part of Microsoft Office's solution package management.

Each one is a JSON object in JSONL format, which means each line is its own JSON object. All these events seem to be generated by the same process: \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task in each event is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a file was created.\n\nThe paths of the files being created are all under the same directory structure:\n\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\\\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\\\PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_....js\"\n\nEach event has a slightly different filename suffix, like _8ebfe07f2f3572ae1923f187f9f5ac20.js and so on. It looks like multiple JavaScript files are being created in this OfflineFiles folder.\n\nSo, considering all these events together: the same process is creating several files with similar names but different hashes at the end. This pattern suggests that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is generating multiple JavaScript files as part of its operation. \n\nNow, is this normal behavior? Well, SDXHelper.exe might be a legitimate Windows process, possibly related to Microsoft Office or some other application that uses such helper processes. The creation of multiple JS files could be part of the application's setup or cache mechanism.\n\nBut why would there be so many identical-looking entries? Each event is a separate file create operation. If this were a malicious activity, I might expect more varied filenames or different patterns, perhaps files being created in unexpected locations or with executable extensions. Here, all are JS files under a known Microsoft directory structure.\n\nAlso, the fact that each file path is unique only in the suffix and follows a predictable naming convention suggests it's part of a legitimate process. Malware often tries to avoid such predictable patterns to blend in or exploit less secure areas.\n\nI don't see any indicators like access to sensitive files, network communications, or changes to system configurations that are typical red flags for malicious activities. These events strictly deal with file creation in an expected location.\n\nTherefore, while it's always good to monitor, this batch doesn't exhibit signs of malicious behavior.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, all the events are JSON objects, each representing a single log entry. Each line has the same structure: process name \"SDXHelper.exe\", the task as \"File created\" under winlog, and a file path that varies slightly but seems to be related to Office's OfflineFiles folder.\n\nLooking at the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\"—I'm not immediately familiar with this, so I should check if it's a known legitimate process. Maybe it's part of Microsoft Office or some support tool? If it's benign, then maybe these events are normal, but if it's malicious, that changes things.\n\nThe file paths all start with \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis...\" which seems like a standard user directory. The rest of the path goes into Office's SolutionPackages and OfflineFiles. This makes me think it's related to how Office handles offline content or cached files. So each event is creating a JavaScript file in this folder.\n\nNow, noticing that each event has a different file name but same base path. For example, the filenames have varying suffixes like \"bcde561ecb8a682661d626d5bf33668b.js\" and so on. This suggests that these are unique files being created, possibly as part of some installation or update process.\n\nSince each event is a file creation by SDXHelper.exe, I wonder if this process is legitimate for Office operations. If it's supposed to create multiple JavaScript files in this OfflineFiles directory, then seeing several such events might be normal during an update or when using Office offline features.\n\nBut why so many? Ten events creating different JS files—could that be excessive? Maybe the application is installing multiple language packs or resources. Alternatively, if SDXHelper.exe is a known malicious process, then these file creations could be part of its payload.\n\nI should consider whether \"SDXHelper.exe\" is commonly associated with Office. A quick search in my memory tells me it's related to Microsoft Diagnostics or perhaps some support tool. So maybe this is normal activity when the system is checking for updates or setting up something new.\n\nThe justification could be that creating multiple JS files in an OfflineFiles directory by a legitimate process like SDXHelper.exe might not be suspicious on its own, unless there are other indicators of compromise. Since all events look similar and come from the same source, without any signs of unusual file paths or access times, it's likely non-malicious.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because these appear to be legitimate file creation activities by a known Microsoft-related process during normal Office operations. My confidence in this classification is high, around 0.9, since the pattern matches expected behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe within the OfflineFiles directory appear to be legitimate Office-related activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each one is a JSON object from Windows logs, and they all seem to be similar. The process name in each event is \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task is \"File created\" with the rule being \"FileCreate\", which indicates that a file was created on the system.\n\nThe files are all located in a path under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages, specifically within an offline files directory. Each event has a different file path but they follow a similar pattern: officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by various hash-like strings. For example, \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_488766c3ec8a3da2ea076f8b310d4def.js\" and others.\n\nSo first, I need to analyze the entire batch as a whole. Let's see how many events there are here. Counting them, it looks like 15 separate file creation events all from the same process. This repetition stands out because usually, multiple file creations from the same process might indicate something is off, but it could also be legitimate.\n\nSDXHelper.exe – I'm not immediately familiar with this process. I should check what SDXHelper.exe does. A quick search tells me that \"SDXHelper\" is related to Office, possibly part of Microsoft's Office suite or some solution package. It might be a helper process for setting up offline files or syncing data.\n\nLooking at the file paths: they're all within the SolutionPackages directory under AppData. That area is typically where user-specific settings and data for applications are stored. The fact that these files are in \"OfflineFiles\" suggests they are being cached or stored locally, possibly for use when the system is offline.\n\nThe files themselves have names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min.js\". This seems to be JavaScript code, probably part of some web-based application, maybe related to AI copilots as indicated by \"ai\" in the name. Since these are .js files, they could be scripts used within Office applications or extensions.\n\nThe repetition of creating multiple such files might just be how the software initializes or updates its resources. However, 15 instances seem a bit high. Maybe it's part of an installation process, an update, or some background activity.\n\nI should also consider whether this kind of file creation is normal for SDXHelper.exe. If I see multiple identical or similar events in a short time frame from the same source, it could indicate unusual behavior. But given that these are different files each time, even though the process is the same, it's not immediately clear if that's malicious.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the file hashes (the parts after the underscore). Each one is unique and looks like a checksum or version identifier. Maybe these are being downloaded as part of an update process for offline functionality in Office. If so, this could be legitimate activity during setup or updates.\n\nHowever, sometimes attackers use legitimate processes to hide malicious activities. So I need to assess whether these file creations could indicate something more nefarious, like the dropping of multiple malicious scripts.\n\nConsidering that all events are from the same user (fiddelis), and all under their AppData, it's possible this is just normal application behavior. The files are being created in a directory expected for Office-related resources.\n\nI should also check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" has any known malicious associations. A quick search doesn't ring any immediate bells, but that could change. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nIn terms of indicators of compromise (IoCs), the file paths don't seem suspicious at first glance. They're standard for application data storage. The fact that they are .js files might raise some eyebrows because scripts can be malicious, but again, in this context, they could just be part of the AI Copilot features within Office.\n\nSo weighing all these factors: same process creating multiple files in a known legitimate directory, each with unique hashes and .js extensions. On one hand, it's possible that this is normal behavior for an update or feature initialization. On the other hand, the volume (15 events) might be higher than expected under normal circumstances.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's nothing overtly malicious in the description. However, I'd want to correlate this with more data, such as timestamps of these events—if they occurred over a short period, that could indicate something suspicious. Without knowing when these events happened or if there are other related events elsewhere in the logs, it's hard to be certain.\n\nTherefore, considering all factors, especially without evidence of unusual behavior beyond repeated file creation by an Office-related process, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\".\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events indicate multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe under a legitimate directory for Office resources.

This seems related to Office's functionality, possibly loading UI resources.

Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from both \"chrome.exe\" and \"SDXHelper.exe\". Chrome is a common browser, so some activity there isn't unusual. The tasks include Image loaded, Registry value set, and File operations like create or stream creation.\n\nLooking at the file paths for chrome.exe, one stands out: it's creating a file in the Downloads folder named \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\". It also has Zone.Identifier streams, which are typically associated with files downloaded from the internet. This might indicate that Chrome is handling a file that came from an external source, possibly untrusted.\n\nNow, looking at SDXHelper.exe, this process is creating multiple files in a specific path under Microsoft Office's Solution Packages. The filenames have long hashes and seem repetitive, which could suggest they're temporary or cache files. However, the frequency of these operations might be worth noting—there are several entries from SDXHelper.exe creating similar files.\n\nI should check if these activities are normal for these processes. Chrome often handles file downloads and creates streams to track their origins. The registry activity in chrome.exe might be standard for configuration or updates. As for SDXHelper.exe, it's likely related to Office add-ins or services that cache resources. But the sheer number of files created by SDXHelper could be a red flag if it's beyond what's expected.\n\nAnother point is whether these operations are happening during user activity or in the background. If this happened when the user was performing normal tasks, like browsing and using Office, it might not be suspicious. However, if these activities occurred outside of usual times or in an unusual volume, that could indicate something malicious.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility of data exfiltration or file injection. The repeated creation of files by SDXHelper.exe with varying hashes might be a pattern to watch. Could these be indicators of malicious scripts or modules being loaded?\n\nIn summary, while some activities are typical for these processes, the volume and specific operations (like multiple file creations and stream modifications) could warrant closer examination.

The path seems normal, but I'm wondering if SDXHelper is known for anything malicious. It sounds familiar; maybe it's part of some legitimate software, perhaps Microsoft Office related? \n\nThe second event repeats the same process as the first, so that's just another file creation from SDXHelper.exe. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nThird event: chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll from System32. That seems standard because urlmon is a known DLL for URL handling in Windows. No red flags here.\n\nFourth event: Excel.exe opening a file named Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. It's just launching a document, so nothing suspicious unless the filename itself raises questions, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nFifth event again from SDXHelper.exe creating another file in the same directory structure. Same pattern as before.\n\nSixth: Excel loading mscoree.dll, which is related to .NET framework. That's normal for many applications.\n\nSeventh: svchost.exe modifying a registry value. Svchost is a common process that can be both legitimate and part of malware, but in this case, it's just a registry event without any other indicators of malicious activity.\n\nEighth: A user account management log with no specific details. Could be anything from login to group policy changes; not enough info here.\n\nNinth: Excel loading coml2.dll again. Another standard system file, nothing unusual.\n\nTenth: Excel modifying another registry value. Again, without context on what's being changed, it's hard to say, but likely benign.\n\nEleventh and twelfth events are more file creations from SDXHelper.exe in the same pattern. It seems repetitive and possibly part of normal Office operations, like loading language resources or something similar.\n\nThirteenth to fifteenth: More Excel image loads for standard DLLs and additional file creations by SDXHelper.exe. The repetition makes me think it's part of a legitimate process rather than malicious activity.\n\nPutting this all together, I don't see any clear signs of malicious behavior. Most events are related to normal application operations—Excel opening files, Chrome loading modules, Office helper processes creating files, and standard system DLLs being loaded. There's no indication of unauthorized access, encryption attempts, or other hallmarks of an attack.\n\nThe only thing that could raise a slight concern is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe. However, without additional context about what these files contain or how they're used, it's hard to classify them as suspicious.

The process name is always \"SDXHelper.exe\", which I recognize as a legitimate Windows process related to Office. That makes sense because Microsoft uses it for things like language packs or updates.\n\nThe winlog task mentions that a file was created, specifically by the rule \"FileCreate\". So each event indicates that a new file was made on the system. The file paths are all pointing to locations within the \"OfflineFiles\" directory under AppData. These seem to be various language-specific strings files with different extensions like .js.\n\nLooking closer at the file paths, they're inside \"PackageResources\", which is typical for software packages installed locally. Each file has a unique name, such as \"en-us-ui-strings-json_...\" and so on. The repeated patterns in the file names suggest that these are localized resources for different languages, like English, Spanish, French, etc.\n\nI notice that some files are duplicated across events, like the \"es-es-ui-strings-json_34dc303006909da491f8dbd89618d1b7.js\" appears twice. This might be because the system is creating multiple copies or perhaps it's part of an update process where files are being overwritten or moved.\n\nConsidering all these, I don't see any immediate red flags. The process is legitimate, and creating files in typical locations for language resources doesn't raise concerns. It seems like standard Office-related activity, possibly during an update or language pack installation.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether repeated file creation events could indicate something malicious, but in this case, the nature of the files being created aligns with expected behavior from Microsoft's own processes.

That seems normal because Excel might be adjusting some settings, maybe during startup or when certain features are enabled. The fact that it's setting registry values isn't immediately suspicious to me; applications often do that for configuration purposes.\n\nThen, there's a series of events from \"SDXHelper.exe\". Each of these has the task as \"File created\" and points to various file paths under different language codes like ca-es, cs-cz, da-dk, etc. These look like they're creating files related to user interface strings for different languages. The paths are deep within Office's Solution Packages, which makes sense if SDXHelper is part of an Office add-in or some customization tool.\n\nBut wait, why so many files being created by SDXHelper.exe? It creates multiple files with similar names but different language codes. That seems like it could be related to localization files for the application. I'm not seeing any signs of these files being malicious in nature—no executable files being written, just string and JSON files which are typical for UI translations.\n\nI also check if there's any unusual process activity or if these file creations are happening outside expected patterns. The events don't show any other actions beyond file creation, so it doesn't look like they're executing code or accessing sensitive areas. Plus, the locations of the files are within standard user data directories, which isn't a red flag.\n\nAnother point to consider is that \"SDXHelper.exe\" might be part of Microsoft Office's setup or an update process. Sometimes during updates, new resources and language packs are downloaded and installed, which would involve creating these files. The repetition of similar file creation events could just be part of the installation routine for multiple language support.\n\nLooking at the overall batch, there's a mix of two Excel-related events and several SDXHelper events. Since none of them indicate unauthorized access or malicious behavior, it doesn't seem like this batch is trying to hide anything malicious. The justification is that these activities are typical for an application updating its resources or normal operation.\n\nI also think about whether the volume of file creations could be a sign of something wrong.

Maybe it's part of an update or cache refresh?\n\nThen there's an event from \"EXCEL.EXE\" with a DNS query. That seems normal because Excel would need to resolve domain names for things like online services or updates. But then, I see several events where EXCEL.EXE is setting registry values multiple times. Registry modifications can be concerning because they might indicate configuration changes, but in this case, since it's part of Office's operation, it's probably just normal activity.\n\nThere are also a few null entries, which don't provide much information. They might not be relevant to the overall picture.\n\nPutting it all together, these events seem to be part of standard operations for Microsoft Office—specifically, Excel doing its thing with DNS and registry, and SDXHelper.exe creating files in an expected location. I'm not seeing any signs of unusual activity like failed logins, unknown processes, or writes to unexpected locations. The repeated file creations by SDXHelper could be due to updates or package installations, which are normal.\n\nSo, my initial thought is that this batch isn't particularly interesting from a security standpoint. It's more about regular system behavior rather than anything malicious or suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be related to standard Microsoft Office operations, including file creation by SDXHelper.exe and normal Excel activities such as DNS queries and registry modifications.

They all come from the same process, SDXHelper.exe, and each event is a file creation task in Windows logs. The files being created are located in the OfflineFiles folder under a specific package path. \n\nHmm, the file paths end with various language codes like 'lt-lt', 'lv-lv', 'mi-nz', etc., which suggests these might be localization or regional resource files for an application. Since they're all created by the same process and are part of Microsoft Office's Solution Packages, it seems related to how Office handles different languages offline.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The consistent file creation by a known Microsoft-related process doesn't raise red flags. It looks more like normal operation during setup or update installation. There's no indication of unusual access times, multiple failed attempts, or deviations from baseline behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe related to Microsoft Office localization files, which is normal during setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
