{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine whether this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first event, it has a process command line that's using PowerShell to execute some commands. The exact command is `powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}`. Hmm, breaking this down, New-PSDrive is used in PowerShell to create a new drive mapping. Here, it's trying to map the G: drive to the target's C$ administrative share. The C$ is typically a hidden admin share on Windows systems, accessible by users with administrative privileges. This seems like it could be part of an attempt to gain access or move laterally within a network.\n\nThen, looking at the subsequent events, they all have `winlog` tasks labeled as \"Execute a Remote Command\". There are multiple such events—16 in total after the first one. Repeated attempts to execute remote commands could indicate persistence mechanisms or part of an attack chain where an attacker is trying different ways to maintain access.\n\nPutting this together, the batch starts with an attempt to map a drive using PowerShell to access another system's admin share and then follows up with multiple remote command executions. This sequence looks suspicious because it combines elements that are common in lateral movement during an attack—gaining access via shares and executing commands remotely. The repetition of remote command events might be part of an exploit or a script trying different ways to maintain persistence.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility that these could be legitimate activities, like system administration tasks, but given the combination of PowerShell with specific cmdlets often associated with penetration testing, it's more likely malicious. Additionally, the frequency of the remote command executions is high, which raises red flags.\n\nSo, overall, this batch seems to indicate potentially malicious activity, making it interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows a PowerShell command attempting to map a drive to an administrative share (C$) followed by multiple remote command executions. This indicates possible lateral movement or attack activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an event where svchost.exe sets a registry value. Svchost is a common process that can be malicious, but sometimes it's just normal. Not enough info yet.\n\nNext, sppsvc.exe creates a file in the cache directory. That seems legitimate since sppsvc is related to software protection.\n\nThen, powershell.exe accesses a process. PowerShell is a big red flag because it's often used by attackers for command execution and script running. I should pay attention here.\n\nWhoami.exe runs with a normal command line; that doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nBack to powershell.exe accessing another process. This repetition might indicate something fishy, especially if multiple events involve the same tool without clear justification.\n\nLooking further, there's a new PowerShell instance created with a specific command line: \"& {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\". Breaking this down, New-PSDrive is used to create a mapped drive. The parameters look like they're trying to map to a remote share \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\", which could be an attempt to access another system's C drive. This seems malicious because it suggests the attacker is trying to gain access to another machine.\n\nMultiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell and other DLLs are normal, but so many in one session might indicate script execution or loading modules.\n\nA file is created in a temporary directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1\". The name looks like it's trying to bypass certain security policies by using a naming convention that Windows might recognize as part of its own processes. Creating scripts in temp directories can be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThen, the same file is deleted shortly after creation. Deleting files after use is common for attackers to cover their tracks.\n\nThere's also a pipe created, which could be used for inter-process communication, often by malware to signal or exfiltrate data.\n\nLastly, more FileCreate and RegistryEvent tasks with powershell.exe—this repetition reinforces the idea that something is off.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell invocations with specific commands, file creation\/deletion in temp directories, registry changes, and attempts to access remote drives. These are all red flags indicating potential malicious activity. The attacker might be using PowerShell for command execution, creating persistence mechanisms, or attempting lateral movement within the network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with suspicious activities including registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in temp directories, and attempts to access remote drives, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed and accessed. That's a red flag because PowerShell is commonly used for malicious activities due to its powerful scripting capabilities. The fact that it's appearing so frequently in the logs suggests potential suspicious activity.\n\nLooking closer, there's an event where powershell.exe is run with a command line that includes downloading a script from a GitHub repository (https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn...). That URL seems suspicious. The domain 'S3cur3Th1sSh1t' isn't one I recognize, and the path to the script could indicate it's malicious or part of a known exploit.\n\nAdditionally, there are several ImageLoad events related to mscoree.dll and other .NET framework components being loaded by powershell.exe. This might be normal for PowerShell execution, but combined with the file download and deletion activities, it raises concerns about the script's intentions.\n\nAnother point is the creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_0wo2rwkr.dxh.ps1). The fact that this file is created and then deleted quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection or persistence. Malware often uses such techniques to clean up after itself or to evade scrutiny.\n\nFurthermore, the use of 'iex' in the command line stands out because it's a common PowerShell command used for executing code directly, which aligns with how malicious scripts are typically run. The script is also executed non-interactively and in a console output mode, which might be an attempt to avoid user interaction or leave fewer traces.\n\nI'm also noticing that after downloading the script, there are multiple registry value sets and file operations. These activities could be part of establishing persistence or modifying system configurations for malicious purposes. The fact that these events occur in sequence makes me more confident that this isn't just normal script execution.\n\nLastly, there's a process creation event for whoami.exe, which might seem benign, but when combined with the other suspicious powershell.exe activities, it could be part of an attempt to gather system information or privileges. The overall pattern suggests a possible attack chain where initial access is followed by lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting all these together—the repeated use of PowerShell, downloading external scripts from potentially malicious sources, file creation\/deletion cycles, and registry modifications—it's clear that this batch shows signs of potentially malicious behavior. Therefore, it's definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe including downloading a script from an untrusted source, creating and deleting temporary files, and registry modifications indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event with some details about processes, Windows logs, and files.\n\nFirst, I notice that the first event has all null values except for \"winlog\" which says 'task' is None. Not too informative on its own, but then the next events start showing a pattern. The command lines are repeating the same PowerShell script execution. They're downloading something from GitHub using powershell.exe and executing it.\n\nWait, the URL points to a specific commit of WinPwn.ps1. I remember that WinPwn is known for being used in attacks, especially since it's associated with \"S3cur3Th1sSh1t\" on GitHub. So this script is likely malicious because it's part of known attack tools.\n\nLooking at the command line details: they're using new-object net.webclient to download a script and then executing it. That's a common technique in malware to avoid detection by not writing files directly but instead running scripts in memory. Also, the parameters include \"-noninteractive -consoleoutput\" which suggests it's designed to run without user interaction, typical of automated attacks.\n\nAnother thing I see is that these events occur multiple times—there are several entries with almost identical command lines and similar Windows log tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. This repetition might indicate an attempt to establish persistence or lateral movement within the network. Each event could be from a different process or possibly the same one being executed multiple times.\n\nAlso, towards the end of the events, there are some that use New-PSDrive to map a drive. That's another PowerShell cmdlet often used in attacks for accessing remote systems or lateral movement. Mapping a C$ drive usually targets administrative shares, which could be an attempt to gain access to other machines on the network.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of downloading and executing known malicious scripts, repeated attempts with similar commands, and additional activities that suggest network exploration or persistence. This combination indicates potential malicious behavior rather than normal system activity. The fact that these events are spread across several log entries increases my confidence that this batch is indeed suspicious.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of false positives. Could these be legitimate scripts? Well, using powershell.exe to download and execute scripts from a known malicious repository like GitHub for \"WinPwn\" isn't something you'd expect in normal operations. Plus, the repeated pattern across events makes it more likely that this is an attack.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because there's clear evidence of potential malicious activity based on the repeated use of known attack scripts and additional indicators like drive mapping.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show execution of a PowerShell script from a known malicious repository (WinPwn), indicating potential hostile activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
