{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I've been given three JSONL events, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event has a process named 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is often used by administrators but can also be a vector for attacks. The Windows log task here says it was accessed under the ProcessAccess rule. That could mean something like an attempt to access or modify a process, which might be suspicious if done unexpectedly.\n\nThe second event involves 'whoami.exe', another common tool used to find out user information. Here, the command line is straightforward—it's just running whoami without any arguments. The Windows log task here is ProcessCreate, meaning it's tracking when a new process starts. This in itself isn't necessarily suspicious unless there are multiple such events or other context suggesting malicious activity.\n\nThe third event again shows 'powershell.exe' being accessed, similar to the first one. So we have two instances of PowerShell being accessed.\n\nPutting them together, I notice that both PowerShell and whoami are legitimate tools but can be used maliciously. The batch shows multiple accesses to PowerShell and a process creation for whoami. While individually these might not raise red flags, having both in quick succession could indicate an attack vector—like someone trying to gather information about the system (using whoami) and then perhaps executing commands with PowerShell.\n\nI should also consider if there's any pattern or timing that makes this batch suspicious. For example, multiple powershell.exe accesses without corresponding legitimate use might be a sign of malicious activity. Additionally, using whoami.exe could be part of an attacker's process to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps showing how close these events occurred or other related events (like failed logins, file access anomalies), it's hard to say definitively. But given that both tools are involved and there are multiple PowerShell accesses, this batch does seem notable enough for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and whoami.exe being executed, which could indicate potential malicious activity such as system information gathering or command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe created a file. That sounds normal because it's part of the logging process itself. Next, RuntimeBroker.exe set a registry value. I know that Runtime Broker is related to user accounts and permissions, so this might be standard activity.\n\nNotepad setting a registry value—again, not unusual if it's interacting with system settings. Then PowerShell accessed a process. I'm a bit cautious here because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, but accessing a process could be legitimate too. I'll keep an eye out for more PowerShell events.\n\nCalc.exe loaded urlmon.dll. Urlmon is part of Windows for handling URLs, so that's normal. Svchost.exe, which is a common system process, set some registry values—nothing suspicious there.\n\nI see multiple instances where svchost.exe and other processes like ApplicationFrameHost are setting registry values. These could be routine operations, especially since svchost is often used by various services.\n\nAnother winlogbeat event creating a file again. I'm thinking it's updating its log files as part of normal operation.\n\nCalculator.exe setting a registry value—again, if Calculator has legitimate reasons to interact with the registry, this might not be an issue. Then another PowerShell event, which makes me think about whether there are multiple such events that could indicate something more.\n\nLooking further down, Chrome is involved in several events: pipe created and multiple registry sets. Also, Chrome loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll—those are legitimate DLLs related to anti-malware scans. So no red flags here from Chrome's activity.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these events are standard system operations. Processes like winlogbeat, RuntimeBroker, notepad, calculator, svchost, ApplicationFrameHost, and chrome are performing tasks that fit within their normal behaviors. The presence of multiple registry writes might seem concerning, but they're common for various applications to adjust settings.\n\nThe only slightly worrying point is the two instances of PowerShell accessing processes. But without additional indicators like unusual process names or network activity, it's hard to say. However, since all other events are benign and there's no clear pattern of malicious behavior across the batch, I would classify this as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes performing standard operations such as file creation, registry value changes, and loading system libraries. No signs of malicious activity are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through each one step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event is MpDefenderCoreService.exe with a network connection detected. That seems normal because it's part of the antivirus or Windows Defender suite, monitoring network activities.\n\nNext, multiple chrome.exe entries show network connections and DNS queries. Chrome often does this when browsing, so nothing suspicious here unless there are unusual domains, but I don't see any indicators of that.\n\nThen, powershell.exe shows up with process access and registry events. PowerShell is commonly used for system administration but can also be a vector for attacks. The fact that it's accessing processes and modifying the registry could be concerning, especially if these actions aren't part of normal operations.\n\nThere are a couple of whoami.exe executions. This tool is usually used to check user information and permissions. While legitimate in many cases, repeated use might indicate someone probing system access levels.\n\nLooking at cmd.exe instances with commands like \"dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key\" suggests someone is searching for files ending with .key, which could be sensitive keys or configuration files. The command-line arguments are trying to find such files and then using findstr to look for lines ending with \".key\", which might be extracting information.\n\nI also notice that powershell.exe is being used multiple times with different tasks—accessing processes, modifying the registry, creating files. This could be a sign of script execution or automated tasks, but without knowing the context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nThere are entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is an agent used for forwarding logs, so this seems benign unless there's something unusual about the file paths or permissions being set.\n\nAnother powershell.exe creates a file named tarefa_geral.txt. Depending on what's inside, this could be storing data, but without content analysis, it's hard to assess. However, creating files with PowerShell can be part of malicious activities like setting up persistence mechanisms or storing stolen information.\n\nCmd.exe and conhost.exe also show registry modifications. Registry changes are common during software installations or system configurations, but frequent writes without clear justification might indicate tampering.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple processes accessing the network, modifying the registry, searching for specific files—these activities could be part of a broader attack. The use of tools like PowerShell and cmd.exe with non-standard commands raises suspicion. There's a pattern suggesting data collection (looking for .key files) and potential persistence or lateral movement techniques.\n\nWhile I can't confirm without more context, the combination of these events suggests possible malicious activity. My confidence is moderate because there are red flags but also legitimate uses for some of these tools.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including PowerShell and cmd.exe executing commands that may indicate data collection or system modification, along with network connections from Chrome and MpDefenderCoreService.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
