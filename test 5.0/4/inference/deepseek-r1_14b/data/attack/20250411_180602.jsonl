{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180602.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nStarting from the first few events, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe and whoami.exe processes being created. That's normal because admins often use these tools, but it's also common for malicious actors. Then there are cmd.exe commands that look suspicious. For example, one command is \"\/c attrib.exe +h %temp%\\\\estrutura_padrao.txt\". The \"+h\" makes a file hidden, which could be part of hiding files.\n\nLooking further, I see Registry value sets happening in various processes like svchost.exe and cmd.exe. This is concerning because attackers often modify the registry to hide their presence or alter system configurations.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a .yml file. That's probably legitimate since it's related to log management, but I'm not entirely sure if this could be something else.\n\nThe Calculator.exe accessing the registry seems odd because it's such a common program; unusual activity here might indicate it's been compromised or used as part of an attack chain.\n\nMultiple RegistryEvent tasks across different processes like chrome.exe and others stand out. Typically, legitimate applications don't modify the registry this much, especially in quick succession. This could be a sign of malicious activity trying to leave traces or alter system settings for persistence.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell and cmd with suspicious commands, hidden files, Registry modifications across various processes, and other red flags suggest potential malicious behavior. The combination makes the batch interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including use of PowerShell, cmd with hidden file operations, and excessive Registry modifications across various processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180602.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not. Let's see what we have here.\n\nLooking through each event:\n\n1. The first event involves chrome.exe loading amsi.dll, which is part of Windows' Anti-Malware Scan Interface. That seems normal for system files.\n2. Next, chrome.exe loads MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Again, this is expected as part of the antivirus functionality.\n3. Then there are multiple events where chrome.exe sets registry values. Doing some quick research, I know that legitimate software often writes to the registry, especially during updates or configuration changes. However, too many such events could be suspicious if they're all happening around the same time and from the same process, but in isolation, it's hard to say.\n4. There's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a tool for collecting Windows logs, so this seems benign.\n5. Powershell.exe creating a file called pacote_base.txt could be concerning because powershell is often used by attackers. Creating files can be part of malicious activities, but it's also used in legitimate scripts.\n6. The next several events are all chrome.exe setting registry values again, which stands out because there are 12 such events. That seems excessive for normal operation and might indicate some form of persistence or configuration changes that could be malicious.\n7. Then, powershell.exe accessing a process. This adds to the concern since powershell is known for being used in attacks, and accessing processes can be part of privilege escalation.\n8. Finally, whoami.exe is run from the command line without any arguments, which might seem innocent, but it's often used by attackers to check permissions or user information.\n\nPutting this all together: The batch includes multiple events from chrome.exe making registry changes, powershell.exe creating and accessing files, and using whoami.exe. These activities could be signs of malicious behavior, especially the concentration of registry writes from a browser process which is unusual. However, without more context, it's hard to confirm, but the combination does raise flags.\n\nSo, I think this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including excessive registry writes by chrome.exe, powershell.exe file operations, and whoami.exe execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
