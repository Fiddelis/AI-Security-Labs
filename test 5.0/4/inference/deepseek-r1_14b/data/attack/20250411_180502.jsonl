{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. These seem normal because Chrome often makes DNS queries and network connections as part of its operation. No red flags here.\n\nThen I notice events involving powershell.exe. The first few show Registry value sets and Process Create events. Powershell can be used maliciously, so this catches my attention. There's a command line argument that starts another process with a batch file path. This could indicate script execution, which might be suspicious if the script is doing something unauthorized.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad tasks for various DLLs, which is standard when Powershell loads different components. However, I'm more concerned about the FileCreate and subsequent FileDeleteDetected events for a temporary .ps1 file. Creating and then deleting a script file might be an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving a trace.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Provider Lifecycle tasks linked to Powershell with complex command lines invoking batch files. These batch files could be executing commands or scripts that aren't visible in the logs, which is concerning because it could hide malicious activities.\n\nPutting this all together, the presence of Powershell creating and deleting temporary script files, combined with multiple process creations and registry modifications, suggests potential malicious behavior. The repeated use of Powershell to execute external batch files also raises suspicion as attackers often use such techniques to execute payloads.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious command lines and file operations, including creating and deleting temporary script files, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where different processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and winlogbeat.exe are performing tasks such as setting registry values or loading images.\n\nI notice that chrome.exe is involved in several Registry value sets. While Chrome does interact with the registry for various settings, a lot of these might be legitimate activity, especially if it's during an update or configuration change. But having so many RegistryEvent tasks from the same process could be suspicious if they're outside normal usage patterns.\n\nThen there are some ImageLoad events for chrome.exe, loading system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These seem like standard operations since these are known DLLs used by Windows processes for anti-malware scanning interface and Defender's platform components.\n\nLooking at svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization directory—svchost is a common process for services, so this might be normal unless it's accessing unusual locations or performing unexpected actions.\n\nThe powershell.exe entries are creating files in user directories. Powershell is often used by attackers because of its scripting capabilities, but legitimate use can vary widely. The filenames like componente_principal.txt and elemento_base.txt don't immediately raise red flags, but they could be part of malicious scripts.\n\nwinlogbeat.exe is creating a configuration file, which makes sense if it's an agent running to collect logs. The presence of .winlogbeat.yml.new suggests it's updating its config, which isn't unusual.\n\nPutting this all together, while individual events might look suspicious on their own, the combination doesn't necessarily point to malicious activity. There are legitimate processes like Chrome and svchost interacting with system resources as expected. However, the high number of RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe could be a red flag, but without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI'm leaning towards classification as INTERESTING because there are multiple instances that could indicate something abnormal, even if they aren't conclusive on their own. The confidence isn't too high because none of these actions are outright malicious, just potentially concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple Registry value set events from chrome.exe and file creation by powershell.exe could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm going to go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL data provided, there are multiple entries. Each line represents a different event from various processes. I'll start by noting down the key points from each event.\n\n1. **Event 1**: Powershell is being executed with a command line that starts another process for a .bat file. The task here is related to Provider Lifecycle.\n2. **Event 2**: Another Powershell process starting a different .bat file, same as above.\n3. **Event 3**: Powershell again, but this time the task is Engine Lifecycle.\n4. **Event 4**: ApplicationFrameHost.exe accessing something with Registry value set. Not sure what that's about yet.\n5. **Event 5**: Calculator.exe doing a Registry value set—seems odd because Calculator shouldn't be making registry changes.\n6. **Events 6-7**: Powershell is being accessed, both in terms of ProcessAccess and ImageLoad. Also, it's loading MpClient.dll which is related to Windows Defender. Not sure if that's a red flag yet.\n7. **Events 8-14**: Chrome.exe is making multiple Registry value sets. That seems excessive. Browsers usually interact with the registry for settings but doing so many writes might be suspicious.\n8. **Event 15**: Powershell starting another .bat file, similar to events 1 and 2.\n9. **Events 16-17**: More Powershell activity—image load of urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate Windows component, but combined with previous activities, it's something to note.\n10. **Event 18**: cmd.exe running a .bat script. The command line path seems long and includes \"..\", which could be trying to access parent directories. That might indicate file traversal, which can be risky.\n11. **Events 19-20**: Powershell accessing process and creating files in the StartupProfileData directory. Creating new files in user profiles might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n12. **Event 21**: conhost.exe also making a Registry change—conhost is typically for console windows, so unexpected registry activity could be malicious.\n\nNow, putting this all together: There are multiple instances where Powershell and cmd.exe are running scripts, which is common in both legitimate usage and attacks (since attackers often use these tools). The .bat files being executed from various paths might be part of a script execution chain. Also, the excessive Registry writes by Chrome.exe and other processes could indicate tampering or persistence.\n\nThe fact that Powershell is loading different DLLs and accessing registry values might be part of legitimate operations, but combined with executing multiple .bat scripts, it raises suspicion. Additionally, cmd.exe being used to run a script with \"..\" in the path suggests possible directory traversal, which is often used in attacks to bypass security measures.\n\nThe high number of Registry modifications could indicate an attempt to alter system configurations for persistence or to hide malicious activities. The use of multiple processes (Powershell, cmd.exe, conhost) and their interactions might be part of a larger campaign trying to stay undetected or spread across the system.\n\nConsidering all these points, it seems like there's a pattern of potentially malicious activities: script execution, Registry modifications, process access, and file creations in user directories. These are common indicators of attack (IOCs) that should be investigated.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Powershell executing .bat scripts, excessive Registry writes by Chrome.exe, and cmd.exe running a script with potential directory traversal. These indicate possible malicious activities such as persistence or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
