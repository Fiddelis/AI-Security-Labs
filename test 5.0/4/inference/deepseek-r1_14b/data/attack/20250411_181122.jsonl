{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's see... Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The first thing I notice is that most events are from chrome.exe doing various tasks like setting registry values and making DNS queries. Then there are some events from winlogbeat.exe creating files, which seems normal if it's part of the logging setup.\n\nWait, towards the end, there's a powershell.exe process creating a file called 'objeto_logico.txt'. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it created a new file could be suspicious, but without more context on what's in that file or other related events, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI also notice that there are multiple registry writes by chrome.exe. While Chrome does interact with the registry, multiple writes in a short period might warrant closer look, especially if they're not part of its usual update cycle.\n\nAdditionally, network connections detected from chrome.exe could be normal browsing activity, but without details on the destination IPs or URLs, it's hard to assess their benignity.\n\nPutting it all together: some events are routine, others like powershell creating a file might raise flags, and repeated registry writes could indicate something unusual. However, there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior in this batch alone.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events from chrome.exe performing registry modifications and network connections, as well as a powershell.exe creating a file.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst up is a process named powershell.exe with a command line that includes some search strings looking for \"pass\" in various file types like .xml, .doc, etc. That seems suspicious because PowerShell scripts are often used maliciously, especially when searching for sensitive information.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating a new configuration file—nothing unusual there since it's part of the log management setup.\n\nThen notepad.exe making a registry change—that's odd because Notepad typically doesn't interact with the registry. Maybe a legitimate action, but worth noting.\n\nAnother powershell.exe process accessing something—is this related to the first one? Possibly part of the same script or activity.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll—this is normal since many system processes load DLLs. No immediate red flags here.\n\nThere's another powershell.exe accessing MpClient.dll—it could be legitimate, but again, given the previous suspicious activities involving PowerShell, this might be part of a malicious chain.\n\nThe same command line as the first event comes up again, suggesting repeated or automated behavior—this repetition is concerning and points towards potential malicious activity.\n\nsvchost.exe making registry changes—benign or not? svchost is a legitimate process, but unauthorized registry modifications can indicate malware. But I need to consider if this is part of normal operations.\n\nfindstr.exe searching for \"pass\" in files—it's another tool looking for sensitive info, possibly aiding in data exfiltration.\n\nMultiple events show various processes accessing the registry or creating files—this could be part of a larger campaign to maintain persistence or spread across the system.\n\nLooking at all these together: multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts with suspicious commands, repeated searches for \"pass\" in sensitive file types, notepad.exe and svchost making registry changes. These behaviors don't seem like normal user activity. The repetition and combination of tools accessing sensitive areas suggest potential malicious intent—maybe data theft or installing backdoors.\n\nSo putting it all together, the batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including repeated PowerShell command execution attempting to search for sensitive information (passwords) in various file types and registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That seems normal because winlogbeat is likely the tool logging these events. Then there's a PowerShell process creating a file called estrutura_ativo.txt. I wonder why that file name sounds familiar—maybe it's related to some structure or activity log?\n\nNext, an event with all nulls. Not sure what that signifies, maybe a system event or just noise. Then winlogbeat again creating the same .winlogbeat.yml.new file. It must be part of its configuration process.\n\nAnother PowerShell event accessing a process. Accessing processes can be benign but sometimes used by malicious scripts to check for running services. Then whoami.exe is run, which could be used to get system information—common in recon or privilege escalation.\n\nMore PowerShell accesses and registry modifications. Registry changes are tricky; they can be part of legitimate operations but also part of persistence mechanisms. The cmd.exe command deletes scheduled tasks using schtasks. That's interesting because deleting tasks could indicate attempts to remove traces or disrupt normal operations.\n\nThere are multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying the registry, which is suspicious since svchost is often used by malware to hide processes under a legitimate name. Also, more schtasks.exe deletions and image loading events—repeated task deletions might be trying to cover tracks.\n\nConhost.exe modifying the registry again adds another layer. Powershell and cmd being used in sequence could indicate script execution. The repetition of these actions across multiple events suggests automation or a script running with specific steps, possibly malicious.\n\nSo putting it all together: there's a lot of activity involving PowerShell, cmd, schtasks, and registry changes. These activities—deleting tasks, accessing processes, modifying the registry—are red flags for potential malicious behavior. The repeated use of these tools and commands could indicate an attack, like persistence removal or credential dumping.\n\nI'm confident at around 0.8 that this batch is interesting because it shows signs of possible unauthorized system changes and suspicious process activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of PowerShell, cmd.exe, and schtasks.exe performing actions such as deleting scheduled tasks, accessing processes, and modifying the registry, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. The user has provided several JSONL entries, each representing an event. My task is to look at all these events together and decide whether this batch should be investigated.\n\nLet me start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems benign; it's a common system utility used to determine the current user or process permissions. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll keep it in mind as part of the overall activity.\n\nNext, there are multiple events related to powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be both legitimate and malicious. The events show various tasks: Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image loaded, File Create, File Delete, and Pipe Created. Let me parse these.\n\nThe third event again involves powershell.exe accessing something, which might be normal if it's running scripts or commands. However, the fourth event catches my attention because of the command line: it includes a findstr command searching for \"pass\" in various file types, like .xml, .doc, etc., and then using select-string to look for the pattern \"password\". This seems like a data-mining attempt—maybe trying to extract passwords or sensitive information from files.\n\nThe fifth event is another Process Access on powershell.exe. The sixth one sets a registry value, which could be part of persistence mechanisms in malware. Registry modifications are often used by attackers to maintain access across reboots.\n\nThen there are several Image Load events for different DLLs when running powershell.exe. That's normal if the script is loading necessary libraries, but it might also indicate that certain malicious modules are being loaded.\n\nThe next event creates a temporary PowerShell script file in the user's AppData directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1\". Creating temp files is common for scripts, but combined with the previous findstr command, it could be part of a larger payload delivery. Then, immediately after creating this file, it deletes it. That seems suspicious because deleting a file right after creation might indicate an attempt to avoid detection or remove evidence.\n\nThere are also multiple Provider Lifecycle events tied to powershell.exe. I'm not entirely sure what these entail without more context, but they could relate to how the script is interacting with system services or other components.\n\nAdditionally, some of the events have command lines that reference a findstr and select-string pattern looking for \"password\". This repeated activity suggests that the script is actively searching through various files to extract sensitive information, which is definitely concerning from a security standpoint.\n\nPutting this all together: The batch shows powershell.exe being used with commands designed to search for passwords in multiple file types. It creates a temporary script, runs it, and then deletes it, possibly to evade standard logging or detection mechanisms. There's also registry manipulation, which could be part of persistence strategies. While some of the events might seem normal on their own, the combination—especially the repeated password searches and the deletion of the temp file—is a red flag.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it exhibits several behaviors that are indicative of potential malicious activity. The confidence level is high (0.9) because multiple events together suggest data exfiltration or credential harvesting, which are hallmark signs of cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes show suspicious activities including registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, and attempts to search for sensitive information like passwords in various files.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm looking at a batch of system log events and need to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to spot any patterns or suspicious activities.\n\nThe first event involves cmd.exe running a command to delete notepad.exe using wmic. That's a bit concerning because deleting processes can be part of malicious activity. Then there are multiple events with powershell.exe accessing and modifying registry values, which is a red flag since PowerShell is often used for attacks, especially when combined with registry changes.\n\nLooking further, I see WMIC.exe being used to delete processes as well. WMIC is another tool that's commonly abused by attackers for remote command execution. The fact that it's loading various DLLs from system directories could be an attempt to hide malicious activities or load harmful components.\n\nThere are also instances where userdel commands are being executed via cmd and net.exe, which suggests someone is trying to delete user accounts. This could indicate an attacker attempting to remove traces of their access or disable accounts to maintain persistence.\n\nAdditionally, the repeated use of whoami.exe might be an attempt to gather information about the system's users or privileges. Combined with the other activities, this could be part of a reconnaissance phase before more malicious actions.\n\nThe events show a sequence where multiple tools are being used in succession: cmd, powershell, WMIC, net, etc. This chaining of commands is typical in attack scenarios to avoid detection and to escalate privileges.\n\nI also notice that several processes are accessing or modifying the registry. Registry modifications can be part of installing malware, creating persistence points, or altering system configurations to facilitate unauthorized access.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a coordinated sequence of actions that could indicate a potential breach. The use of multiple tools for process deletion, account manipulation, and system information gathering raises the suspicion that this activity isn't benign. While I can't be 100% certain without more context, the combination points towards malicious behavior.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" with a high confidence level because the activities display characteristics commonly associated with cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of process creation and deletion using tools like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and WMIC.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities and can execute commands. The fact that it appears so frequently could be a red flag, especially since some entries have command lines that look suspicious, like 'powershell.exe & {}' which doesn't seem like typical usage.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe accesses processes (ProcessAccess) and modifies the registry (RegistryEvent). Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or to alter system configurations maliciously. The deletion of files via cmd.exe, particularly targeting specific .exe files in the Temp directory, might indicate an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are file deletions logged, which could mean that something is being removed to avoid detection. The whoami.exe process running multiple times might be part of reconnaissance to gather system information.\n\nWhile some of these actions can be benign (like legitimate powershell usage), the volume and combination suggest potential malicious behavior. For instance, repeated ProcessCreate events for powershell and cmd.exe alongside file deletions and registry changes are common in attack patterns.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely certain because sometimes sysadmins or scripts perform such operations. But given the frequency and types of activities, especially the command lines appearing repetitive and possibly malformed (like 'powershell.exe & {}'), it's leaning towards suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity, including process access, registry modifications, and deletions of files in the Temp directory, suggest potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be a red flag because it's commonly abused in attacks. Then there are several events related to user account management and security group changes, which could indicate someone modifying permissions—maybe an attacker trying to elevate privileges or create backdoor accounts.\n\nNext, I see cmd.exe being used with commands like net user \/del \/domain. Deleting a user from the domain could be part of cleaning up traces after creating malicious accounts. There are multiple instances where different executables like net.exe and sc.exe are deleting services (like win32times). Deleting services might disrupt normal operations or remove evidence.\n\nLooking further, I notice repeated use of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry. Registry changes can be part of persistence mechanisms to keep malware active after a reboot. The whoami.exe command is straightforward but could be used for reconnaissance to check user permissions.\n\nThe events involving conhost.exe and services.exe also caught my attention. These might be part of legitimate system operations, but combined with other suspicious activities, they add up. There are multiple attempts to delete users and services across different command line tools, which seems coordinated rather than random.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a series of actions that could be signs of a malicious user trying to clean up their tracks or create persistence.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the given batch of logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe being accessed. Powershell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, but standalone accesses don't always indicate misuse. However, when combined with other actions like registry modifications, it might raise a flag.\n\nLooking at the logs, I notice several instances of svchost.exe modifying the registry. SvcHost is a legitimate Windows process, often used by services, so these events alone aren't suspicious unless they're part of an unusual pattern.\n\nThere are also events where whoami.exe is executed. This is commonly used to check user permissions and isn't inherently malicious, but frequent use could be worth looking into if it's not part of a standard workflow.\n\nOther normal processes like notepad.exe, calc.exe, and chrome.exe performing usual actions (like registry access or network connections) don't seem concerning on their own. The network activity from Chrome is typical for browsing.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the combination of powershell accesses with other potentially suspicious activities, such as registry modifications by svchost and Calculator. These together might indicate a possible script running in the background, perhaps attempting to escalate privileges or hide traces.\n\nAdditionally, the winlogbeat.exe creating a file could be part of log shipping, which is normal unless it's accessing unexpected files or behaving abnormally.\n\nOverall, while individual events aren't alarming, the repeated use of powershell and the presence of multiple registry modifications across different processes might suggest some level of malicious activity. However, without more context or evidence of direct indicators of compromise (like known bad file hashes or specific process behaviors), it's hard to be certain. The confidence isn't very high, so I'd classify this as not particularly interesting but worth a closer look if resources allow.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of normal system processes and activities such as process creations, registry modifications, file operations, network connections, and DNS queries.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from powershell.exe. That's already a red flag because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The initial events show ImageLoad tasks loading various DLLs like mscorlib.ni.dll and clrjit.dll. These are standard .NET framework components, so they might not be suspicious on their own. But I should keep an eye out.\n\nNext, there's a FileCreate event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1 in the Temp directory. That file name looks like it could be part of a PowerShell script test or maybe some kind of malicious payload. Then immediately after that, the same file is deleted. This back-and-forth between creating and deleting a file might indicate an attempt to avoid detection by leaving traces behind.\n\nAnother event shows a Pipe Created event from powershell.exe, which is used for inter-process communication. Malware often uses pipes to communicate with other processes or to maintain persistence. I'm not sure if this is normal behavior in this context, but it's worth noting.\n\nThere's also an Engine Lifecycle task, which might indicate that PowerShell is executing some scripts. The command line is given as 'powershell.exe & {}', which looks a bit odd. Typically, the command line would have specific script paths or commands, so this could be another sign of something being hidden or obfuscated.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Registry value set events from both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malware to run at startup. I should consider how frequent these events are—multiple writes might not be normal for standard operations.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe process being created a few times. Whoami is usually benign, used to check user information. But in combination with other suspicious activities from powershell.exe, it could be part of an attack chain where the attacker checks permissions or system details before acting.\n\nFinally, there are several ProcessAccess events for both powershell.exe and whoami.exe. This indicates that one process is accessing another, possibly trying to gain more privileges or inject code.\n\nPutting this all together, the pattern seems concerning. Powershell.exe is involved in creating, loading, and deleting files quickly, which could be an attempt to execute malicious scripts without leaving evidence. The pipe creation suggests communication between processes, maybe for command-and-control. Registry modifications could set up persistence, allowing malware to survive reboots. The use of whoami.exe might be part of information-gathering activities before a more serious attack.\n\nWhile not all these actions are inherently malicious on their own, the combination and frequency raise red flags. The batch as a whole shows behavior that could indicate an active threat, such as scripting execution with potential payload delivery, process communication, and persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch indicates potentially malicious activity involving powershell.exe creating and deleting files quickly, which could be a sign of obfuscation or payload delivery.
