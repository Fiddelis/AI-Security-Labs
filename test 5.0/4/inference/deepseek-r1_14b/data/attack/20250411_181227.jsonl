{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is chrome.exe and the task is a registry value set. Registry changes can be normal for applications but repeated ones might indicate something suspicious, especially if they happen in quick succession. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThen, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for collecting Windows logs, so this seems legitimate unless the path looks odd. The path given is valid and part of the standard installation directory, so probably nothing wrong here.\n\nNext, powershell.exe created a file named objeto_auxiliar.txt. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful. Creating a file could be part of malicious activities like downloading files or scripts. However, without seeing the content of this file, it's hard to tell if it's malicious. But the fact that it's using a generic name doesn't raise too many red flags.\n\nLooking at all these events together, there's a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious actions. The repeated registry writes from Chrome could be part of an update or extension activity, but they might also be trying to hide something. The creation of files by both winlogbeat and PowerShell could be normal admin tasks or indicators of compromise.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, I'm not entirely sure if these events are malicious without more context. Some signs point towards possible issues, especially with PowerShell, but others seem benign.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry writes by chrome.exe and file creation by powershell.exe could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with some command-line arguments. The commands are base64 encoded or similar, which often is a red flag because attackers might encode malicious scripts to avoid detection. Each event shows PowerShell creating scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe at logon, under the Administrators group with highest privileges. That's concerning because calc.exe is typically harmless, but running it with such high permissions could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.\n\nAlso, there are events where the task name seems random, like \"unidade_ativo\" and others, which doesn't follow a standard naming convention, suggesting they might be created by automated tools for persistence. The fact that multiple tasks are being registered in quick succession makes me think of potential scripting or automated attack activity.\n\nLooking at other logs, there are instances where PowerShell is accessing the registry (RegistryEvent) and processes are being accessed (ProcessAccess). These activities could be part of the malicious script's process to create tasks or modify system configurations. The ImageLoad events show that PowerShell is loading some .NET framework components, which might be normal, but combined with other suspicious actions, it raises the alarm.\n\nThere's also a Chrome.exe entry creating a pipe and accessing the registry. While Chrome itself isn't malicious, such activities could indicate some extension or script running within it that's behaving abnormally. However, given that most of the other events are PowerShell-related, I'm more focused on those as the main concern here.\n\nAnother point is that all these events have similar command-line arguments, just with different task names. This repetition suggests they might be part of a loop or script designed to create multiple persistence points. Attackers often use such methods to ensure their malicious activities continue even if one is removed.\n\nI'm considering the confidence level. Given the number of scheduled tasks being created by PowerShell, each attempting to execute calc.exe with high privileges, it's highly likely that this activity is malicious. The repetitive nature and unusual task names support this conclusion. However, without more context or evidence like network traffic or file changes, the confidence is strong but not absolute.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors together, I think this batch of logs definitely warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell creating scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at these JSONL entries and need to analyze them as a whole.\n\nFirst, I notice that many events involve powershell.exe. Powershell can be used for legitimate tasks but is also commonly abused by attackers. The first few events show Image Load tasks for various DLLs. That in itself isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other activities, it might raise flags.\n\nLooking further, there's a file creation and deletion of '__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1' by powershell.exe. Creating and then deleting files quickly could be a way to avoid detection, so that seems suspicious. The fact that the file is deleted right after it's created might indicate an attempt to leave no trace.\n\nNext, there's a process command line showing powershell.exe executing a script that creates a scheduled task. The action for this task is 'calc.exe', but the trigger is at logon, and it's set to run with highest privileges as part of the Administrators group. That seems odd because creating a persistent task with admin rights could be a way to maintain access or perform malicious activities once the user logs in.\n\nThen, there are multiple registry value sets by chrome.exe. While Chrome can make registry changes, doing so repeatedly and especially in bulk might indicate something amiss. However, without more context on what specific keys are being modified, it's harder to judge, but unusual activity here is notable.\n\nThe latter part of the logs shows several events where \"Execute a Remote Command\" is logged, but the process and file fields are null. This could imply remote execution attempts or command-line operations that don't involve local files, possibly indicating an attempt to run commands over a network, which is often malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe is being used to create a scheduled task with calc.exe as the action. While calc.exe itself isn't harmful, using it within a scheduled task under admin rights could be part of a larger attack vector. The file creation and deletion might be steps in a script meant to avoid detection. The remote command executions without associated files suggest potential lateral movement or remote attacks.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because the combination of powershell activity, file handling, registry modifications, and remote commands points towards possible malicious behavior. However, I'm not entirely certain if all these actions are definitively bad, as some could be legitimate system administration tasks. But given the volume and specific activities, my confidence is around 0.7 that this batch warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including Powershell script execution, file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and remote command executions, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". This usually indicates some sort of remote activity, which could be malicious. However, on its own, it might not always be suspicious because legitimate remote commands can happen, like in cloud environments or for administrative tasks.\n\nLooking further down, I see an event where the process command line has powershell.exe executing a scheduled task to run calc.exe at logon with admin privileges and highest run level. This stands out because creating a scheduled task that runs as admin and using powershell for such a task could be malicious. It's a common technique in attacks to escalate privileges or maintain persistence.\n\nThen, there are multiple events from svchost.exe modifying the registry. SvcHost is a legitimate process but often used by malware due to its reputation as a \"service host\" that can run various code. The fact that it's setting registry values could be part of creating or modifying malicious entries, which is another red flag.\n\nNext, there's an event where WmiPrvSE.exe loads taskschd.dll. WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is often targeted by attackers for remote command execution and persistence. This particular activity might be related to scheduling tasks via WMI, which could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation events like creating a scheduled task named 'unidade_comum' in the system32 folder. Creating new files or tasks with names that don't make immediate sense could indicate malicious activity attempting to establish persistence points.\n\nMoreover, powershell.exe is seen both executing commands and creating a file in a user's profile directory, which might be part of dropping scripts or configurations for later execution. The fact that it's also interacting with the registry adds to the suspicion.\n\nThere are other events from Chrome accessing various system files and registry keys, but these could be normal as browsers interact with system components for anti-malware checks (like AMSI). However, if combined with other suspicious activities, it might indicate an attempt to bypass such protections or persistence mechanisms.\n\nLastly, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a config file in the user's downloads folder. While this is more likely benign, especially if it's part of log management tools, it doesn't align with the malicious activities observed elsewhere but could be considered as part of data collection for exfiltration.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple remote command executions, suspicious powershell activity, svchost.exe modifying registry, WMI usage, creation of scheduled tasks with admin privileges, and other file creations. These collectively indicate a potential attack chain aiming to establish persistence, escalate privileges, or execute malicious commands. The combination of different process activities and multiple events overwriting or creating system files suggests coordinated malicious behavior rather than coincidental legitimate actions.\n\nTherefore, the batch is definitely interesting for further investigation as it shows signs of possible compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including remote command executions, PowerShell script execution creating a scheduled task with admin privileges, registry modifications by svchost.exe, and WMI usage. These indicate potential malicious behavior or attack chain.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
