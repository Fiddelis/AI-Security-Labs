{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving PowerShell executing commands that modify file last write times. This is suspicious because changing timestamps can hide malicious activity or data exfiltration. The repeated use of Get-ChildItem and setting LastWriteTime to a very old date (January 1, 1970) stands out as it's often used in attacks to avoid detection.\n\nNext, there are entries where svchost.exe is modifying registry values multiple times. While svchost is a legitimate process, frequent or unusual registry changes can indicate malicious activities like installing backdoors or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where conhost.exe writes to the registry. Conhost is typically related to command-line tools, but any unexpected registry activity from it should raise flags.\n\nThere are also some normal events, like calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which don't seem concerning on their own. However, combined with the other suspicious activities, they add context that might be relevant.\n\nThe event where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll is interesting because Windows Defender components shouldn't be loaded by PowerShell in a typical scenario unless something is amiss.\n\nLastly, winlogbeat.exe creating a new config file isn't inherently suspicious, but could be part of log tampering if it's modifying logs related to other activities.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows several red flags: multiple PowerShell commands altering files, registry modifications by svchost and conhost, and potential manipulation of system tools. These indicators collectively suggest possible malicious activity, making the batch highly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activities modifying file timestamps and registry values, combined with legitimate processes like svchost.exe showing unusual behavior, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by looking through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe with tasks related to DNS queries and network connections. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of DNS lookups and connects to various websites. Not suspicious on their own, especially since all these events are from the same process and don't show any unusual patterns beyond regular browsing activity.\n\nNext, I notice powershell.exe appearing multiple times with different tasks. The first time it's accessed, then creates a process, accesses again, and sets registry values. That caught my attention because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. However, looking at the command line in one of the events, there's a script that modifies file last write times. That could be an attempt to hide or alter file metadata, which might indicate something suspicious like data tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, there are several image load events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell as it uses .NET components. But combined with the script execution and file creation\/deletion in the Temp folder, this could be part of a larger script trying to avoid detection by modifying logs or files.\n\nThere's also an event where RuntimeBroker.exe sets a registry value. RuntimeBroker is related to Windows services and UWP apps, so that seems benign unless there's more context, which isn't provided here. Similarly, notepad.exe accessing the registry might be part of some legitimate operation, like writing configurations, but without knowing what it's doing exactly, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of PowerShell with a script modifying file timestamps and creating\/deleting files in the Temp directory is concerning. This could be an attempt at persistence or data exfiltration. While some activities are normal, the combination raises flags that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing registry operations and executing scripts with potential file manipulation activities indicate possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that several processes are involved here: ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and there's one without a process name. Each of these has different log tasks associated with them.\n\nStarting with the first few events:\n1. ApplicationFrameHost.exe is setting a registry value.\n2. Calculator.exe does the same.\n3. Powershell.exe also sets a registry value.\n4. Another powershell.exe event, but this time it's about process access.\n\nI know that legitimate software can sometimes modify registry values during normal operation, but I'm flagging this because multiple processes are doing this. It might be nothing, or it could be part of a malicious activity like installing a backdoor or persistence mechanism.\n\nNext, there's an event where chrome.exe creates a pipe. Creating named pipes can be a way for processes to communicate, but in some cases, malware uses pipes for command and control. However, I'm not sure if this is suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking further down, several chrome.exe instances are setting registry values repeatedly. That seems unusual because Chrome typically doesn't make many registry changes during normal browsing. This could indicate that something is trying to modify system configurations in a way that's not standard.\n\nThere's also an event where chrome.exe loads the amsi.dll file. AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) is used by Windows to detect malicious code, so this might be a red flag because attackers often try to bypass or disable such protections. But again, sometimes legitimate processes load these files for various reasons.\n\nAnother event involves loading MpOAV.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal since it's part of the defender software, but I'm curious about why Chrome would load this specific file unless there's something wrong with its process.\n\nThen, winlogbeat.exe creates a new config file and powershell.exe writes to a file named unidade_logico.txt in the downloads folder. The fact that powershell is writing files could be concerning because it's often used for scripting attacks. Creating a file named 'unidade_logico' doesn't ring any bells immediately, but sometimes attackers use such names for obfuscation.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple processes (chrome.exe especially) are making registry changes repeatedly, which could be an attempt to modify system settings or install malicious software. The involvement of powershell and the creation of files in user directories might indicate that something is trying to persist on the system or exfiltrate data.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these actions are malicious, but the combination raises some red flags. The high number of registry changes by different processes isn't typical for normal operations, and the use of powershell along with file creation could be part of a script meant to drop files or establish persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes (including Chrome.exe and PowerShell.exe) show repeated registry modifications and other potentially suspicious activities such as loading anti-malware components, file creation by non-standard processes, and unusual file writes. These patterns may indicate malicious behavior or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
