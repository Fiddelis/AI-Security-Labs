{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system events is interesting or not. Let's start by looking at what each event says.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe. I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that catches my attention. There's a command line in one of them that looks like it's creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with some binary path. That seems suspicious because creating services is a common way for malware to persist on a system.\n\nAlso, there are several events where powershell.exe accesses processes and registry values, which could indicate privilege escalation or trying to hide activities. The file operations like creating and then deleting a temp file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1) might be part of script execution or testing permissions. Malware often does this to check if scripts are allowed to run.\n\nLooking at the ImageLoad events for mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, and others, these are normal .NET framework components. But combined with other suspicious activities, it could mean that PowerShell is loading additional modules or libraries which might be malicious.\n\nThen there's services.exe setting registry values multiple times. Services.exe is a legitimate system process, but unusual activity here could indicate tampering with system services or configurations, possibly to enable persistence or modify service behavior.\n\nOverall, the combination of creating a new service via PowerShell, file operations in temp directories, multiple registry changes, and image loading activities makes me think this batch shows potential malicious behavior. The confidence is high because several red flags are present together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values, creating a new service, file operations in temp directories, and services.exe modifying registry entries suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are a lot of events where the process name is 'svchost.exe' and the task is 'Registry value set'. Svchost.exe is known as a legitimate Windows process, often associated with services in Windows. The fact that it's setting registry values isn't inherently suspicious on its own since many system processes do this regularly. However, multiple instances of this could be something to look into, but I don't have enough context here about what exactly was changed in the registry.\n\nThen there are several events from 'setup.exe' creating various files under the Microsoft Edge directory. Setup.exe is commonly used for software installations. The paths mentioned seem normal for an installation process—installing or updating Edge. Each file created (like msedge.exe, msedgewebview2.exe, etc.) looks like standard components of a web browser and its associated services.\n\nThere's also an event from 'RuntimeBroker.exe' setting a registry value. Runtime Broker is another legitimate Windows process involved in managing UWP applications, so this activity is expected.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where setup.exe loads taskschd.dll, which is part of the Task Scheduler. This is normal during software installations to schedule tasks or perform background operations.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like a lot of them are related to installing or updating Microsoft Edge and associated processes. While some may look suspicious at first glance (like multiple registry changes), without additional context indicating malicious behavior (such as unusual file paths, writes to restricted areas, or unexpected network activity), these events don't raise red flags.\n\nTherefore, while it's always good to monitor such activities, especially in a corporate environment, the information provided doesn't suggest any malicious intent. The confidence level is high because the actions described align with standard software installation and system processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to standard Microsoft Edge installation activities and legitimate Windows processes, showing no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst off, I notice a lot of events involving processes like svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe. Svchost.exe is known as a legitimate Windows process that hosts various services, so it's pretty common to see it in system logs. Similarly, services.exe is part of the Windows Services application, which manages system services, so that's also normal.\n\nLooking at the types of events, most are related to Registry changes—either setting values or adding\/deleting objects. This isn't unusual because many applications interact with the Windows Registry for configuration settings. The fact that these are happening multiple times from svchost.exe and services.exe doesn't immediately raise a red flag, especially since they're common system processes.\n\nThere's also an event where setup.exe is creating files in specific paths like C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\. These look like legitimate locations for Microsoft Edge components. The creation of .lnk files in the Start Menu and Quick Launch folders is typical during software installation or updates, so that seems normal too.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether these activities could be part of a malicious process. While svchost.exe and services.exe can sometimes be used by malware to hide their processes, the fact that they're only performing Registry operations doesn't indicate something suspicious on its own. Similarly, setup.exe creating files in standard locations is more likely related to software installation rather than malicious activity.\n\nI also note that there are a few Pipe Created events from setup.exe. While named pipes can be used for inter-process communication, this isn't inherently malicious unless it's part of a known exploit or paired with other suspicious activities, which aren't present here.\n\nIn summary, while the frequency and specific actions might seem concerning at first glance, they all fall within typical behavior for these system processes and software setup routines. There's no evidence of unusual file accesses, network connections, or other red flags that would suggest malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system process activities such as Registry modifications and legitimate file creations by known Windows processes like svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe.

The logs are in JSONL format, each with a process name, winlog task, and file info.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from 'setup.exe' performing registry operations—either setting values or creating\/deleting objects. These could be normal during setup processes, but repeated actions might indicate something suspicious, especially if they're writing to sensitive registry areas.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Pipe Created' events from 'setup.exe'. Creating pipes can be part of inter-process communication, but in some cases, attackers use named pipes for command and control or data exfiltration. The repetition here could warrant closer look.\n\nNext, I see several 'svchost.exe' entries creating files in the Windows Temp directory with unique names like APPX followed by random strings. These might be legitimate temporary files, especially since svchost is a common system process. However, multiple such files created quickly could suggest something malicious, like dropping payloads or creating temporary storage for malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the file paths, some are in C:\\Windows\\Temp and others in C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness. The AppReadiness folder is related to app deployment and might not be typical for svchost.exe unless it's part of a legitimate update process.\n\nPutting this together: multiple processes creating temporary files, registry modifications, and pipe creations could indicate malicious behavior such as installing software, setting persistence mechanisms, or establishing communication channels. However, since some activities are common in system updates or legitimate software installations, it's not entirely clear without more context.\n\nI'm a bit uncertain because these actions can be part of normal operations, but the volume and combination might raise flags. To be safe, I'll classify this as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of setup.exe performing registry modifications and creating pipes, along with svchost.exe creating numerous temporary files.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, looking at the events, I see a lot of Dism.exe processes and some PowerShell and cmd activities.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll, which sounds normal since Defender uses that. Next, cmd.exe running a command to disable Windows Defender features. That's a red flag because disabling antivirus can lower system security. Then there are multiple instances where Dism.exe is creating files in a temp directory and accessing various DLLs.\n\nI notice that the same temp path keeps appearing across different events, which suggests that these might be part of a malicious payload being unpacked or executed. The repeated FileExecutableDetected for so many files could indicate an adversary trying to execute multiple components.\n\nPutting it all together: disabling Defender, creating new files in a temp directory with names like AppxProvider.dll and DismCorePS.dll, which are unusual, might be part of installing something malicious.

Each event is in JSONL format, so each line represents a separate log entry.\n\nThe first thing that stands out is the repeated use of powershell.exe across many events. Powershell can be both legitimate and malicious, so it's important to analyze how it's being used here. In several entries, the command line for powershell.exe shows specific commands, like checking system files or executing scripts with certain parameters.\n\nLooking deeper, I see that some processes are loading various DLLs, such as MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, which might be related to antivirus software. However, the fact that these are being loaded by powershell could be suspicious if they're not expected in this context.\n\nThere's also an event where a script is being created in temporary directories (like __PSScriptPolicyTest_2bdqlimh.dpa.psm1 and __PSScriptPolicyTest_wf5ajhez.sfd.psm1). Temporary PowerShell scripts can be a red flag if they're created without clear justification, especially since they might be used to execute malicious commands.\n\nAnother point is the use of Process Create events for powershell.exe with specific command lines. The command shown in one event attempts to check for certain .inf files and their content, which could indicate reconnaissance or an attempt to alter system configuration files. This kind of activity might be part of a broader attack vector, such as privilege escalation or data exfiltration.\n\nThe repeated file creation events and pipe creations are also notable. While these actions can be legitimate, the combination with powershell.exe usage raises the suspicion that this could be part of a malicious script's execution flow, possibly setting up communication channels or creating persistence mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, the command line parameters like \"-ExecutionPolicy Restricted\" might be an attempt to limit detection by ensuring scripts don't run automatically, but they also can be used by attackers to bypass certain security measures. The use of Write-Host suggests that some output is being generated, which could indicate a test or information gathering phase.\n\nTaking all these points together—multiple powershell.exe instances with specific commands, creation of temporary script files, loading of DLLs, and command-line parameters—it seems like there's a pattern indicative of potentially malicious activity. While it's possible for legitimate scripts to perform such actions, the combination raises enough red flags to warrant closer investigation.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as interesting due to the concerning activities observed across multiple events involving powershell.exe.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity with potential malicious intent, including script creation and DLL loading.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are coming from svchost.exe. I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used by services, but it can sometimes be used maliciously because there are so many different services that use it as a host. So, any unusual activity from svchost.exe should raise an eyebrow.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they all mention \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" and the file paths seem to be under C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps and C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness. Those are standard directories for Windows apps and system-related files. However, I see that in each event, the same path is being logged multiple times. For example, EdgeGameAssist.exe is created once, but then there are several identical file paths under AppReadiness with different SIDs. This repetition could be normal if it's part of a legitimate process, like during Windows updates or service installations. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen, after the file creation events, there are multiple Registry value set tasks from svchost.exe. That caught my attention because modifying the registry can have significant effects on system behavior. Malware often uses registry modifications to maintain persistence or change system configurations. So, seeing several writes to the registry from svchost.exe could indicate something malicious.\n\nNext, I see an event where powershell.exe is created with a command line that runs Write-Host 'Final result: 1';. The ExecutionPolicy is set to Restricted, which means it's limiting what the script can do. But even so, PowerShell is often used by attackers for lateral movement or executing commands. The fact that it's being spawned and then loading various .NET libraries could be part of a legitimate process, but given the previous events, this might be part of a chain.\n\nNow, considering all these together: svchost.exe creating files in known directories, making registry changes, and then spawning powershell.exe with restricted execution. The multiple identical file creation events are suspicious because they could indicate an attempt to create the same file multiple times, possibly as a way to bypass detection or overwrite legitimate files.\n\nThe PowerShell command itself is minimal—it just writes 'Final result: 1' to the host. That's not very telling on its own, but combined with the svchost.exe activity, it might be part of a larger attack vector. Maybe thesvchost.exe process was setting up some configurations or persistence mechanisms via the registry and then using PowerShell for execution.\n\nI'm also thinking about how these events are sequential. The file creations, followed by registry modifications, then spawning PowerShell—it seems like a possible attack chain where an initial compromise (maybe through another vector) is setting up persistence and executing code.\n\nOn the other hand, it's possible that these are all legitimate system activities, especially since svchost.exe is commonly used for services. But given the number of repeated file creations and registry writes, plus the use of PowerShell in a restricted environment, it feels like there's more to this than normal system behavior.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think this batch shows potential malicious activity that could warrant further investigation. The combination of multiple file creations from svchost.exe, registry modifications, and the specific PowerShell command might be indicative of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events from svchost.exe targeting known directories, followed by registry modifications and a restricted PowerShell execution, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format, meaning one JSON object per line. My task is to determine if this entire batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that each event has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process name in all these events is 'Dism.exe'. Dism.exe stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool, which is a legitimate Windows utility used for servicing Windows images. It's commonly used by IT professionals for tasks like enabling or disabling components in the Windows image.\n\nThe winlog field indicates that each event is related to \"File Executable Detected\" under the rule 'FileExecutableDetected'. This suggests that the system detected an executable file being accessed or executed, which is a standard security measure to monitor for potential malicious activities. However, since Dism.exe is a known legitimate process, this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThe file paths in all these events point to various DLL files located within a temporary directory under 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...'. The names of the files vary but end with '.dll' or '.mui', which are standard file extensions for dynamic link libraries and message user interface files, respectively. These files are typical in Windows environments and can be part of legitimate software operations.\n\nI notice that all events have similar structures and file paths, just different filenames being processed by Dism.exe. This repetition makes me think it's part of a normal process, possibly during system servicing or image deployment where multiple components are being accessed or processed.\n\nConsidering the combination of all these events, they all stem from the same process (Dism.exe) accessing various files in a temporary directory. Since each event individually doesn't indicate any malicious behavior and the process is legitimate, there's no immediate red flag when looking at them collectively either.\n\nHowever, it's important to ensure that this activity isn't part of an unusual or unexpected pattern for the system. If Dism.exe is running as part of a routine update or deployment task, these events would be normal. But if Dism.exe was launched unexpectedly or outside its usual operational times, it might warrant closer investigation.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm fairly confident that this batch isn't interesting because all elements point to legitimate operations by a known system tool. There's no evidence of irregular file accesses, such as attempting to execute non_DLL files, accessing restricted areas, or other signs of malicious activity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch doesn't show any signs of malicious behavior and seems to be part of standard system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to legitimate file processing by Dism.exe, a known Windows utility, accessing various DLL files in a temporary directory.

It's legitimate and often runs during system setup or updates. Deleting these MUI files might be part of a cleanup process after an update or customization.\n\nLooking at all the events together, they show multiple deletions by the same process in the same directory. The repeated pattern suggests it's not random but part of a systematic operation.

I remember that Dism is related to Deployment Image Service, which is used in Windows for deploying images, like during an OS installation or upgrade. So it's a legitimate system process.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, most of them are \"File Delete logged\" with the rule FileDeleteDetected. There's one event where the task is \"File creation time changed\" under the rule FileCreateTime. Hmm, but the majority involve deletions.\n\nThe files being deleted all have paths in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp followed by various .dll and .mui files. These seem to be temporary files created during some installation or update process. Dism is often used in such scenarios to manage image-based installations, so it makes sense that it's deleting these temp files after they're no longer needed.\n\nI don't see any signs of suspicious behavior here. The process is legitimate, and the actions taken are typical for Dism.exe during its operations. There's a consistent pattern with multiple deletions of temporary files, which aligns with how Dism works when cleaning up after an image deployment or servicing operation.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't indicate any malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's start by looking at each event individually and then see how they fit together.\n\nThe first 13 events are all from 'DismHost.exe' with the task being 'Image loaded'. Each one is loading a different DLL file into memory, all located in a temporary directory path that looks like it's specific to this process. The paths vary slightly each time, ending with different .dll files.\n\nAfter those, there's an event where 'DismHost.exe' terminates. That seems normal if the process is completing its tasks.\n\nThen, events 14-16 switch to 'Dism.exe', which is another process. These are file delete events, specifically deleting three DLL files from the same temporary directory that was used by DismHost.exe earlier. The files being deleted match some of those loaded earlier, like AppxProvider.dll and AssocProvider.dll.\n\nNow, putting this all together: It looks like DismHost.exe is loading several DLLs into memory, which could be part of its normal operation since these are providers related to system configuration or setup. Then, after the process terminates, another process (Dism.exe) deletes those DLL files. \n\nI should consider what's normal here. DismHost.exe is known as part of the Windows Deployment Services, used for image management and deployment. It makes sense that it would load various providers into memory. The temporary directory path also seems typical for such operations—using a temp folder to store these files temporarily.\n\nThe file deletion by Dism.exe might be part of the cleanup process after DismHost.exe finishes its tasks. So, while each step on its own could raise an eyebrow, together they seem like a normal sequence of events during deployment or system setup.\n\nIs there anything unusual here? The paths and filenames look legitimate, not common malicious ones. Also, no signs of privilege escalation or other red flags in the events provided.\n\nSo, considering all these points, this batch doesn't exhibit any overtly suspicious behavior that would warrant further investigation.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object indicating that Dism.exe has deleted a file from a specific path. The files being deleted are various DLLs in a temporary directory. \n\nI know that Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing the operating system, including tasks like deploying updates and managing features. It's not uncommon for it to delete files during its operations, especially when cleaning up after servicing.\n\nThe fact that multiple similar events occur with different DLL files deleted by the same process suggests this might be part of a normal maintenance routine rather than malicious activity. However, sometimes attackers can misuse legitimate tools, so I need to assess whether these actions are out of the ordinary.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to the same temporary directory. Temporary files are often created and deleted during software installations or updates. Dism.exe typically operates in such environments when performing image servicing tasks.\n\nConsidering that each event is a File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected), it's possible these deletions are part of an expected process. I don't see any red flags like deletion of system critical files, access to restricted directories, or unusual file names. The DLLs listed seem related to various providers which might be part of the servicing components.\n\nAnother point is that all events have the same process and similar log entries, indicating a repeated action rather than varied malicious behaviors. This repetition aligns with standard operating procedures for system updates or configurations.\n\nIn summary, while any unauthorized deletion could be concerning, in this case, the consistent use of Dism.exe and the nature of the files suggest these are legitimate actions during system servicing.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. Let me start by looking through each event one by one to see what's going on here.\n\nThe first event has a process command line that runs powershell.exe with some commands. It looks like it's creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and setting its binary path. Then it starts the service. That seems a bit unusual because creating services can be a way to persistence, which might be malicious.\n\nNext, there are several events where powershell is executed with -ExecutionPolicy Restricted and a simple Write-Host command. These just output 'Final result: 1'. I've seen similar scripts before; sometimes attackers use such scripts as part of their command and control mechanisms or to check if they have the right permissions.\n\nLooking further, there are more instances where powershell is run with the same restricted execution policy but different commands. Some of these seem to be checking for specific patterns in files located in the Windows INF directory. The script reads each .inf file and looks for a particular string related to default install sections. This could indicate that the attacker is trying to identify if certain drivers are installed or not, possibly as part of an exploit or persistence mechanism.\n\nThe tasks from the winlog field vary between 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle'. I'm not entirely sure what those mean specifically, but in general, these might be standard log entries when services start or stop. The fact that they alternate could indicate different stages of a process being run by the scripts.\n\nI also notice that all these events are related to powershell executions. Powershell is a powerful tool and often used by both administrators and attackers for scripting tasks. However, using it with -ExecutionPolicy Restricted might be an attempt to hide malicious activity since this policy restricts script execution but can sometimes be bypassed or used in certain ways.\n\nPutting all these together: there's one event creating a service, which is potentially suspicious because services can be used for persistence. Then multiple events running scripts that check files in the INF directory and others just outputting messages. The combination of creating a service and checking system files might suggest an attack like trying to install a backdoor or checking for existing vulnerabilities.\n\nI'm also thinking about how these events are spread out—there are several similar commands repeated, which could indicate testing different parts of a script or multiple attempts to execute something. The use of Write-Host in some scripts is common for outputting status but might be part of a larger malicious payload.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm leaning towards INTERESTING because while individual events might not be conclusive, the pattern of creating services and checking system files could indicate malicious activity. However, without more context like timestamps or other logs showing unusual behavior elsewhere, it's hard to be certain. But given the nature of powershell commands and the service creation, I think there's a reasonable chance this batch is worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell executions with potentially malicious scripts, including creating a new service and checking system files, which may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events that the user provided. Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. My job is to analyze all these events together and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, let me go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event has a process command line that runs powershell.exe with some arguments. The script seems to be checking INF files in the Windows directory. It sets $Res to 0 initially, then looks for specific patterns in these files. If it finds a match for [defaultinstall.nt followed by different architectures], it sets $Res to 1 and breaks out of the loop. Then it writes the result. The task here is \"Engine Lifecycle\" from winlog.\n\nThe second event is identical to the first one. Same command line, same task.\n\nThe third event has no process name but a task called \"Security Group Management\". Not sure what that entails exactly, but it's probably related to group policy or user management.\n\nThe fourth event shows a process named services.exe and a task called \"Logon\". Services.exe is a known Windows process related to the Service Control Manager, so this might be part of normal system operations during logon events.\n\nThe fifth event again has no process name but mentions \"Special Logon\" in the task. Special logons usually refer to system-level processes or services starting under certain contexts, which are common and not necessarily suspicious on their own.\n\nNow, putting it all together: I notice two instances of the PowerShell script checking INF files for specific patterns. This could be a red flag because scripts accessing system directories like Windows\\inf might be trying to gather information about drivers or system configurations, possibly with malicious intent. However, sometimes legitimate scripts do this too, so context is needed.\n\nThe other events seem more routine: services.exe starting during logon and tasks related to security group management are common in Windows logs. But the repetition of the PowerShell command is what catches my attention. It's run twice, which might indicate a loop or repeated checks, possibly trying to stay under the radar by not running continuously.\n\nI also consider that if this script was executed multiple times, it could be part of a persistence mechanism or checking for certain system states repeatedly. The fact that it's looking for specific patterns in INF files makes me think it's probing the system for something, which might be a sign of reconnaissance or preparing for an attack.\n\nOn the other hand, PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, and restricted execution policies mean some scripts can't run unless they're signed. But in this case, since ExecutionPolicy is set to Restricted, maybe there's a way this script is allowed but still doing something unusual enough to warrant closer look.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch does raise some flags because of the repeated use of PowerShell to query system files. While not necessarily conclusive on its own, it might indicate potential malicious activity that could be worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of a PowerShell script checking for specific patterns in system INF files may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to make sense of this data. It looks like a bunch of logs from somewhere, maybe Windows? There are entries with processes, winlog tasks, and sometimes files.\n\nStarting with the first entry, there's some XML-looking string in the process field. I see base64 encoding here; maybe it's some kind of event ID or something encoded for security. The task is 'Registry value set', which makes me think someone changed a registry key. Then, another entry has services.exe creating a process and setting a registry value again.\n\nNext, there's an sppsvc.exe loading taskschd.dll, which sounds normal because those are system processes. But then svchost.exe also sets a registry value, which is a bit suspicious since svchost can be used by malware.\n\nMost of the entries after that have 'None' in all fields, probably just noise or inactive logs. But towards the end, there's an interesting command line in powershell.exe. It's creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" and setting its binary path to some exe file. The path looks a bit off with spaces in \"unidade_logico\". Also, starting the service right after creation could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nI'm thinking someone is trying to create a persistent backdoor using a PowerShell script. The repeated entries suggest they're running this multiple times or it's part of an automated process. The file path might lead to further investigation if I can analyze that exe.\n\nOverall, the main red flags are the registry changes by svchost and services.exe, and the PowerShell command creating a new service with a potentially malicious binary.\n<\/think>\n\nThe data you've provided appears to be event logs, possibly from a Windows system. These logs contain information about processes, tasks performed by those processes (indicated by `winlog`), and any associated files. Below is an analysis of these logs:\n\n---\n\n### **1. First Entry**\n- **Process**: Contains a long base64-encoded string, likely representing an event ID or some encoded data.\n  - This could be related to system events like process creation or file operations.\n- **Winlog Task**: `\"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"`\n  - Indicates that a registry value was modified. This is common for legitimate system operations but can also be suspicious if it occurs during unauthorized activity.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Second Entry**\n- **Process**: `services.exe`\n  - A legitimate Windows process responsible for managing services.\n- **Winlog Task**: `\"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"`\n  - Again, a registry modification by `services.exe`, which is normal for service-related operations.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Third Entry**\n- **Process**: `sppsvc.exe`\n  - A legitimate Windows process related to the Service Protection Services.\n- **Winlog Task**: `\"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\"`\n  - Indicates that an image (DLL or EXE) was loaded into memory. The associated file is `C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskschd.dll`, which is a legitimate system file used by task scheduling services.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Fourth Entry**\n- **Process**: `svchost.exe`\n  - A common Windows process that hosts other services.\n- **Winlog Task**: `\"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"`\n  - Another registry modification, likely part of normal service operations.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Fifth to Tenth Entries**\n- All fields are marked as `\"None\"`, which suggests either:\n  - No relevant activity was detected for those entries.\n  - The logs were incomplete or filtered.\n\n---\n\n### **11th Entry**\n- **Process Command Line**: `powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\" Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}`\n  - This indicates that a PowerShell script was executed to create and start a new service named `objeto_ativo`.\n  - The binary path points to `tarefa_logico.exe` in the directory `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin`.\n\n- **Winlog Task**: `\"Provider Lifecycle\"`\n  - This suggests that the event is related to the creation or modification of a system service.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis**\n1. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple entries indicate registry value modifications by `services.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and other processes. While this can be normal, repeated registry changes can also be indicative of malicious activity (e.g., creating or modifying persistence mechanisms).\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - The PowerShell command is suspicious because it creates a new service (`objeto_ativo`) with a custom binary path. This could indicate the installation of malware or unauthorized services.\n\n3. **File Path**:\n   - The file path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` is unusual due to its structure and naming convention. Malicious actors often use such paths for persistence or to store malicious tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IOC)**\n1. **Process Name**: `objeto_ativo` (translated as \"active object\" in Portuguese). This could be a custom service created by malware.\n2. **Binary Path**: The path to `tarefa_logico.exe` seems suspicious and may contain malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Service**:\n   - Check if `objeto_ativo` is a legitimate service or if it was installed by unauthorized software.\n   - Use tools like `sc query` in Windows to view all registered services.\n\n2. **Inspect the Binary**:\n   - Analyze `tarefa_logico.exe` using antivirus scanning or sandboxing tools to determine if it's malicious.\n\n3. **Review PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Look for other instances of unusual PowerShell activity that could indicate script execution or credential dumping.\n\n4. **Monitor Registry Changes**:\n   - Use tools like Process Monitor (Procmon) to track registry access and identify any suspicious modifications.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need further clarification or assistance!"}
