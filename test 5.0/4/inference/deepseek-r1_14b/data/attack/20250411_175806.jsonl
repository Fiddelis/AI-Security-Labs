{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events and decide if it's interesting or not for investigation. So, each line is a JSON object with process info, winlog details, and sometimes a file path.\n\nLooking at the first few entries: there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessed. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it can execute commands and scripts, so repeated access could be suspicious. Then, whoami.exe is run without any arguments—usually harmless but maybe checking user info.\n\nNext, I notice cmd.exe being used with REG ADD commands in the command line. This modifies the registry's Run key, which can indicate persistence mechanisms. Attackers might add malicious entries here to run at startup. The specific paths like \"modulo_padrao.exe\" and \"pacote_temporario.exe\" seem suspicious; they don't look like standard system files.\n\nThere are several RegistryEvent tasks from different processes—powershell.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe. This combination of registry modifications might be part of setting up a persistence mechanism or installing malware components.\n\nAlso, conhost.exe is involved in a registry write. Conhost is often used by attackers to host malicious payloads because it's a legitimate Windows process, making it harder to detect.\n\nI see powershell.exe creating a file at \"modulo_padrao.txt\". Creating files can be part of writing scripts or tools, which could be malicious if the content isn't known.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe is involved in creating some .winlogbeat.yml.new files. Winlogbeat is an ELK tool for log shipping, so unless it's misused here, maybe not suspicious on its own. But since other processes are doing more concerning things, it might be part of a larger activity.\n\nPutting this all together: repeated use of powershell.exe with registry writes, cmd.exe adding entries to the Run key, and creation of files that don't seem standard—these could all be signs of malicious activity. The combination suggests possible installation of malware using multiple persistence methods and file creation for malicious scripts or tools.\n\nI think there's a high confidence here because several red flags are present across different processes and events. So I'd classify this batch as INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications, use of PowerShell, cmd.exe with REG ADD commands, and file creation by potentially malicious processes indicate possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
