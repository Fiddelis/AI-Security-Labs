{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events provided in JSONL format. There are nine events total. The first six entries all involve the process \"chrome.exe\" and show a task related to setting a registry value. That's interesting because while Chrome is a common application, frequent writes to the registry might indicate something unusual, especially if they're happening multiple times in quick succession.\n\nThen, there's an event involving \"powershell.exe\" accessing a process. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. The fact that it's accessing a process could be part of normal administration tasks or might signal something more nefarious like privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.\n\nThe next entry stands out because it's \"whoami.exe\" being executed with no command line arguments. Whoami is typically used to determine user information, but its execution without additional parameters could be a red flag if it's part of a larger chain of events meant to gather system information for attack planning or lateral movement.\n\nAnother PowerShell access event follows, which reinforces the idea that there might be suspicious activity related to these processes. The repetition of accessing powershell.exe in quick succession raises my concern because legitimate use would vary and not necessarily involve such close timing.\n\nLooking at all these together, it's concerning because multiple instances of process creation and activity with tools known for both benign and malicious uses are present. The combination of registry writes by Chrome, the repeated PowerShell accesses, and the execution of whoami.exe could indicate a potential attack vector or unauthorized access.\n\nI need to consider whether this batch is indicative of malicious behavior. While each event on its own might not be alarming, together they paint a picture that's worth investigating further. The confidence level isn't too high because isolated events can sometimes be normal, but the pattern here does raise questions about potential compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Chrome.exe modifying registry values and subsequent PowerShell process accesses, along with a whoami.exe execution may indicate potentially malicious activity or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where different processes like svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe are performing various tasks. The main actions logged include Registry value sets, file creations, and image loads.\n\nLooking closer, I notice that svchost.exe appears multiple times with a task of setting registry values. This is suspicious because svchost.exe is commonly used by malware to hide their activities. Also, powershell.exe is involved in creating a file named 'unidade_ativo.txt'. Powershell is often a target for attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities.\n\nThere are several instances where files are being created or accessed. For example, chrome.exe is accessing specific DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. While these might be legitimate actions, the frequency and combination with other events could indicate something malicious.\n\nThe event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory seems odd. It looks like it's trying to write a new configuration file, which could be part of log management but might also be an attempt to alter logs or create persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm particularly concerned about the number of Registry value sets across various processes. Malware often uses registry modifications to maintain persistence or configure malicious settings. The repetitive nature of these events across different executables makes me think there's a pattern here, possibly indicating a coordinated attack.\n\nThe creation of 'unidade_ativo.txt' by powershell.exe stands out. Without knowing the context, this file could be a beacon for C2 communication or part of data exfiltration.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it seems like there are multiple red flags pointing towards potential malicious activity. The combination of registry modifications, file creations in sensitive locations, and use of tools like powershell.exe that are commonly exploited, make the batch interesting from a security perspective.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes, including svchost.exe and powershell.exe, show suspicious activity such as registry modifications and file creation. These actions could indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. I'm going to go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nStarting with the first few entries, I notice that 'chrome.exe' is making network connections and DNS queries. That's pretty normal for a browser, so nothing suspicious there yet.\n\nThen there's 'RuntimeBroker.exe' setting a registry value. Runtime Broker is related to Windows Store apps, so that activity doesn't raise any red flags either.\n\nNext up is 'notepad.exe' accessing the registry. Notepad isn't typically malicious, but I should keep an eye on what it's doing. It might be related to some script or configuration change, but alone it's not a big deal.\n\nLooking at 'powershell.exe', it accessed another process. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes, so this could be something. But without more context, I'm not sure yet.\n\nThe next event has 'calc.exe' loading the urlmon.dll. That seems odd because Calculator usually doesn't load DLLs related to URL handling. This might indicate some kind of injection or malicious activity.\n\nThen there's a command line for 'cmd.exe' creating scheduled tasks that run calc.exe on startup and logon. Scheduled tasks can be legitimate, but having multiple ones created by cmd.exe with such commands is suspicious. It looks like someone is trying to persist calc.exe in the system.\n\nAnother 'powershell.exe' accessing processes againâ€”could be part of malicious scripting or just a regular admin task. Not enough info yet.\n\nThen more registry writes from svchost.exe, which is a known process for services. It's hard to say without knowing which service it is, but multiple writes might indicate something is modifying configurations.\n\nLooking further down, I see schtasks.exe creating tasks with commands that run calc.exe. This is concerning because creating scheduled tasks via command line can hide malicious activities. The fact that they're set to trigger on logon and startup suggests an attempt at persistence.\n\nThere's also 'svchost.exe' creating a file in the Tasks directory. That could be part of legitimate Windows operations, but again, when combined with other events, it might indicate something more.\n\nFinally, another schtasks.exe creating a task that runs calc.exe on startup as system. This is definitely worrying because running calc.exe as system has limited use and seems suspicious.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple instances of process creations (cmd.exe and schtasks.exe) setting up scheduled tasks to run calc.exe on logon or startup, along with some registry modifications and an unusual DLL load in calc.exe. These actions are common tactics for persistence and could be part of a malicious payload trying to establish long-term access.\n\nTherefore, the batch is definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity, including suspicious process creations, registry modifications, and scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe. These could be signs of persistence or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
