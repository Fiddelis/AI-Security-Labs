{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Most of them are User Account Management tasks from the winlog. That's pretty common and usually not suspicious on its own. Then there are a few Excel.EXE processes. Those could be normal if someone is just using Excel.\n\nLooking closer, one event shows that Excel loaded coml2.dll, which seems legitimate since it's in System32. But then I see several file creation events pointing to real_values.csv.LNK in the Recent folder. That might indicate someone is working with files there, but without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple DNS queries from Excel. While apps do make DNS requests, unusual or repeated lookups could be a sign of something bad, like checking for domains related to malicious activities. However, the fact that these are all in a short batch makes me think maybe it's part of a legitimate process, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nI'm leaning towards marking this as interesting because of the combination: multiple User Account Management events and repeated DNS queries from Excel. It might be worth looking into further to ensure there's no unauthorized activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'User Account Management' tasks and repeated DNS queries from Excel process may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where the process is \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading different DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. This seems normal because these are common Windows system files being loaded by legitimate processes. No red flags here yet.\n\nNext, there are a couple of events related to user account management. These could be standard user logon\/logoff activities or group policy changes. Without more context, it's hard to say if they're suspicious, but they don't immediately raise concerns.\n\nThen, I notice an entry where \"rundll32.exe\" is called with a command line parameter that includes shell32.dll and a GUID. This could be legitimate since rundll32 is a standard utility used to execute functions from DLLs. However, the use of a specific GUID might warrant closer inspection, but it's not conclusive evidence of malicious activity on its own.\n\nThe \"svchost.exe\" process setting registry values isn't unusual either. Svchost is a common host process for services, and it often interacts with the Windows Registry. Unless there are signs of unauthorized changes or persistence mechanisms, this doesn't seem concerning.\n\nThere are two instances where \"winlogbeat.exe\" creates files in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely the service responsible for collecting and sending log data, so creating configuration files isn't suspicious.\n\nThe Excel process (\"EXCEL.EXE\") loading various DLLs like combase.dll, mscoree.dll, etc., is expected behavior since Excel relies on these system libraries to function. There's no indication here that Excel is being exploited or behaving maliciously.\n\nAnother rundll32.exe entry loading shell32.dll again with the same GUID—this repetition might be normal depending on what's triggering it, but without more context, it's hard to label as suspicious.\n\nThe \"RuntimeBroker.exe\" modifying registry values is another standard operation since Runtime Broker handles app container services. No cause for alarm here unless there's evidence of unauthorized changes.\n\nThere's an event with a null process and task set to \"None.\" This could be an error or just noise in the logs, but it doesn't provide any actionable information on its own.\n\nMultiple instances of EXCEL.EXE loading different DLLs continue, which as I mentioned earlier, is normal for Excel's operation. No signs of malicious activity here.\n\nA \"WmiPrvSE.exe\" process starting with specific command-line arguments and loading a DLL—WMI is a legitimate part of Windows management, so unless there are known exploits associated with this exact behavior, it doesn't raise red flags.\n\nLastly, the services.exe and another null process with special logon task. Services.exe is responsible for managing system services, and special logon typically refers to non-interactive sessions, which is normal during system startup or service operations.\n\nPutting all these events together, I don't see any clear indicators of malicious behavior. The repeated processes and DLL loads are within the realm of legitimate activity, especially considering that many of them involve common Windows utilities and system files. While some actions like the use of rundll32.exe with specific GUIDs or WmiPrvSE could potentially be vectors for attacks, without additional context or evidence of deviation from baseline behavior, they don't rise to the level of being concerning.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing the entire batch, there's no strong indication that these events are malicious or indicative of a security incident. They appear to be normal system operations and process activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of standard system processes loading legitimate DLLs and performing routine tasks such as user account management, file creation, and registry value changes. No signs of malicious behavior are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
