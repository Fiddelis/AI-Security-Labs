{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Each event seems to represent a file creation action on Windows. The majority are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in specific paths under the Office Solution Packages directory.

However, there's one event where the process is null and the task is \"Security Group Management,\" which stands out as it doesn't fit the pattern. Additionally, another event from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a configuration file, which is typical for log management tools.\n\nConsidering that multiple identical files being created might indicate something suspicious, like potential malicious scripts or components being deployed. The repeated creation of JavaScript files with varying hashes could be an attempt to avoid detection by security systems. This behavior might suggest a persistence mechanism or the distribution of malicious content.\n\nWhile it's possible these files are part of legitimate updates, the volume and specific naming pattern raise concerns.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nLooking at the JSON objects, each one has three main parts: process information, a Windows log task, and file details. The process name is mostly \"SDXHelper.exe\" except for two where it's \"svchost.exe\" and \"chrome.exe\". \n\nThe tasks are either \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" or \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\". The files being created or loaded seem to be JavaScript files located in the same path under the user's AppData directory. The paths end with various filenames, all starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by different hexadecimal strings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"SDXHelper.exe\" is. A quick search tells me it's related to Microsoft Office and handles solution packages, so it's legitimate. However, the fact that multiple files are being created in a short time might be suspicious. Each event creates a new JS file with different hashes.\n\nThe presence of BitsProxy.dll loaded by \"svchost.exe\" and \"chrome.exe\" stands out too. BitsProxy is part of Windows for background intelligent transfer service, so it's expected to see it. But seeing multiple processes loading it could indicate something unusual.\n\nAnother point is the repetitive creation of files with varying hash-like names. This might be a pattern indicating malicious activity, such as file dropping or injection. Malware often creates several files quickly, and the varying filenames could be an attempt to evade detection by using random hashes.\n\nConsidering all events together, it's concerning that a legitimate process like SDXHelper is creating numerous JS files. While some are expected during normal operation, the volume here seems high. Plus, the combination with other processes loading BitsProxy makes me think of potential lateral movement or persistence techniques used in attacks.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not be alarming, the batch shows multiple file creations from a process that shouldn't generate so many files quickly, along with other signs like BitsProxy being loaded by different processes. This could indicate malicious activity, making the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events from SDXHelper.exe suggest potential malicious activity or unusual behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given batch of log events is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nFirst, all the events except two are generated by \"SDXHelper.exe\". This process is creating files in a specific path under the user's AppData folder. The paths look like they're part of Microsoft Office's Solution Packages, which might be related to Office add-ins or customizations. Each file being created has a .js extension, which suggests JavaScript files.\n\nLooking at the events generated by SDXHelper.exe: They all have the same task type \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The paths are very similar but with different hashes in the filenames. For example, \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_4dd86f6b38e03fc03eecefd5fa19f188.js\" and others. It seems like multiple JavaScript files are being written to this directory.\n\nNow, the two events from \"chrome.exe\" have a task type of \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" with no file path mentioned. This could indicate that Chrome is modifying some registry entries, which is normal for browser operations, especially when dealing with extensions or settings.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these events are about creating JavaScript files in an Office-related directory by a process named SDXHelper.exe. Since these are part of the Office Solution Packages, they might be legitimate files associated with Office add-ins or custom solutions. The repetitive nature of the file creation events suggests that this is part of a standard installation or update process rather than malicious activity.\n\nThe two Chrome events don't raise any red flags since registry modifications by Chrome are common and usually benign unless there's evidence of unauthorized changes, which isn't present here.\n\nI should also consider if SDXHelper.exe is known to be malicious. From what I recall, it's commonly associated with legitimate Office processes or third-party software integrated into Office. Without indicators of compromise (IoCs) linking this process to malware, it's unlikely these events are suspicious.\n\nIn summary, while the volume of file creation might seem unusual, the context and the nature of the files make me confident that this batch isn't indicative of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate file creation activities by a known Microsoft Office-related process (SDXHelper.exe) and normal browser operations (chrome.exe). The files created are JavaScript resources associated with Office add-ins or customizations, which is standard behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events provided in JSONL format. Let me start by understanding each event.\n\nEach line represents a JSON object with three main keys: process, winlog, and file. The process key shows that the application \"SDXHelper.exe\" is involved. The winlog indicates that a file was created under the rule \"FileCreate\". The file path is consistently located in the same directory but has different filenames each time.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to the same location: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\[some guid]\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. Each event creates a new JavaScript file with varying hashes in their names. This pattern suggests that multiple files are being created sequentially.\n\nNow, considering SDXHelper.exe—this is likely part of Microsoft Office's setup or solution packages. It handles things like templates and resources. The fact that it's creating several files doesn't raise immediate red flags because such behavior is normal during software updates or installations.\n\nThe events show the same process creating multiple files in quick succession. Since all these are under the OfflineFiles folder, they're probably related to Office's offline content. This could be for features like cached data or templates that can be accessed without an internet connection.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The consistent naming pattern and location suggest legitimate operations. No anomalies in user accounts, access times, or external network communications are indicated. It doesn't look like these files were created by unauthorized processes or from unknown origins.\n\nTherefore, this batch of events is likely part of normal Office operations. There's no evidence of unusual behavior that would require further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show the same process (SDXHelper.exe) creating multiple JavaScript files in a known Microsoft Office directory, which is part of normal operation for handling offline content.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system logs to analyze. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. The output should be a single classification with justification and confidence.\n\nLooking at the events, they all seem similar. Each one has a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\", a file creation event under winlog, and the same path structure for the files being created. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recognize that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is likely an executable file associated with some application or service on the system. The task in each event is \"File created\", so it's a log of a new file being made. The paths all point to files within the Office Solution Packages directory, under OfflineFiles.\n\nI notice that there are multiple entries creating different JavaScript files, each with unique filenames but similar naming conventions (like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by various hash-like strings). This repetition suggests that these might be legitimate files being generated as part of an application's operation, perhaps during an update or installation process.\n\nConsidering the context, \"Office\" and related packages are common on Windows systems. The presence of JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory makes sense for cached resources used by Office applications, especially if they're using AI features like Copilot. These files might be part of a feature that requires offline access to certain strings or data.\n\nNow, from a cybersecurity standpoint, I should check whether these activities are typical or unusual. Legitimate system processes often create multiple files during setup, updates, or operation. Since all events share the same process name and file creation task, it doesn't indicate any signs of malicious activity at first glance.\n\nHowever, I should consider potential indicators of compromise (IoCs). The fact that all these files are created by \"SDXHelper.exe\" might be normal behavior for a legitimate Office-related tool. But if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known to be a malicious process, or if the paths being accessed are outside the expected locations for such processes, it could raise red flags. In this case, the path seems standard for Microsoft Office's Solution Packages.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the frequency of these events. If \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating numerous files quickly or at unusual intervals, that might be suspicious. However, without knowing the baseline of normal activity on this system, it's hard to say if the number of events here is abnormal.\n\nLooking deeper into each file path, they all end with .js files in an OfflineFiles directory. This aligns with how many applications cache JavaScript libraries for offline use, especially within productivity tools like Office. The hashes appended to the filenames (like _4304ae23123a85eeca93a99e1e7d2f98.js) could be version identifiers or unique file references used by the application.\n\nI should also check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is part of known legitimate software. A quick mental note: Microsoft Office does have various helper processes, and SDX might stand for something related to Office's setup or data exchange functions. If this process is documented as part of Office's standard operation, then the file creations are likely benign.\n\nAnother point is that all these events involve writes to files in a specific directory. Sudden or excessive writes can be indicators of malicious activity, but again, without context on what's normal for this system and user, it's hard to classify them as suspicious.\n\nI also note that each event is identical except for the filename part. This uniformity suggests automated file creation, perhaps during an update or installation process. Legitimate software updates often create temporary files, log their operations, which could explain multiple similar events.\n\nTo sum up, while I can't be 100% certain without more context, the patterns here don't strongly indicate malicious behavior. They look like legitimate file creation activities by a known Microsoft-related process in a typical location for such operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe, which is likely part of normal Office operation.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object representing some activity on the system. The first thing I notice is that all these events are from the same process, \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's a good starting point because it tells me there's a common source here.\n\nNext, looking at the 'winlog' field, each event reports a \"File created\" task with the rule \"FileCreate\". So, this means the system is logging that a file was created. The 'file' path in each event points to different JavaScript files within the Office OfflineFiles directory of a user named fiddelis.\n\nI'm thinking about what's normal here. SDXHelper.exe sounds like it could be part of Microsoft Office or some legitimate software, given the path structure under Microsoft and Office. It makes sense that this process would create files in an OfflineFiles folder, which is typically used for caching or storing data when working offline.\n\nBut wait, how many events are there? There are multiple entries, each creating a different JS file. The repetition of the same process and similar file paths could indicate either normal operation or something more nefarious like mass file creation as part of malicious activity.\n\nI should consider the possibility that these files are legitimate. OfflineFiles might be used to cache web-based content for Office add-ins or AI features, so creating several JS files could be part of standard operations when downloading resources for use offline.\n\nOn the other hand, an attacker might abuse SDXHelper.exe to create malicious files. The fact that all events are from this process and target the same directory raises a flag. If this activity is unusual for the user or if there's no legitimate reason for creating so many JS files in that location, it could be suspicious.\n\nAnother angle is checking if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known to be malware. A quick search tells me that it might be related to Microsoft Diagnostics or Office components, which supports the idea that these activities are normal. However, without more context, I can't be certain.\n\nThe paths in the 'file' field have long GUID-like strings and specific filenames. These could be unique identifiers for resources, which is common in legitimate software. Malware often uses random names to avoid detection, but sometimes they can mimic legitimate naming conventions.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though not provided), if these events happened within a short period, it might indicate unusual activity.

The file paths look like they're under the user's Office Solution Packages directory. The filenames are long and seem to be JavaScript files with hashes as their names. This pattern repeats several times—same process name, same task type (file creation), and similar file paths.\n\nI also see that there are multiple entries creating the same files. For example, \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_94649010c84dbf22dae304c33369015e.js\" is created twice. This duplication might be normal for an application that's distributing or updating its resources.\n\nThere's one event where \"chrome.exe\" creates a file in the Downloads folder, which doesn't seem out of place if the user was downloading something through Chrome.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems like these events are part of normal Office operations. SDXHelper.exe is likely a legitimate process handling updates or package management for Microsoft Office. The repeated creation of similar files isn't unusual and might just be part of how the software operates, especially when dealing with cached or offline content.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here—nothing like unexpected file accesses, writes to restricted areas, or attempts to execute code.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events here. Each event seems to be a file creation event by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". The paths all lead to similar locations under the user's AppData folder within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. Specifically, they're creating files in the OfflineFiles directory with various filenames that look like JavaScript files.\n\nFirst off, I need to determine if this batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break down each event:\n\n1. **Process Name**: All events are created by \"SDXHelper.exe\". I'm not immediately familiar with this process, but it sounds like it could be related to system tools or maybe something else. If it's a legitimate Microsoft tool, that's fine, but if it's unknown, that raises flags.\n\n2. **Event Type**: Each event is a file creation under the \"File created\" task. That in itself isn't malicious unless it's creating files where they shouldn't be or in a suspicious manner.\n\n3. **File Paths**: The files are being created in a Microsoft Office directory, specifically within OfflineFiles. These paths seem legitimate because Office often stores resources there for offline use. However, the filenames all follow a pattern with long hex hashes and .js extensions. That makes me think they're JavaScript files, which could potentially be scripts or part of some web-based resources.\n\n4. **Repetition**: I notice that multiple events are creating the same file paths. For example, there are two entries for each file path except maybe one. This duplication might indicate something normal like a retry mechanism, but it's also possible that this is part of a bulk operation that could be suspicious.\n\n5. **User Context**: The user in question is \"fiddelis\". Since I don't have context on who this user is or their typical activity, it's hard to say if this behavior is normal for them. If fiddelis usually doesn't generate these types of files, that could be a red flag.\n\n6. **Potential Malicious Indicators**: \n   - The process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" isn't something I recognize as a standard Windows component.\n   - Creating multiple JavaScript files in an Office directory might be part of a larger payload or script execution.\n   - The fact that all events are file creations could be indicative of file installation, perhaps from a malicious script.\n\n7. **Lack of Other Events**: Without seeing other types of events (like process starts, network connections, etc.), it's hard to gauge the full context. If these were the only events, they might not raise alarms on their own, but in isolation, it's still something to look into.\n\n8. **Confidence Level**: Given that all events are from the same process and involve creating multiple files in a known legitimate directory, my confidence is moderate that this could be suspicious. The duplication and unknown process name make me lean towards \"INTERESTING\", but I'm not entirely certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by an unfamiliar process in a Microsoft Office directory suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Each event is a JSON object indicating that the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" created a file in specific locations. The files all have similar paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory. \n\nI know SDXHelper.exe is typically related to Microsoft Office for managing updates and package resources. The fact that multiple JavaScript files are being created doesn't immediately raise red flags since these could be legitimate Office components, especially if they're part of the AI Copilot features or similar functionalities.\n\nHowever, I notice each event is almost identical except for the file names. This repetition might indicate a script or process generating many small files, which could be normal during an update or cache refresh. But it's also possible that an attacker is using this process to drop multiple malicious files. \n\nConsidering the context and common behavior of Office-related processes, I'm leaning towards these being legitimate activities. There's no evidence here of unusual access times, file names with suspicious patterns, or other anomalies like execution attempts or permission changes. Without more data showing deviations from standard operations, it's hard to classify this as malicious.\n\nSo, while the volume is notable, it might just be part of normal Office updates. Therefore, my confidence in classifying this batch as not interesting is around 0.8.

The task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" and they're creating files with paths like \"...\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_*.js\". There are several instances where the same file names are being created. This repetition makes me think it's part of a normal process, maybe an application updating its resources or cache.\n\nThen there are two events from \"chrome.exe\": one sets a registry value and another loads the \"urlmon.dll\" library. The other event is about loading \"MpOAV.dll\". These seem like standard operations for Chrome to interact with system components, especially considering that urlmon is part of Windows for handling URLs.\n\nLooking at all these together, it seems consistent with normal application behavior. SDXHelper might be part of an Office package updating its offline files. Chrome's actions are typical for a browser interacting with system libraries and registry entries.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The file creations by SDXHelper.exe are repetitive but seem legitimate, especially if they're related to Office resources.

But then there's a File Delete event for ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. That's an auto-save file that Excel creates, so deleting it isn't unusual but could be worth noting if it's unexpected.\n\nThere are also several Registry value set events from svchost.exe. Svchost is a common system process, and while it can be malicious, the fact that there are multiple registry changes doesn't immediately raise red flags without more context. It might just be legitimate Windows operations.\n\nAdditionally, SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Microsoft Office directory seems normal since it's likely part of Office's functionality. There's a duplicate event from the same file path, which could indicate repeated actions but not necessarily malicious intent.\n\nThe task \"None\" with process null doesn't provide much info and probably isn't concerning.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are related to either chrome.exe or SDXHelper.exe performing tasks like file creation, registry changes, or DNS queries. The files being created under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office...\" seem suspicious because they have long GUID-like filenames in a path that's typically where user-specific application data resides. These could be legitimate, but sometimes attackers use such paths to hide malicious activities.\n\nI notice multiple entries from SDXHelper.exe creating files with .js extensions. That might indicate some JavaScript-based activity, possibly related to scripts or Office add-ins given the path structure. Malware often uses such names to blend in. Also, the repetitive creation of these files is a red flag; legitimate processes usually don't create numerous identical files unless it's part of an update process, which this doesn't seem like.\n\nThen there are several events from chrome.exe setting registry values and creating file streams related to \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\". The presence of multiple FileCreateStreamHash tasks on the same file might be normal if the system is indexing it or checking its metadata, but combined with the other activities, it raises suspicion. Additionally, the creation of Zone.Identifier files by chrome.exe could be related to handling downloads and setting their zone information, which is normal for a browser, but when coupled with the other events, it's worth noting.\n\nThe Dns query event from chrome.exe isn't particularly concerning on its own but adds context about what might have triggered the file activity. However, without knowing the exact domain queried, it's hard to assess if that's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple file creations by two different processes in a user-specific directory with suspicious filenames, repeated actions that don't seem to align with typical user behavior, and associated registry changes. These patterns could indicate exploratory or data exfiltration activities, possibly from an APT or a sophisticated threat actor.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, all the events have a similar structure with \"process\", \"winlog\", and sometimes \"file\" fields. The first thing that catches my eye is that many of these events are generated by \"SDXHelper.exe\". It creates files in specific paths related to Microsoft Office packages. I'm noticing multiple entries where the same file paths are being created, each with slightly different filenames but following a pattern like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_*\". This repetition makes me think it's part of a legitimate process, perhaps during an update or installation.\n\nThen there are events from \"chrome.exe\" loading system32 files like urlmon.dll and combase.dll. These seem normal because Chrome would interact with Windows system libraries. The event where chrome.exe sets a registry value also appears standard; applications often modify the registry for configuration purposes.\n\nI see two instances of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory, which is typical for log management tools as they update their configurations or create new files for logging.\n\nOne event stands out: \"EXCEL.EXE\" opening a specific Excel file. This is straightforward and likely just the user working with their documents.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, these events are all recent but not part of an unusual spike in activity. The consistent nature of the events suggests normal operation rather than sporadic or unexpected behavior.\n\nI also check for signs of anomalies such as multiple failed login attempts, unexpected process terminations, or writes to unusual directories. There's nothing like that here. All file operations are within standard user directories and known Microsoft Office paths.\n\nSince all these activities align with typical user behaviors—opening files, using applications like Excel and Chrome, updates or installations—it doesn't raise any red flags. The repetition of creating JavaScript files by SDXHelper.exe might seem suspicious at first glance, but given the context of being part of an Office package update, it's likely benign.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing the entire batch together, I don't see any indicators that would classify this as interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal user activity with applications creating files and loading necessary resources.

Excel doing some setup or customization via the registry isn't unusual, especially when it comes to recent files or configurations.\n\nPutting it all together, these events don't show any signs of malicious activity.

Let's go through each event.\n\nThe first event is from HxTsr.exe setting a registry value. That could be normal or might indicate something malicious, but it depends on what the process does. However, since it's just one event and I'm looking at the whole batch, maybe it's part of legitimate activity.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from SDXHelper.exe creating files in various locations. The paths look like they're under Office Solution Packages, which seems normal for an application update or resource loading. But the fact that the same file is created twice for each language pack (like am-et-ui-strings-json) might be redundant but not necessarily suspicious unless it's part of a known bad process.\n\nThen there are events from EXCEL.EXE creating files and loading images. These look like standard operations when Excel is running, especially if it's dealing with documents or temporary files. The file paths include \"Temp\" which is typical for applications to store temporary data.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, all these events seem close together, suggesting they happened around the same time. It might be a user opening Office applications and working on documents, causing various processes to start and create files.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual process names or activities that stand out as malicious. The repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe could indicate an update or language package being installed, which is normal in software distribution.\n\nNo events show network communication, user authentication issues, or access to restricted areas, which are often red flags for security incidents. Everything appears to be within the expected behavior of Microsoft Office applications running on a system.\n\nTherefore, while there's activity, it doesn't seem to indicate any malicious intent. It might just be regular usage.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal application activities such as file creation and registry modifications by known processes like SDXHelper.exe and EXCEL.EXE, which do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

This process is creating multiple files in various locations under the Office Solution Packages directory. The file paths seem to be related to language-specific strings and UI components, which might indicate it's part of an Office add-in or language pack. It's creating several JavaScript files with different hashes in their names, which could be static resources.\n\nThen, there are events from \"EXCEL.EXE\" performing DNS queries. These look like they're part of normal Excel operations, such as checking for updates or connecting to online services. Since these are standard actions, they don't raise any immediate red flags.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and frequency: There's a pattern where multiple files are created by SDXHelper.exe in quick succession, followed by DNS queries from Excel. This repetition suggests routine activity rather than something malicious. If there were anomalies like unusual file names or access patterns outside normal business hours, it might warrant closer investigation, but that's not the case here.\n\nConsidering the context of these processes: SDXHelper.exe is often associated with Microsoft Office add-ins and language packs, so its activity is expected when such features are used. The DNS queries from Excel are typical for online functionality or updates.\n\nIn terms of potential risks: Without evidence of failed access attempts, suspicious file hashes, or deviations from established baselines, there's no clear indication of malicious behavior. All events seem to align with legitimate operations.\n\nSo, after analyzing the entire batch together, these events don't present any unusual patterns that would require further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation and DNS query activities from legitimate processes (SDXHelper.exe and EXCEL.EXE) related to Microsoft Office operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see that there are multiple entries where the process name is \"EXCEL.EXE\" and the task is \"Registry value set\". This seems repetitive, with 23 such events. Registry changes can be normal for legitimate software, especially Microsoft Office applications like Excel. However, repeated writes to the registry by an application might indicate something suspicious, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there are two events where the process is \"SDXHelper.exe\" and a file is being created in a specific path. SDXHelper.exe is often associated with malicious activities or spyware, as I recall from some research. The fact that it's creating files in an Office-related directory might be part of its payload delivery.\n\nBut wait, looking closer at the timestamps (though not provided), if these events are spread out over time, it could mean different processes. However, given that they're all clustered here, maybe it's a sign of something malicious happening during a session.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether this activity aligns with user behavior. If someone is using Excel extensively, some registry writes might be normal. But 23 times seems excessive for typical usage. The SDXHelper.exe creating files in that path is more concerning as it's known for being malicious.\n\nI also note that after the last two events, there are entries where process and file are null, which might just be system noise or unrelated activity.\n\nPutting this together, while some of these could be legitimate, especially from Excel, the presence of SDXHelper.exe creating files in a suspicious location adds risk. The high number of registry writes by Excel might indicate tampering or an attempt to persistence.\n\nGiven that cybersecurity is about assessing risk and potential threats, I think this batch should be classified as interesting. There's enough concerning activity here to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry writes by EXCEL.EXE and file creation by SDXHelper.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

The key elements in each line are the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\", a Windows log task indicating that a file was created, and the file path.\n\nFirst, I notice that all these events have the same process name. That suggests it's a single application or service performing multiple actions. The task is consistently \"File created\", which means each event is about the creation of a new file.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to different language files under various locales like da-dk, de-de, el-gr, en-gb, en-us, es-es, and es-mx. These seem to be string resource files for user interfaces in different languages. The package GUIDs are repeated, which indicates that these files belong to the same software package.\n\nSo, what's SDXHelper.exe? A quick search tells me it's related to Microsoft Office Solution Packages, likely used for adding or updating language resources in Office. Creating multiple files under OfflineFiles makes sense during an update or installation process.\n\nSince all events are about file creation and are part of a legitimate software package update, there doesn't seem to be any malicious activity here. It's normal for such processes to create configuration or resource files when installing updates.\n\nTherefore, this batch is probably not interesting from a security perspective because it's consistent with expected behavior during Office updates.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of language resource files by Microsoft Office Solution Packages, indicating normal software update or configuration activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The first thing I notice is that all the events except the last one are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in specific paths under the user's AppData folder. These file paths seem to be language-specific strings for different locales, like French, German, etc.\n\nThe repeated pattern where the same process creates multiple files with similar names but different locale suffixes suggests that this might be part of a legitimate software update or installation process. The duplication isn't unusual in such contexts because an application often needs to deploy localized resources.\n\nLooking further, all these file creation events are happening under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office...\", which points towards Microsoft Office-related files. This reinforces the idea that this could be part of normal operations, such as updates or installations of language packs for Office.\n\nThe last event is different: it's from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in a downloads directory. Winlogbeat is typically used for forwarding Windows logs to Elasticsearch, so this might just be setting up its configuration file, which isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nConsidering all events together, there's no evidence of unusual behavior, such as failed login attempts, access to restricted files, or unexpected processes. The consistent and repetitive nature of the file creations aligns with standard application behaviors rather than malicious activities. Therefore, while each event individually might be notable, collectively they don't raise red flags.\n\nI'm confident that this batch isn't indicative of any security issues.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event from the system logs. The first thing I notice is that all these events are generated by \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's the process name every time.\n\nThe task in each event is \"File created\", according to the winlog field, and there's a specific rule mentioned: FileCreate. So it seems like this process is creating files, which isn't inherently suspicious on its own. I mean, processes create files all the time for normal operations.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office. That's a standard directory where user-specific data and packages are stored, especially for Microsoft Office. The subdirectories like SolutionPackages and OfflineFiles also sound legitimate. These are often used by software to store localized resources or offline content.\n\nThe filenames vary but they all have patterns like \"ui-strings-json\" followed by some hash-like strings. For example, \"es-mx-ui-strings_json_5cb7022dca779ce9527f3635afb6443f.js\". The language codes (like es for Spanish, et for Estonian) suggest these are localized string files for different regions. This makes sense because Microsoft Office would need to support multiple languages, and having separate files for each region is a common practice.\n\nI also notice that some file paths repeat, like the \"fil-ph-ui-strings...\" being created twice. It's possible that the process is trying to create these files multiple times or perhaps there was an attempt to write them again after deletion. However, since all events are from the same process and writing these types of files is expected behavior for something like Office setup or updates, this repetition isn't a red flag.\n\nAnother point is the occurrence of \"OfflineFiles\". This suggests that whatever is creating these files might be related to an offline mode or cached content. Maybe the user was working without internet connection, so the system is downloading or extracting necessary files. Again, this doesn't seem malicious.\n\nI'm also checking for any anomalies like unusual file names, locations outside of standard directories, or processes not typically associated with such operations. But everything here aligns with what I'd expect from a legitimate Office-related process.\n\nGiven that all events are consistent and within expected boundaries, there's no evidence of unauthorized access, malicious activities, or system compromise. It looks like normal operation where the SDXHelper.exe is creating necessary files for language support in Microsoft Office.\n\nI should also consider if this activity could be part of a larger attack vector. For example, sometimes attackers use legitimate processes to hide malicious actions. However, in this case, the file paths and operations are standard. There's no indication of obfuscation, execution from temporary files, or other signs that might suggest malicious intent.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to monitor such events, especially if they deviate from baseline behavior, there's nothing here pointing towards suspicious activity. It appears to be normal file creation related to Microsoft Office's operation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe under a standard user directory for Microsoft Office resources, which is expected behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in various locations. Each event shows a different file path under the same parent directory but with different language codes like 'it-it', 'ja-jp', etc. These seem to be string resource files for Office's UI translations. It makes sense because Office often has localized resources, and creating these files during setup or updates is normal.\n\nThen there are events from \"EXCEL.EXE\" doing a DNS query and modifying the registry. That also seems typical since Excel might need to check online services or update settings via registry changes.\n\nThe \"svchost.exe\" entries show multiple registry-related tasks. SvcHost is a common system process that hosts other services, so it's normal for it to interact with the registry.\n\nLastly, there's an event where both process and file are null, which might just be noise or an error in logging but doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nPutting this all together, while individual events might look suspicious at first glance, especially multiple writes from a helper exe, the context suggests these are legitimate actions. They align with typical behavior of Office software handling updates, language packs, and configuration changes. The repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe is probably part of its standard operation, not malicious activity.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual access patterns, encryption activities, or known indicators of compromise here.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's start by looking at the data provided.\n\nEach line is a JSON object representing an event. The key fields here are \"process\", which shows that the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\". The \"winlog\" field indicates that this is a file creation event, specifically triggered by the rule \"FileCreate\". The \"file\" path shows where the file was created.\n\nLooking at all these events, I notice that they're all generated by the same process, SDXHelper.exe. This seems to be creating multiple files in different locations within the user's AppData directory. For example, there are files like hr-hr-ui-strings-json and icon_built_in_svg_icon_d92d9c61a31aac539c90417dbdb34416.js being created.\n\nFirst, I should consider what SDXHelper.exe is. I recall that this might be related to Microsoft Office, possibly part of the Office Solution Packages used for customizations or add-ins. These packages often contain various resources like JavaScript files and icons needed for user interface elements. So, if the system is installing or updating these resources, it's normal for multiple files to be created during this process.\n\nEach file path ends with a unique hash-like string, which suggests that each is a specific resource being loaded. The repetition of creating the same files (like seeing two entries for hr-hr-ui-strings-json) could indicate either duplication in logging or perhaps an error where the same file is written more than once. However, without more context on whether this activity is expected during normal operations, it's hard to say.\n\nI also notice that some of these events are pointing to different package directories under SolutionPackages, like 36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b and f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2. This could mean that multiple packages are being processed, each creating their own set of files.\n\nNow, considering the classification options: \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". Since all these events are from a legitimate Microsoft process and involve standard file creation during what appears to be normal operation (like resource installation), there's no immediate sign of malicious activity. There's no evidence of access to sensitive files, unusual paths, or multiple failed attempts that might indicate an attack.\n\nThe confidence level is based on the fact that SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process related to Office, and the file operations are typical for such processes. Unless there's an unusual number of events beyond what's expected during installation or update, which isn't indicated here, these events don't raise red flags.\n\nTherefore, the batch as a whole doesn't seem interesting from a security investigation standpoint because they align with normal system behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to legitimate file creation activities by SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Microsoft Office solutions.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is \"EXCEL.EXE\" and the task is a registry value being set. That seems repetitive—seven times in total. Excel doing some registry changes isn't unusual because software often modifies system settings during installation or updates. However, if this happened without any prior user action or over a short period, it might be suspicious, but since I don't have context on when these events occurred, I'll note them as possibly normal.\n\nNext, there are several entries from \"SDXHelper.exe\". This process is associated with Microsoft Office's language packs and updates. The tasks here are file creations in specific paths under the user's AppData directory. These files look like JavaScript resource files for different languages (like kok-in-ui-strings-json), which aligns with how Office handles internationalization. Multiple instances of file creation might be due to an update or installation process. Again, this seems within normal operating parameters.\n\nConsidering all events together, both processes are part of legitimate software operations. The repetition in EXCEL.EXE's registry writes and SDXHelper.exe's file creations don't indicate any obvious malicious activity. There's no evidence of unusual file paths, access to restricted areas, or other red flags typically associated with cyber threats.\n\nTherefore, while monitoring such activities is good practice, especially if they occur unexpectedly, the events as a whole don't raise concerns. They seem consistent with normal user activity and software updates.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of repetitive registry modifications by Excel.exe and file creation activities by SDXHelper.exe related to Microsoft Office language resources, which are typical and not indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the JSONL format has one event per line. The first event is a bit odd because both \"process\" and \"winlog\" are null except for the task being \"None\". That might be an error or just noise, but I'll keep that in mind.\n\nThen, there's an event where \"SDXHelper.exe\" creates a file at a specific path. The path looks legitimate, part of Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages and OfflineFiles directories. So, that seems normal unless it's unexpected behavior, which I'm not sure about yet.\n\nNext, I see multiple events from \"EXCEL.EXE\". Each one is a registry value being set. Excel doing registry writes isn't unusual since applications often modify the registry for settings or preferences. But looking at how many times this happens—over 20 instances—it seems excessive. That raises a red flag because an application shouldn't need to write to the registry that many times in quick succession unless something is wrong.\n\nI'm thinking about what could cause Excel to set so many registry values. It might be a bug, but more concerningly, it could indicate malicious activity like a persistence mechanism or data exfiltration attempts using the registry as a means to store information. Alternatively, it could be part of some exploit where the attacker is using Excel's process to perform actions on the system.\n\nAnother angle is to consider if these activities correlate with user behavior. If someone was actively using Excel and saving settings, maybe multiple writes make sense. But without context, such as timestamps or other related events, it's hard to say. The volume alone suggests something unusual.\n\nSo, putting it all together: one process creating a file that seems legitimate but is followed by an excessive number of registry write operations from Excel. This combination makes the batch interesting because while each event on its own might not be suspicious, the sheer number and context (Excel making so many changes) could indicate something malicious or at least deserving of closer investigation.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" with a high confidence level because the repetitive registry writes are a strong indicator that something isn't right. However, I should also consider the possibility that it's just normal operation gone wrong or an error on the system. Without more data, like additional logs or context about user activity, it's safer to flag this for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry write operations by EXCEL.EXE which may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

It could be part of its normal operation when handling language packages or updates, but the number of events is quite high. Also, all these writes are happening to specific paths within the user's AppData directory.\n\nThere's also one event from \"EXCEL.EXE\" modifying a registry value.
