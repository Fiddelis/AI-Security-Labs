{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's see what each event is about and how they might connect.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe. It starts with Image loaded, then there are Network connections detected, Process accesses, terminations, and file creations\/deletions. This seems normal because Edge updates are pretty common, but the repeated process terminations and network activity could be something to look into.\n\nThen there's RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That's standard for some Windows processes, so probably not malicious on its own. The FileCreate events from winlogbeat.exe might just be the log utility creating files, which is expected behavior.\n\nI also see powershell.exe being accessed but no execution details, and CompatTelRunner.exe querying DNS. These could be red flags if they're part of a larger pattern, like script execution or communication with external servers.\n\nThe FileDeleteDetected event for MicrosoftEdgeUpdate might indicate some file was removed, which is concerning. However, without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious. But the combination of multiple Edge Update activities and deletions could be suspicious.\n\nOverall, while most events are normal, the repeated Edge updates and the deletion suggest potential malicious activity. The confidence isn't very high because there's no clear indication of harm, but there's enough unusual behavior to merit investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events related to MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and file operations that could indicate suspicious activity. There are repeated terminations and network connections for the Edge update process, along with a file deletion event.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of events to analyze. Let me go through each one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: It's chrome.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because Chrome often tweaks the registry for settings or extensions. Next, there's a file created in Windows Update logs, which is standard system behavior. Then again, another chrome.exe registry write. I'm noticing a lot of these from chrome.exe—maybe it's just updating its settings.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a new config file. That makes sense if it's part of the log management setup. More chrome.exe events follow, some with DNS queries. Browsing would naturally trigger DNS lookups, so that's not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen I see msedge.exe writing to the registry—similar to Chrome, Edge does this too. The next few events are about MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating processes and loading images. This seems related to background updates for Edge, which is normal. There are several instances of ImageLoad and ProcessCreate, but they're all within the expected scope of software updates.\n\nI also notice some network activity in the Edge update process, with a ping command. That's typical when checking for updates or communicating with servers. The file creations under WindowsUpdate logs continue, which is standard system logging behavior.\n\nOverall, all these events are related to normal application operations—browsers updating their settings, edge updates running, and log files being created. There's nothing here that stands out as malicious or unusual. The repeated registry writes and process creations don't indicate any irregular patterns beyond what's expected from ongoing software activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as browser updates, Windows update logs creation, and application processes. No signs of malicious behavior detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an updater.exe creating a pipe. That seems normal since it's part of Google Chrome's update process. Next, the same updater is run with various command-line arguments pointing to standard paths and databases. No red flags here; that's typical for legitimate updates.\n\nThen I see svchost.exe being launched multiple times with different parameters. Svchost is a common Windows process used by services, so seeing it create processes under LocalSystemNetworkRestricted or LocalServiceNetworkRestricted is normal. Those are standard service configurations.\n\nA services.exe entry and a special logon event follow. Services.exe is part of the system's service control manager, which handles starting and stopping services. Special logon usually refers to non-interactive sessions, like those for services, so that's not suspicious.\n\nThere are several network connection detections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome making multiple network connections is expected as it loads various resources. Svchost connecting might be part of background service activities, nothing unusual here.\n\nA file creation event by winlogbeat.exe seems related to log management—probably creating a config file for the logging tool, which is standard behavior. The WindowsUpdate logs being created are also normal during update processes.\n\nMultiple registry value sets from chrome.exe could be setting preferences or tracking usage, typical of browser activity. Image loads of system DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are part of normal operations; these are used for anti-malware scanning interface and Windows Defender features.\n\nFinally, Explorer.EXE modifying the registry is standard as it interacts with shell extensions and other components. The last event shows Chrome starting up normally without any irregular command-line arguments.\n\nLooking at all events together, there's nothing that stands out as malicious or unusual. All processes are legitimate, network activities are expected, and file\/registry operations align with normal system behavior. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of standard system processes like Chrome updates, service host creations, network connections, and log file creation.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: It's from MicrosoftEdge_X64.exe, and it says a file was created in the EdgeUpdate Install directory. The path looks normal—something like setup.exe being created is typical during updates or installations. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nSecond event: Again, same process name but this time the task is about changing the file creation time. That's a bit odd because why would you change the timestamp of a file? Maybe it's trying to hide activity by altering logs, which could be malicious. But I need to see more events to be sure.\n\nThird event: Now it's setup.exe creating a named pipe. Named pipes are used for inter-process communication, but if this is part of an update process, that makes sense. Still, I'm keeping an eye on whether there are too many unusual pipes or unexpected connections.\n\nFourth event: The file creation is from winlogbeat.exe in the Windows Logs directory. That's a log management tool; it's standard for such tools to create files. However, sometimes malicious software also logs its actions, so it's worth noting but not necessarily concerning yet.\n\nFifth event: Another setup.exe event, this time creating another file. But wait, the path here is inside the Windows Logs folder. That seems out of place because setup.exe typically runs from an update directory, not a log directory. Maybe it's trying to write logs or persistence mechanisms there.\n\nPutting all together: The first two events are related to EdgeUpdate and involve creation\/change in file times. Then we have setup.exe creating a pipe and another file. The winlogbeat event is normal unless the path is unexpected. The fifth event stands out because setup.exe writing to Windows Logs could indicate tampering or an attempt to hide files there.\n\nI'm concerned that changing file timestamps and writing to log directories might be part of a larger malicious activity, like log tampering or persistence. There's enough here to suggest possible suspicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple events related to Microsoft Edge updates and unusual file creation activities in the Windows Logs directory, which could indicate potential log tampering or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
