The fact that it's creating multiple files in a node_modules directory suggests this could be related to installing or updating dependencies in a Node.js project, perhaps during a development workflow.

So, the user has given me a series of JSONL logs where each line represents an event. Each event shows that git.exe created a file in a specific path.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the common elements across all these events. The process name is consistently git.exe, which is a known tool for version control. That doesn't immediately raise any red flags because git is commonly used by developers and isn't typically associated with malicious activities.\n\nNext, the task is labeled as \"File created\" with the rule \"FileCreate\". This indicates that each event is related to the creation of a file. It's straightforward and part of normal operations when files are being generated or modified during development work.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all reside under the same directory: C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\. The fact that these are TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) tells me they're likely part of a project using Node.js and tools like Cypress for testing. These types of files are standard in such environments, generated to provide type information for JavaScript\/TypeScript projects.\n\nThe pattern here is repetitive—each event creates one of these .d.ts files. Since all the events share the same process name, task, and similar file paths, it seems like a legitimate operation during development or when building the project. There's no variation in the file names that would suggest something out of place, nor are there any indicators of unusual access times or multiple writes to the same file.\n\nI also consider whether such events could be indicative of malicious activity. Typically, malicious actors wouldn't create so many specific .d.ts files across a consistent path structure using git.exe. Instead, they might use more covert methods or different processes to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is that all these files are being created by the same process over a short period. If this were part of a build or setup script, it's normal for multiple files to be generated in quick succession. This doesn't align with common attack vectors like file injection or unauthorized access patterns.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, since everything points to standard development activities and there are no anomalies or deviations from expected behavior, I'd rate the confidence high that this batch isn't interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creation by git.exe in a typical development environment, indicating normal activity rather than malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

My job is to analyze all these events together and decide if this batch is something that needs investigation or not.\n\nLooking at each line, they're all similar. Each event has three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file path details. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\". The Windows log task mentions a file creation event under the rule \"FileCreate\". The file paths are all within a user's Downloads folder, specifically in a directory related to a course called \"Qualidade de Software\" from Inatel. The files being created are various .d.ts files located inside the node_modules folder of a Cypress project.\n\nFirst, I notice that all events involve git.exe creating files. This suggests it's part of a version control system process, possibly during a checkout or sync operation. The fact that they're creating multiple files in a node_modules directory is typical for npm packages, especially with tools like Cypress which rely on typescript definitions (.d.ts).\n\nI should consider if this activity is normal. Git is commonly used in development environments, and it's standard for it to interact with file systems when pulling updates or initializing repositories. The presence of these .d.ts files indicates that TypeScript is being used, which aligns with modern web development practices.\n\nAre there any red flags? The paths seem legitimate—nothing related to known malicious directories or unusual naming conventions. The user account (fiddelis) appears to be a standard username. The fact that multiple files are being created in sequence might indicate a script running during a build or setup process, which is normal for developers.\n\nI should also think about the frequency of these events. If this were part of an automated deployment pipeline, it's not unusual to have multiple file creations at once. Without additional context like timestamps indicating rapid-fire writes or access from unexpected locations, there doesn't seem to be a cause for alarm.\n\nAnother point is that all actions are under the same process and user, so there's no indication of lateral movement or privilege escalation. The file paths don't suggest exfiltration of sensitive data or creation of hidden files; they're all within the project's node_modules directory.\n\nIn summary, these events look like standard operations related to a developer setting up or updating their environment with Cypress and TypeScript.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch as a whole to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each log entry contains. They all have three main parts: process information, Windows log details, and file information.\n\nLooking at the process field, every event shows \"git.exe\" as the name. That tells me that the Git executable is involved in these events. Since Git is a version control system often used by developers for managing code repositories, this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, the Windows log indicates that each event is related to a file creation (rule: FileCreate). So, it's logging that a new file was created. The path provided in each file entry seems to be within a specific directory structure. \n\nThe file paths all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\" and vary by the filename, like \"last.d.ts\", \"lastIndexOf.d.ts\", etc. These look like TypeScript definition files for Lodash's functional programming utilities. Lodash is a JavaScript library used for utility functions, and it's commonly included in Node.js projects.\n\nGiven that all these files are being created under the node_modules folder, which is typical in Node.js or npm-based projects, this suggests that Git might be cloning or updating a repository, installing dependencies, or running some build process. Cypress is an automated testing tool for web applications, often used with Node.js, so it makes sense that the node_modules directory would include Cypress and its type definitions.\n\nThe repetition of similar events—each one creating a file under the same structure but different filenames—is something I should consider. It could be part of a normal installation or update process, especially if someone is working on a project using Git. However, since all these files are related to development tools, there's no immediate indication of malicious activity.\n\nI also notice that each event has the same process name and log task. This consistency makes me think it's a legitimate operation rather than something suspicious. If this were an attack, I'd expect more varied activities across different processes or file locations.\n\nThere's nothing in these logs that stands out as unusual behavior. No signs of privilege escalation, unauthorized access attempts, or creation of unexpected files outside the project structure.

The filename is \"startCase.d.ts\". Hmm, .d.ts files are TypeScript declaration files, which usually define types and interfaces. They're part of the build process for TypeScript projects.\n\nThe second event repeats with another file: \"startsWith.d.ts\".

Let me start by looking at each event one by one and then see if there's a pattern or anything that stands out when considering them all together.\n\nEach JSON object represents an event where the task is \"File created\" by the process named \"git.exe\". The file paths are all located under different subdirectories within \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\". The filenames vary, but they all end with \".d.ts\", which I know is a TypeScript declaration file extension.\n\nSo, first off, the process name being \"git.exe\" suggests that Git-related activities are happening on this system. It's common for developers to use Git for version control, especially in projects that involve Node.js and npm packages since node_modules are typically managed with npm or Yarn, which can interact with Git repositories.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within the \"node_modules\" directory, which is a standard location for storing third-party libraries in Node.js applications. The \"cypress\" folder indicates that this might be related to testing frameworks since Cypress is commonly used for frontend testing.\n\nThe specific files being created are TypeScript declaration files (\".d.ts\") for various functions like \"propOr\", \"property\", etc., which suggests that these are part of the Lodash library. Lodash is a widely-used utility library in JavaScript and Node.js, so it's not unusual to see its types being added during development.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: they're all from the same process (git.exe), occurring in a predictable location related to a project's dependencies, and involve creating type declaration files for a well-known library. This doesn't seem out of the ordinary for a system where developers are working with JavaScript or TypeScript projects. \n\nI should also consider whether these events could indicate malicious activity. Since Git is a legitimate tool used in software development, it's not typically associated with malware. The creation of type files under node_modules is part of standard build processes when using tools like npm install or yarn add, which download and extract package contents.\n\nAnother angle to check is the frequency of these events. If this is happening once during setup or after a package update, it's normal. There's no indication here of an unusual spike in file creation that might suggest something malicious, like rapid file writes across multiple directories or hidden files.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the timestamps (though not provided) would help determine if these events occurred within a short period, which could be suspicious. But since all events are about creating specific type files under node_modules, it's likely part of the package installation process.\n\nPotential red flags might include unknown processes accessing these directories or attempts to modify sensitive system files, but here everything points to standard development activities.\n\nIn conclusion, analyzing this batch as a whole doesn't reveal any signs of malicious behavior.

The file names vary, but they all seem to be related to different methods provided by Lodash's functional programming utilities.\n\nSince these events are about creating files during development, it's pretty standard when someone is setting up or modifying their project structure. It doesn't seem unusual because developers often work with such files when integrating libraries like Cypress and Lodash. The fact that they're all created in one go might indicate a script running as part of the build process or an installation step.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here, like unknown processes accessing sensitive areas, multiple failed login attempts, or unexpected file deletions or modifications. These are straightforward file creation events from a known development tool (git.exe) in a common project setup.

Each event is a JSON object representing a file creation by the process git.exe in Windows. The files being created are all .d.ts files located under the node_modules directory within a Cypress types folder.\n\nFirst, I recognize that git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially with Node.js projects where npm packages like Cypress are managed. The path includes \"node_modules\", which typically houses third-party libraries in a Node.js project.\n\nThe files created all end with .d.ts, which stands for declaration TypeScript files. These are part of TypeScript's type system and don't contain executable code but rather metadata about types. They're usually generated during development or when building the project.\n\nLooking at the specific files being created—like \"useWith.d.ts\", \"values.d.ts\"—they all relate to lodash functions, specifically in a functional programming (fp) context. Lodash is a popular JavaScript library for utility functions, and having type definitions for it makes sense in a TypeScript environment.\n\nThe repetition of similar file creation events with varying filenames suggests that this might be part of the build process or an npm install operation where new packages are being added or existing ones are being updated. This isn't unusual behavior when working with development tools like git and npm.\n\nSince all these files are under node_modules, it's likely a legitimate activity during software development. There's no indication of any suspicious paths or activities outside the norm for a developer environment. No signs of file deletions, access to sensitive areas, or attempts at executing code beyond what's typical in such contexts.\n\nTherefore, while each individual event is a file creation, collectively they don't raise red flags.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. All of them have the same structure, so let me parse one to understand what's going on.\n\nThe first event has \"process\": {\"name\":\"git.exe\"}, which tells me that git.exe was involved. The \"winlog\" field says it's a file creation event with a specific rule. The file path is long but seems to be under the node_modules folder for cypress, specifically within lodash files like zipWith.d.ts and others.\n\nLooking at all events, they're all from the same process (git.exe) creating files in the same directory structure. The paths are variations of different .d.ts files under cypress\/types\/lodash. This seems repetitive but consistent—each event is a new file being created by git.exe in that specific location.\n\nNow, considering the context, node_modules folders typically contain third-party libraries used by applications, especially in JavaScript or TypeScript environments. Cypress is a testing tool, so it's common to have its types defined here. The .d.ts files are TypeScript declaration files which define interfaces and types for static analysis.\n\nSo why is git.exe creating these files? Git can be used for various operations beyond just version control, like cloning repositories or managing submodules. When you clone a repository that includes node_modules, git might create those files as part of the checkout process. Alternatively, it could be part of installing dependencies via npm\/yarn where types are being generated or extracted.\n\nI don't see any signs of suspicious activity here. The paths are standard and expected when dealing with development tools and libraries. There's no indication of file creation in unusual directories, access to sensitive files, or other red flags like multiple processes writing to the same location quickly, which might suggest a race condition or tampering.\n\nThe repetition is normal because it's likely that several files were created during the setup or update of the project dependencies.

That makes me think this might be related to some development activity. Maybe someone is working on a project using Cypress for testing and Lodash for utility functions. It seems pretty standard since developers often use these tools.\n\nEach event is creating a file with a .d.ts extension, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files. These are usually generated by the compiler and don't contain code that's executed directly. So they're more about type definitions than actual runtime behavior.\n\nSince all events are from git.exe, it suggests that Git is cloning or pulling a repository, and these files are being added to the local directory. There's nothing unusual in the actions described—no signs of file deletions, unauthorized access, or other suspicious activities. \n\nI'm also considering whether this could be part of some malicious behavior. However, creating many files with .d.ts extensions doesn't align with common attack vectors I know.

Let me look at the data provided.\n\nEach event is a JSON object with three main parts: process info, windows log details, and file information. The process name is always \"git.exe\", which suggests that Git is being used here. The task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so it's about creating files. The file paths all start with a specific user directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software, followed by node_modules and then various types of files related to Cypress and lodash.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about what Git does when it's used in such contexts. When you work on a project with Git, especially if you're using tools like npm or yarn for managing dependencies (as indicated by the presence of node_modules), Git might track changes in the repository. The files being created here are TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) for Lodash functions.\n\nNow, seeing multiple file creation events from git.exe could be normal during development. When someone is adding new files to their project or modifying existing ones, Git's activity would include creating these files as part of its tracking process. It doesn't seem unusual that a developer would have several .d.ts files being created under node_modules, especially if they're integrating or updating Lodash types.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether these file creations are part of an automated build process. Many CI\/CD pipelines run Git commands and might check out code, install dependencies, which could trigger the creation of these files automatically. Since all events have the same task and similar paths, it's likely a consistent action taken during development or deployment.\n\nI'm also wondering if there's any indication of malicious behavior here. The process is git.exe, which is a legitimate tool. The files being created are standard TypeScript definitions for Lodash functions, which are widely used in JavaScript\/TypeScript projects. There's no sign of executables, changes to system files, or other red flags that might indicate malware activity.\n\nAdditionally, the file paths point to a user's personal directory (C:\\Users\\fiddelis...), suggesting this is happening on an individual's machine rather than a server or network resource. Malicious actors often target high-value assets, not necessarily individual development environments unless they're part of a larger attack campaign.\n\nConsidering all these points, it seems that the batch represents normal activity during software development. The repeated file creation events are expected when working with Git and managing project dependencies. There's no evidence of unauthorized access or malicious code execution; instead, this looks like standard build and test processes in a development environment.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal file creation activities during software development using Git and managing project dependencies.

The first thing I notice is that all the events have the same structure: they're generated by \"git.exe\", and each one reports a file creation under different paths in a node_modules folder for cypress and lodash.\n\nLet me break down what each part means. The process name being \"git.exe\" suggests these are actions taken during a git operation, maybe a clone or pull. The winlog task is about creating files, which seems normal when using version control systems as they often create new files or directories.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to specific TypeScript definition files (d.ts) inside the node_modules directory of a cypress package. This makes sense if someone is setting up a development environment with these tools. The repetition of similar filenames like keyBy.d.ts, keys.d.ts, etc., indicates that multiple files are being created in quick succession.\n\nNow, considering this from a cybersecurity perspective, individual file creation events aren't usually suspicious on their own, especially when coming from git.exe during normal operations. However, the batch consists entirely of these file creations without any other related activities like process spawns or access patterns that could indicate malicious behavior.\n\nI also note that all events are consistent and don't show signs of anomalies such as unexpected processes or unusual access times. The user is \"fiddelis\", which seems like a standard username, and the directory structure appears to be part of a typical project setup on Windows.\n\nTherefore, while each file creation event is benign, looking at them together doesn't raise any red flags.

That's interesting because Git is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments. So it's not unusual to see Git-related processes creating files, especially if someone is working on a project that involves node_modules, which are typical in JavaScript or TypeScript projects.\n\nLooking at the \"winlog\" field, every event has a task of \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This tells me that each event is related to the creation of a file. The rule specified suggests it's part of some monitoring or logging policy set up on the system to track when files are created.\n\nThe \"file\" path in each event points to different .d.ts files located in the node_modules directory under cypress and lodash. Specifically, paths like mean.d.ts, meanBy.d.ts, etc., which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files for Lodash utility functions. These files are standard in projects that use TypeScript and import lodash for type safety.\n\nNow, considering all these events together, they all stem from the same process (git.exe) creating multiple .d.ts files in a node_modules folder. This is a common occurrence when installing or updating npm packages, especially with tools like yarn or npm install, which often clone repositories that include such types.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The consistent naming pattern and the fact that all events are tied to Git's process suggest it's part of normal software development activities. There's no indication of unusual file creation times, access patterns, or locations outside typical project structures. Also, these files are expected in a Cypress setup with TypeScript.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any potential for misuse. Since Git can be used both for legitimate and malicious purposes, but in this context, the presence of node_modules and standard .d.ts files makes it more likely to be benign.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while each individual event might not raise flags on their own, the entire batch doesn't indicate any suspicious behavior.

So, it seems like this is tracking when files are being created on the system. The paths provided all lead to TypeScript definition files (d.ts) inside a node_modules folder for Cypress and lodash. That's a bit technical, but I know that node_modules is where npm packages are stored, so these must be part of some JavaScript or TypeScript project dependencies.\n\nPutting this together, each event is git.exe creating a file in the node_modules directory.

The task under winlog is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The file paths all point to different .d.ts files within a cypress node_modules directory on a user's machine.\n\nFirst, I recognize that git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments. The fact that it's creating multiple files in the node_modules folder suggests this might be part of a build or setup process for a project using tools like npm or yarn. Node_modules is a standard directory in JavaScript and Node.js projects where third-party libraries are stored.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all end with .d.ts, which stands for \"TypeScript declaration files.\" These files provide type information for TypeScript projects and are typically generated automatically by tools during compilation. The presence of multiple such files being created could indicate that a project is being built or modules are being installed.\n\nThe consistency in the process name and task suggests this is part of a routine operation rather than something malicious, which often varies more in patterns. There's no indication of unusual access times, multiple failed attempts, or other red flags typically seen in suspicious activities.\n\nI also consider that node_modules can sometimes be a target for attacks if there are vulnerabilities in the packages, but in this case, it's about creating declaration files, which is a normal part of the build process. The user's directory path includes \"S206 - Qualidade de Software,\" which seems to be an academic course, so this might just be a student setting up a project.\n\nAnother point is that these events are all file creation events.

All events are from the same user and relate to the same project. There's no evidence of unusual processes, failed operations, or access from unknown locations. The file paths are straightforward and within expected directories for a development setup.\n\nCould this be part of an automated script or CI\/CD pipeline? It's possible that these files were created as part of installing dependencies or during a build process triggered by Git. In such cases, multiple files being created in quick succession isn't unusual.\n\nI should consider if there are any red flags. Since all events are file creations and involve known legitimate processes (Git and node_modules), it doesn't seem suspicious on the surface. There's no indication of privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or attempts to modify sensitive areas outside the project directory.\n\nHowever, sometimes attackers might use legitimate tools like Git for malicious activities, but in this case, the actions are consistent with normal development operations. The file paths don't suggest any deviation from expected behavior, and there's a clear pattern indicating批量文件创建，这可能表明是在安装或更新依赖项时自动执行的步骤。\n\nGiven all these points, it seems that the batch of events doesn't raise any red flags. They appear to be part of standard development processes, specifically related to managing project dependencies with Git and node_modules. There's no evidence of malicious activity or anomalies in the logs provided.\n\nSo, after analyzing the entire batch, I conclude that this isn't particularly interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. The activities are within expected bounds for a typical software development environment.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is normal during development or dependency installations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. So, there are four JSON objects here, each representing an event. The common thread I see is that all these events are generated by \"git.exe\". That tells me they're related to Git operations on the system.\n\nEach event has a task labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates that files were created. The file paths point to different .d.ts files inside a node_modules directory, specifically under cypress\/types\/lodash. These are TypeScript definition files for Lodash, which is a utility library often used in JavaScript and TypeScript projects.\n\nSince all these events are happening during Git operations and they're creating necessary files for a development environment, it seems pretty standard. I don't see any signs of malicious activity here—nothing like file deletions, unauthorized access attempts, or creation of hidden files.\n\nThe fact that the same process is creating multiple files in a predictable location makes me confident this isn't suspicious. It looks like part of the setup or update process for a development toolchain, which is common in environments using Git and Node.js.\n\nI don't see any red flags such as unexpected file paths, access times outside normal hours, or deviations from typical user behavior. The files are all under a well-known module structure within node_modules, which is expected when packages like Cypress and Lodash are being managed.\n\nSo, considering the entire batch, there's no indication of malicious intent. These events fit a routine development setup scenario.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Git creating standard TypeScript definition files during normal development operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's look at what each event says.\n\nEach line starts with \"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"}, which tells me that the process involved here is git.exe. Git is a version control system, commonly used for code repositories, so it's not inherently malicious. Then there's the \"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)}\" part, indicating that a file was created. That makes sense when you're working with Git, as it might be updating or creating files in your project.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with C:\\Users\\... and then go into a directory named \"node_modules\", which is a common folder in Node.js projects where libraries are stored. The specific files being created are under cypress and lodash directories. Cypress is a testing tool for web applications, and Lodash is a utility library in JavaScript. So these are all standard files you'd expect to see when someone is setting up or working on a project that uses these tools.\n\nSince all the events show git.exe creating files within expected locations related to a development environment, there doesn't seem to be any unusual activity here. No signs of file creation in system directories, no hidden files, and nothing outside of what you'd expect from a developer's workflow. It looks like someone is just cloning or updating their repository and installing dependencies.\n\nI'm not seeing any red flags such as multiple failed attempts, access to sensitive areas, or inconsistencies with user activity. The repetition of file creation events could be part of an automated process, which is normal in development environments, especially when using tools like Git and npm (Node Package Manager) for installing packages.\n\nSo overall, this batch doesn't indicate any malicious behavior. It's just a developer setting up their environment or working on their project normally.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating files in a node_modules directory as part of a development environment, which is normal and expected behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
