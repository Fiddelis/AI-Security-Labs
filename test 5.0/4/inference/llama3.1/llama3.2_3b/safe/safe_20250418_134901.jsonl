Each event is represented by a dictionary with several key-value pairs.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the keys and values:\n\n* `process`: This key contains information about the process that triggered the event.\n\t+ `name`: The name of the process (e.g., \"winlogbeat.exe\", \"svchost.exe\")\n* `winlog`: This key contains information about the Windows Event Log event.\n\t+ `task`: The type of task that triggered the event (e.g., \"Process Create\", \"File created\", \"Registry value set\")\n\t+ Other keys may be present depending on the specific event, such as `rule` or `provider`\n* `file`: This key contains information about a file related to the event. If no file is involved, this key will be null.\n\t+ `path`: The path of the file (if applicable)\n\nSome examples of events:\n\n1. A new process was created:\n```\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"winlogbeat.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"},\"file\":null}\n```\n\n2. A file was created:\n```\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"svchost.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new\"}}\n```\n\n3. A registry value was set:\n```\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"svchost.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"},\"file\":null}\n```"}
