This repeated activity by a single process raises suspicion, especially if the process isn't commonly recognized.\n\n2. **Duplicate File Paths**: Some files are created more than once with identical paths and names but different hashes. In legitimate scenarios, duplicate file creations should not occur unless explicitly intended for redundancy or backup.\n\n3. **Unique Hashes**: Each JavaScript file has a unique hash, suggesting that they might be dynamically generated or altered versions of scripts, which is often associated with obfuscation or malicious code injection attempts.\n\n4. **Location and Naming Convention**: The files are created in an unusual directory structure related to Microsoft Office's Solution Packages. This indicates potential tampering or exploitation targeting Office applications.\n\nGiven these factors, the events collectively suggest a pattern that merits further investigation to rule out any malicious intent."}
