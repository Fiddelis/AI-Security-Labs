Additionally, the 'Image loaded' event where 'amsi.dll' is loaded into 'chrome.exe' is suspicious as it may suggest attempts to bypass antivirus defenses. The creation of 'svchost.exe' processes with specific service names ('NgcSvc' and 'NgcCtnrSvc') could be indicative of malicious activity since these are not standard Windows services.
