{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' performing suspicious activities such as creating files and setting registry values are present, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Suspicious Process Usage**:\n   - The process `powershell.exe` is frequently involved in various tasks (file creation and registry changes), which could indicate it's being used for scripting potentially malicious activities.\n   \n2. **Registry Changes**:\n   - Multiple entries show that `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` are setting registry values, which can be a technique used by malware to maintain persistence or change system configurations.\n\n3. **Repeated File Creation**:\n   - The event involving `winlogbeat.exe` creating the same file twice at the same path might suggest unusual activity, possibly indicating an attempt to modify or replace configuration files.\n\n4. **Non-Interactive Profile**:\n   - The creation of a file in the `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` directory by `powershell.exe` is noteworthy because it suggests potential persistence mechanisms through startup scripts.\n\nGiven these observations, the batch contains patterns that are often associated with malicious behavior and thus warrants further investigation. The confidence level reflects the strong indicators present but leaves room for additional context or data that might affect the final assessment."}
