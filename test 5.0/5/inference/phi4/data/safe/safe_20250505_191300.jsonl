While this might be normal for an application like Discord, a high frequency of such events could indicate unusual activity, potentially signaling data exfiltration or communication with malicious servers.\n   \n2. **File Creation Time Changes**: \n   - There are entries indicating changes in file creation times for files within the `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\discord\\\\Network` directory. Such changes could suggest tampering, potentially as a part of malware activity where files are altered to hide their origins or exfiltrate data.\n\n3. **Registry Event**: \n   - A registry value set event related to Discord.exe can be benign if it's just updating application settings. However, in the context of suspicious network and file activities, it might warrant further investigation as some malware modifies registry entries to ensure persistence.\n\n4. **Process Accesses**:\n   - Multiple `Process accessed` events could indicate attempts to access system resources or modify process behavior, which, depending on their nature, may be associated with malicious intent.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**: \n   - The confidence level is set at 0.75 due to the combination of potentially suspicious activities surrounding network connections and file modifications, but also recognizing that such events might occur in benign contexts within a communication application like Discord. Further investigation would provide clarity on whether these activities are indeed malicious.\n\nOverall, while each individual event could be normal for an application like Discord, the frequency and nature of these specific events together suggest they should be investigated further to rule out any malicious activity."}
