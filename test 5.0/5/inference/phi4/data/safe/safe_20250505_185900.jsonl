{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_185900.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell executions, process creation, and file operations that could indicate script execution or automation activities, which are often associated with malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **PowerShell Executions**: Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` being executed (`command_line` and `name`). PowerShell is a common tool used for legitimate purposes but also by attackers to execute scripts.\n\n2. **Pipe Creation Event**: The event `Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)` involves `powershell.exe`, which might suggest inter-process communication, potentially for malicious coordination or data exfiltration.\n\n3. **Image Load Events**: Loading of `MpClient.dll` and `urlmon.dll` by PowerShell could be suspicious if these files are used in a way that is not typical for regular operations.\n\n4. **Process Creation**: The creation of `ipconfig.exe` with the command line to execute `\/all` might indicate network reconnaissance or information gathering, which can be part of an attack.\n\n5. **File Operations**: A file created by `winlogbeat.exe`, a legitimate tool often used for log shipping, could be benign but warrants attention if it is not typical behavior for this process.\n\nOverall, the combination of these events suggests potential unauthorized activities that merit further investigation to rule out malicious intent. The confidence level reflects the suspicious nature of the batch while acknowledging that these actions can also be part of legitimate administrative tasks."}
