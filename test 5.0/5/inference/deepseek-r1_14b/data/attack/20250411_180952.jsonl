{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is from svchost.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\sru\\SRUtmp.log. I know that svchost.exe is a common system process, often associated with services like Windows Update or event logging. The creation of SRUtmp.log doesn't immediately raise flags because it's part of normal system operations for handling event logs.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping and management, so this seems legitimate. It's probably setting up its configuration file there, which isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the third and fourth events, both are from powershell.exe. The tasks here involve registry value changes and process access. Powershell is a powerful tool often used maliciously, but these specific actions could be part of legitimate administrative tasks or script execution. Without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nConsidering all events together, there's no obvious signs of malicious activity. Each event individually doesn't raise concerns enough on its own, and combined, they don't form a pattern that would warrant immediate investigation. So, I'd classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events include normal system processes (svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe) performing routine tasks such as file creation. Powershell events are generic and do not indicate malicious activity without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where processes like chrome.exe and svchost.exe are making DNS queries and network connections. That seems normal because Chrome does use DNS for browsing and network connections for downloads or streaming.\n\nThen, I see several commands using cmd.exe with net user and net group commands to add users and groups across the domain. This stands out a bit because creating new domain users and adding them to the Domain Admins group can be a sign of privilege escalation. It's concerning if these are being executed without proper authorization.\n\nAlso, there are processes like powershell.exe accessing registry values multiple times. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, but repeated access to registry could indicate malicious activity, such as installing persistent malware or modifying system configurations.\n\nAdditionally, cmd.exe and net.exe commands are creating users and adding them to domain admin groups. This kind of activity can grant attackers high-level permissions, which is a red flag for potential compromise.\n\nThere are also file creation events involving powershell.exe creating files in user directories, which might be part of malicious script execution or storing configurations.\n\nLastly, some events like conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files seem less concerning as they could be legitimate system processes or monitoring tools.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of net.exe and cmd.exe for domain-level changes is a significant indicator. The combination of these activities suggests potential unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and possible lateral movement within the network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of creating new domain users and adding them to Domain Admins group via cmd.exe and net.exe commands indicate potential unauthorized access or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
