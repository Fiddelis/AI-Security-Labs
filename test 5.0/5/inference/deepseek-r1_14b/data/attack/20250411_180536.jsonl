{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about tarefa_logico.exe loading a file from C:\\Windows\\assembly... It looks like a legitimate .NET framework file path. Not suspicious yet.\n\nNext, estrutura_principal.exe also loaded something from the .NET Framework directory. Same pattern as before, so probably normal.\n\nThen there are several events involving cmd.exe, conhost.exe, elemento_ativo.exe, modulo_secundario.exe, and others setting registry values. Registry writes can be common, but I should check if these processes typically do this. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory, that makes sense because it's likely writing logs or configuration files. No red flags here.\n\nPowershell.exe shows up multiple times with registry and process access events. Powershell is often used by attackers but can also be legitimate. The fact that there are multiple such events might raise an eyebrow, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere are a few Registry value set tasks from RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, and svchost.exe. These processes do interact with the registry normally, so unless they're accessing unexpected keys, this might not be concerning.\n\nI notice that several events involve file loads (ImageLoad) of urlmon.dll by Calculator.exe and another process. Urlmon is a standard Windows component, so again, not suspicious on its own.\n\nConsidering all these, most activities seem normal except for the multiple powershell.exe instances and some registry writes. However, without evidence of unusual patterns or deviations from baseline activity, it's hard to conclude malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show common system activities such as loading standard system files and legitimate process interactions with the registry, which do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, most of the entries are from 'chrome.exe' with tasks like Dns queries and Network connections. These seem normal because Chrome is a common browser that would make such network requests. I don't see anything unusual here at first glance.\n\nThen there's an entry where both process and winlog are null. Not sure what to make of that, but it might be an error or just incomplete logging. Doesn't raise any red flags yet.\n\nNext up is 'powershell.exe' accessing a process. PowerShell is often used for legitimate admin tasks, but it can also be a vector for attacks. I'll keep this in mind. There's another entry where 'whoami.exe' is run with no command line details. Running whoami might be part of user identification or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nAnother PowerShell event shows registry value set. That could be setting up persistence or making changes to system configurations, which isn't inherently bad but could be malicious if combined with other activities.\n\nThen there's a 'cmd.exe' process creating something using sc.exe. The command line is a bit long and seems like it's creating a service. Services are common for persistence in malware. I should look closer at the commands—using sc.exe to create and start services can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if done from an unexpected script.\n\nAnother cmd.exe sets a registry value, which again could be part of system configuration but might also be setting up something malicious.\n\nMultiple entries from 'services.exe' modifying the registry. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, so seeing it in these logs isn't unusual unless it's doing something out of its normal scope. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks make me think there's a lot of activity here, possibly indicating configuration changes that could be part of an attack.\n\nThere are also several 'sc.exe' create and start commands. Creating services with sc.exe is a common technique for attackers to achieve persistence across reboots. The command lines have paths like \"modulo_geral\" and \"registro_base,\" which seem generic, but they might be customizing the service names or locations.\n\nLooking at the image load events from various processes loading mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, and clr.dll—all related to .NET framework components. This is normal for applications running on .NET, so probably nothing suspicious here unless there's an unusual version or location.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch includes normal activities like browser usage but also several red flags involving PowerShell, cmd.exe, sc.exe, and registry modifications. These could be signs of a potential attack where attackers are using legitimate tools for malicious purposes, setting up services for persistence, and altering system configurations. Given the number of process creations and registry changes, especially with sc.exe, this batch is likely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving PowerShell, cmd.exe, and sc.exe creating services, which may indicate potential malicious activity. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks and process creations are concerning.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
