{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nLooking at the events, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool for administrators but can also be used maliciously. The command lines show various commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', which might be part of reconnaissance activities to gather user information. There's also a call to cmdkey.exe, which could be related to managing cached credentials.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation and deletion events for a script in the Temp directory. This is suspicious because creating and immediately deleting files can be a tactic to avoid detection, often seen in malware or malicious scripts. The file path includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" which doesn't ring any bells as a legitimate process I'm familiar with.\n\nThe logs also show several registry access events and image loading tasks, which might indicate that the script is attempting to execute commands or load certain modules. This kind of activity could be part of malicious behavior trying to establish persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the repeated powershell.exe usage with potentially harmful commands, the file operations in the Temp directory, and the registry activities—it's reasonable to classify this batch as interesting for investigation. There's a clear pattern suggesting possible unauthorized access or malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with potentially malicious command lines, including user enumeration and credential management commands, along with file creation\/deletion in the Temp directory.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. \n\nFirst, I notice multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with a command line that includes several commands like net user, get-localuser, and others. These commands are often used for gathering system information or making changes to user accounts and groups, which can be signs of potential malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the winlog events, there's a mix of Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, Process Create, Image loaded, and so on. The repetition of these events with powershell.exe is concerning because attackers often use PowerShell for executing scripts or commands that can be obfuscated or used to hide malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, some events involve net.exe and net1.exe being called with the 'user' argument. These utilities are typically used for network user management, but when executed without clear context, they might indicate unauthorized access attempts or credential dumping.\n\nThere's also an event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a file. While this could be part of log shipping processes, it's worth noting if this process is legitimate in the environment. Unusual file creation by monitoring tools might warrant closer inspection to ensure there's no tampering or unintended data collection.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repetition of powershell and net commands, combined with various lifecycle and process creation tasks, suggests a pattern that could indicate an active attacker trying to enumerate users, groups, or other system information. This kind of activity is often seen during lateral movement or in the early stages of an attack when adversaries are gathering information about their target.\n\nHowever, it's possible that some of these events are part of legitimate system administration tasks or automated scripts. To be certain, more context would be needed, such as user permissions, time of day, and whether this pattern is typical for the environment.\n\nThe confidence level here is moderate because while there are red flags, there's also a chance these could be benign activities. But given the nature of the commands and their repetition, it's prudent to investigate further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe executions with potentially malicious commands like net user, get-localuser, and others, along with repeated process creations and file operations that may indicate unauthorized system access or data gathering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that there are multiple entries where the process is cmdkey.exe and net.exe being used with command-line arguments like \"\/list\" and \"localgroup\". These commands are typically related to managing user accounts or groups on a system. While these can be legitimate administrative tasks, they might also be signs of someone probing the system's permissions or trying to gather information for an attack.\n\nThen there are several entries involving powershell.exe being accessed and creating files. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but it's also commonly abused in cyberattacks because it allows for script execution and can be used to execute malicious commands. The file paths mentioned, like Downloads\\elemento_logico.txt and AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive, might indicate the creation of scripts or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI also notice that there are multiple Registry value sets from different processes, including conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and svchost.exe. These could be part of legitimate operations, but registry modifications can sometimes be used by malware to maintain persistence between reboots.\n\nLooking at the image loads for urlmon.dll in both Calculator.exe and calc.exe entries makes me think about potential malicious activities because some malware might load components into known processes to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the use of whoami.exe, which typically retrieves user information. If this is part of a script or process that's checking permissions or credentials, it could be an indicator of someone trying to understand the system's access levels.\n\nConsidering all these events together, I'm concerned because there are multiple instances of potentially suspicious activities involving administrative tools and scripts. The repeated use of PowerShell with file creations and registry modifications stands out as particularly concerning. These could be part of an attack chain, such as initial access, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.\n\nWhile each individual event might not necessarily be malicious on its own, the combination suggests a pattern that's worth investigating further. For example, using net.exe for localgroup queries could be normal admin work but might also signal someone trying to gather information about users or groups. The PowerShell activities are especially notable because they can execute code and create files, which is often how attackers leave backdoors or persistence mechanisms.\n\nIn conclusion, the batch shows a series of actions that, when taken together, raise red flags. There's enough here to warrant closer examination to determine if these events indicate malicious behavior or legitimate activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including use of cmdkey.exe, net.exe for group management, PowerShell executions with file creations and registry modifications, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
