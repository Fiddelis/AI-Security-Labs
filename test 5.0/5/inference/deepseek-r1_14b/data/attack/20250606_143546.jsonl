{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice a lot of entries from powershell.exe. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Malware developers like to use it because it can execute scripts and has access to system functions.\n\nLooking deeper, there's a command line in one of the process logs: \"& {import-module \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\\\" try { Invoke-entrada_principal -OutputDirectory $env:Temp } catch { $_; exit $_.Exception.HResult} Start-Sleep 5}\". Hmm, the path looks a bit off with \"unidade_logico\" which translates to \"logical unit\" in Portuguese, maybe trying to look legitimate but could be hiding something malicious. The script is being imported and then there's an Invoke-entrada_principal commandâ€”sounds like it's doing some kind of main function, possibly dropping or executing other code.\n\nAlso, I see that powershell.exe created a file in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1\". Then, just a moment later, it deletes that same file. That's suspicious because creating and then deleting a script file quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection or clean up after executing malicious code.\n\nOther events show powershell.exe accessing various system components like the Registry and loading different DLLs. These activities are common in scripts trying to establish persistence or escalate privileges, which are red flags for potential malware.\n\nAdditionally, there's a process from svchost.exe creating a log file and modifying the registry. Svchost is another common process used by malware since it's a legitimate Windows process that can be easily exploited.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple powershell.exe instances with suspicious command lines, creation\/deletion of a script in Temp, and activity from svchost.exe. These are all signs that could indicate malicious behavior, possibly an attack or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with suspicious command lines and activities, including file creation\/deletion in Temp directory and svchost.exe actions indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. The logs are in JSONL format, each line being a JSON object with process, winlog, and file information.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's 'RuntimeBroker.exe' setting a registry value. Then 'HxTsr.exe' does the same. I know that legitimate processes can modify the registry, but it's something to keep an eye on. Next up is 'svchost.exe', which often runs system services and sometimes gets exploited by malware.\n\nI notice several entries from 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is powerful and commonly used for both good and bad purposes. The event shows a file creation in the user's AppData folder, which could be suspicious if it's creating scripts or other files without user interaction. But sometimes legitimate scripts run during startup.\n\nThen there are multiple 'svchost.exe' entries creating files under C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download... This looks like it's part of Windows Update since that's where the files are being saved. The filenames like UpdateAgent.dll and others seem related to system updates, which is normal behavior. But I should check if these file paths are standard for update processes.\n\nAnother point is 'svchost.exe' loading urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll via ImageLoad events. These DLLs are part of Windows networking components, so this isn't unusual unless there's an irregular number of such events or they're being used in a way that's outside normal operations.\n\nThe last entries involve 'backgroundTaskHost.exe' and 'msedgedriverwebview2.exe', which seem to be legitimate processes loading standard system DLLs. No red flags here.\n\nOverall, while each individual event isn't alarming on its own, the combination shows multiple processes modifying registry values and creating files, especially in areas like Windows Update. This could indicate potential malicious activity trying to blend in with normal operations, or it might just be regular system updates and process behavior. I'm leaning towards 'INTERESTING' because of the volume and specific file interactions but not entirely sure if they're malicious. My confidence is around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes, including svchost.exe and powershell.exe, are creating files in unusual locations and modifying registry values, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL logs here. Each line represents an event with some process information, Windows log task details, and file paths.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from 'svchost.exe' and 'MpSigStub.exe'. Svchost is a common system process, so seeing it in the logs isn't unusual on its own. The tasks associated with it include registry value sets and file creations, particularly in the SoftwareDistribution directory. That seems normal because svchost can be part of Windows updates or servicing.\n\nNext up is 'MpSigStub.exe', which I recognize as related to Microsoft Defender. It's creating several files in the Temp directory with names like AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe and various .vdm files. These look like they could be part of update processes, maybe patching or delta updates. The file paths are standard for temporary files, so this might just be Defender doing its thing.\n\nThen there's 'setup.exe' creating multiple files in the EdgeCore directory. Setup.exe is commonly used during software installations or updates. The specific files like cookie_exporter.exe and identity_helper.exe sound like they're part of setting up Edge components, which again seems legitimate.\n\nI also see entries from 'MsMpEng.exe', which I believe is another component related to Windows Defender. It's loading a DLL, which is normal for such processes.\n\nThere are events involving Registry value sets by 'svchost.exe' and 'RuntimeBroker.exe'. These could be part of system configuration changes or updates, so nothing suspicious there on first glance.\n\nOne event stands out: 'powershell.exe' being accessed. PowerShell can be used both for legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities. However, in this batch, it's just an access event without any command details, so I can't tell if it's good or bad from here alone.\n\nPutting all these together, each process seems to be performing standard operations related to system updates, antivirus processes, and software installations. The file paths are typical for such activities. There's no indication of unusual behavior like multiple failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or unexpected binaries being executed.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING because all the events are within normal operational ranges and don't exhibit signs of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activities related to updates and process initialization.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL data provided, each line represents an event with three components: process, winlog, and file. The majority of these events are from 'svchost.exe' and involve tasks like setting registry values or creating files.\n\nI know that svchost.exe is a common Windows process used by various services. It's not inherently malicious, but it can be a vector for attacks since it runs with system-level privileges. So, any unusual activity here might be concerning.\n\nLooking at the winlog events, most are \"Registry value set\" and a few are \"File created\". The files being created are in locations like C:\\Windows\\Logs\\waasmedic, C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution, and others. These seem to be standard system directories where Windows stores logs and updates.\n\nThe repetitive nature of the events is also something to consider. There are multiple entries with the same task type and file paths. This repetition doesn't immediately raise red flags because svchost.exe does perform routine tasks that involve frequent registry modifications and file creation, especially during updates or maintenance processes.\n\nHowever, I should think about whether these activities deviate from normal behavior. If this is part of a legitimate Windows update process, then it's not suspicious. But if these events are happening outside of an expected update cycle or with unusual files being created, that could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nAnother point is the variety of file paths. They touch on different system areas like Logs and SoftwareDistribution. While some might seem normal, others like 'C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles' could be areas where malicious actors might try to hide their activities. But without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI also notice that in several events, the process is listed as None. That's a bit odd because usually, there would be a process name associated with file creation or registry changes. This could indicate that the event was recorded by something monitoring system calls, but I'm not sure if it's relevant here.\n\nConsidering all these factors: repeated registry modifications and file creations by svchost.exe in standard directories. While not entirely normal, they don't clearly point to malicious activity without more context. However, the volume of such events might be worth investigating to ensure that they're part of legitimate system operations and not an attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from svchost.exe performing routine registry modifications and file creations in standard Windows directories, which are typical for system processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let me look through each event one by one.\n\nThe first log shows whoami.exe being executed. That's pretty normal; it's a common utility to check user information. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext are several events related to powershell.exe. The second event says Process accessed, which might be part of normal operations since PowerShell often interacts with processes. Then there's a Registry value set. Again, PowerShell can do that for various legitimate reasons.\n\nLooking at the third event about creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" using New-Service and starting it. That caught my attention because creating services via PowerShell is common in malware for persistence. It's a red flag because malicious actors often create hidden services to maintain access.\n\nThere are multiple Image Load events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These seem standard as they're part of .NET framework. But the sequence might be normal or could be part of script execution.\n\nThen there's a file created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1. Creating temporary files is normal, but the naming seems arbitrary and could indicate script execution, possibly malicious.\n\nAfter that, the same file is deleted. Deleting temp files isn't unusual, but combined with other actions, it might suggest an attempt to remove traces of a script.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event from powershell.exe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, which can be part of normal operations but sometimes used in command-line attacks.\n\nLooking further down, services.exe is setting multiple registry values. Services.exe is legitimate and manages system services, so this might not be suspicious by itself unless the registry changes are malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The creation of a new service via PowerShell could indicate an attempt to create persistence or install malware. Also, the temporary file created and immediately deleted suggests an attempt to hide activities. While some actions are normal, the combination raises concern about potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell events including creating a service named \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" and deleting a temporary file, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where PowerShell is being executed with specific commands. The command lines show `New-Service` and `Start-Service`, which suggests someone is trying to create or start a service on the system. Repeating these commands several times could indicate attempts to install a malicious service or perhaps legitimate administration tasks.\n\nNext, I notice that some events are labeled as \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\". These are typical Windows Service-related log entries when services start or stop. However, combined with the PowerShell activity, it's worth monitoring if these services are expected or not.\n\nThen there are events where `Execute a Remote Command` is logged, pointing to a specific PowerShell script path: `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1`. The fact that this script is being executed multiple times raises suspicion. It could be part of legitimate software operations, but it's also common for malware to drop scripts in such locations and execute them repeatedly.\n\nI'm concerned about the file paths. `C:\\unidade_logico` translates to \"Logical Unit\" in Portuguese, which might not be standard naming convention for legitimate files or scripts. Malware often uses such names to hide their tracks. The script is referenced multiple times across different log entries, indicating it's being accessed frequently.\n\nThe lack of file information (marked as None) in some events suggests that the logs aren't capturing additional details about these files, which could be intentional to avoid detection or simply a limitation of the logging setup.\n\nPutting this together: repeated attempts to create and start services using PowerShell, combined with multiple executions of a script from an unusual path, are red flags. These activities could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or deploy malicious software on the system. Therefore, this batch should be classified as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands attempting service creation and execution of a script from an unusual path, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. The first few events are all from the same process: tarefa_logico.exe. Each time it loads different DLL files like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. These look like legitimate .NET framework components, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen, moving on to powershell.exe events. There's a file creation event in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That seems normal since PowerShell uses profiles when starting. But I notice some registry value sets tooâ€”again, part of how PowerShell configures itself, probably not malicious.\n\nNext, there are several events where both process and winlog are marked as None. These might be noise or unrelated activities that the logging system picked up but didn't provide useful data on.\n\nThe interesting stuff starts towards the end. Multiple events show a PowerShell command being executed, specifically importing a module from C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. The command tries to invoke Invoke-entrada_principal and has error handling with exit codes. Also, there's a sleep command at the end. This script is attempting some operations, possibly to execute malicious code or perform certain actions.\n\nImportantly, the file paths have backslashes that don't match Windows conventions (using 'unidade_logico' which might not be a standard path), and the use of Invoke-entrada_principal isn't a known legitimate command. Additionally, invoking scripts from untrusted locations and using error handling to suppress output is common in malicious scripts to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the combination of events: multiple attempts to execute the same PowerShell command with potentially harmful intent. This pattern could indicate an attempt to run unauthorized code on the system. The repetition of the command line suggests that it's being executed multiple times or as part of a loop, which might be trying to persist the script or ensure its execution despite failures.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while individual events could be benign, the repetitive and specific nature of these PowerShell commands points towards potential malicious activity. Also, the use of such a specific command (Invoke-entrada_principal) that isn't widely recognized as legitimate adds to the suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show PowerShell executing a script from an unusual path with error handling and persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nLooking at the first event: It has process as None, winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\", and the file path points to 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. Hmm, that's a PowerShell script. I know that executing remote commands can be normal, but if it's done by an unknown process or in large numbers, it might indicate something malicious.\n\nNext, there are several similar events where the same file path is accessed with the same task. That repetition stands out. Also, most of these events have \"Execute a Remote Command\" and point to the same script. I'm wondering if this could be part of an automated process or maybe something more sinister like a script being run multiple times for persistence.\n\nThere are a couple of other events where the process is 'services.exe' with tasks like 'Logon'. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, so those might not be suspicious on their own. But combined with the other events, it's worth noting if these logons coincide with the remote command executions.\n\nI also notice that some events have \"Special Logon\" as the task. Special logons are often associated with system services or background processes, but again, in the context of multiple remote commands, it might be something to look into.\n\nConsidering all the events together: There's a lot of repetition in executing remote commands from the same script path. This could indicate an attempt at lateral movement, data exfiltration, or establishing persistence. The frequency is high, which is concerning because legitimate activities usually don't repeat such actions so many times unless it's part of a scheduled task, but that seems unlikely given the file involved.\n\nThe PowerShell script's path has Portuguese directory names like \"unidade_logico\" and \"registro_secundario\", which translates to \"logical unit\" and \"secondary registry\". That might be just naming conventions, but unusual paths can sometimes be red flags. Additionally, 'componente_auxiliar.ps1' could imply it's a helper script, but without knowing its purpose, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple executions of the same remote command from the same file path, which is a pattern that could indicate malicious activity. There are a couple of other events with services.exe and logon tasks, adding context but not enough on their own. However, when combined, they might suggest unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the repeated remote command executions, especially from a PowerShell script, could be signs of an attack. The confidence is high because while some events aren't alarming, the overall pattern suggests potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of executing a remote command from the same file path indicate potential malicious activity or suspicious patterns that merit further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events that the user provided. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. My job is to determine if this batch as a whole is interesting enough for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, let me parse through each event. The first 14 entries all have similar structures: \"process\" set to None, \"winlog\" with the task being 'Execute a Remote Command', and the file path pointing to the same location, C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. This seems repetitive.\n\nI notice that after these 14 events, there are two more entries where \"winlog\" is related to \"Windows Update Agent\", and one of them has \"process\" as None and the file path also as None. Then, towards the end, there's another event with 'Execute a Remote Command' task pointing to the same script again.\n\nHmm, so why would multiple events point to the same remote command execution? This could indicate legitimate activity, like scheduled tasks or automated processes running scripts. However, repeated executions of a script could also be a sign of malicious behavior, especially if the script is accessing sensitive files or performing actions it shouldn't.\n\nThe fact that all these events are so similar makes me think there's a pattern here. If this were part of normal operations, I'd expect some variation in process names or different file accesses. The repetition might suggest an automated attack or persistence mechanism where the same command is executed multiple times at intervals.\n\nAnother point to consider is the specific file path: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. If this script isn't commonly used on the system, especially if it's part of a known legitimate process, then its repeated execution could be suspicious.\n\nI also note that some events towards the end have different tasks, like \"Windows Update Agent,\" which might be normal, but they don't have associated file paths or processes. This could mean there are other background activities happening alongside the remote command executions.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING.\" The repetitive nature of the events, especially the multiple executions of a single script via remote commands, raises flags for potential malicious activity. While it's possible that these are legitimate operations, the lack of variation and the specific file path make me cautious.\n\nHowever, without more context or additional logs showing what exactly this script does, I can't be certain. My confidence is around 0.7 because there's a significant chance these could be benign activities, but the pattern definitely warrants closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated execution of a remote command pointing to the same script path, suggesting potential malicious activity or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
