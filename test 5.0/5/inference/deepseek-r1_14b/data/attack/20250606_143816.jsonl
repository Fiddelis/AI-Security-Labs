I'm looking at the JSONL data provided.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from powershell.exe. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to keep an eye on. \n\nLooking at the events:\n- There are multiple instances where powershell is accessing processes, loading images, and interacting with files. Specifically, there's a command line in one event that tries to download a script from GitHub. The URL mentioned (https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/...) seems suspicious because it's associated with known malicious scripts like WinPwn, which is often used for lateral movement and privilege escalation.\n\n- Also, there are file creation and deletion events in the Temporary folder. Creating a script file and then deleting it shortly after might be an attempt to avoid detection or persistence.\n\n- Another point is the use of 'whoami.exe', which could be used to gather system information, potentially indicating reconnaissance activities.\n\nConsidering all these together—suspicious command-line arguments, multiple powershell instances, and file operations—it's likely that this batch indicates malicious activity. \n\nI'm confident enough to classify this as interesting because it shows several red flags commonly associated with cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell activities including suspicious command-line arguments, file operations, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an event where svchost.exe set a registry value. That's normal because svchost is a common system process that often interacts with the registry.\n\nNext, sppsvc.exe created a file in the cache directory. Again, this seems typical for software protection services.\n\nThen, whoami.exe was executed. It's a standard tool used by users to check their permissions and usually isn't malicious on its own unless misused in a specific context.\n\nNow, looking at powershell.exe events: there are multiple instances where it's being accessed, files created, images loaded, and even a file deletion. The command line for one of the PowerShell processes shows an attempt to connect to a remote drive using \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\". This is concerning because accessing remote drives can be a sign of lateral movement in an attack.\n\nAlso, there are several file creations and deletions by PowerShell. Notably, a script was created and then deleted shortly after. Such behavior might indicate the execution of malicious scripts that don't want to leave traces, or it could be part of legitimate automated processes. However, combined with the remote drive access, this raises suspicion.\n\nThe frequent registry modifications by PowerShell are another red flag because attackers often use the registry to persistence their malware or modify system configurations.\n\nConsidering all these events together, especially the PowerShell activities that suggest potential unauthorized access and file operations, I believe this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including registry modifications, file creations\/deletions, and suspicious remote drive access indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event.\n\nFirst, there are several events with similar command lines in the process field. They all involve powershell.exe and some complex command-line arguments. The URL mentioned is from GitHub, specifically pointing to a PowerShell script called WinPwn.ps1. I recall that scripts named like this can sometimes be malicious or used for penetration testing. The path seems suspicious because it's directly downloading a script from a public repository.\n\nThe first set of events has the same command line where they're executing this script with parameters like -noninteractive and -consoleoutput. The task in winlog is either 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle', which are related to PowerShell's own processes but might indicate something unusual if repeated so many times.\n\nThen, there's a second set of events where the command line changes slightly. It's using New-PSDrive with parameters that seem like they're trying to map a drive to a remote location (\\\\Target\\\\C$). This is a common tactic in attacks to access remote systems or pivot within a network. The fact that it's done multiple times could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or lateral movement.\n\nLooking at all these events together, the repeated downloading of the same script and the subsequent drive mapping commands suggest a potential attack. The use of powershell.exe is common in both legitimate scripting and malicious activities because it has built-in cmdlets that can access system functionalities. The fact that multiple instances are happening with similar patterns might indicate an automated or scripted attack.\n\nAnother thing to note is that some events have slightly different winlog tasks, which could be part of the process creation and execution flow. If all these events happened within a short timeframe, it would raise suspicion as it's unlikely for a user to execute so many powershell commands in quick succession unless something is automated or malicious.\n\nI'm also considering the confidence level. While each individual event might not be conclusive on its own, the combination of multiple similar and potentially malicious activities makes this batch more likely to be interesting. However, without additional context like timestamps or user information, it's hard to be 100% certain, but given the indicators, I'd say there's a high probability that these events are worth investigating.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch is classified as INTERESTING because of repeated suspicious powershell activity indicating potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell command executions and file operations indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the first event has a process command line that looks suspicious. It's using powershell.exe with some arguments: New-PSDrive, which creates a new PowerShell drive. The parameters are -name g, which probably stands for 'G' as in drive letter, -psprovider filesystem, so it's a file system provider, and then -unidade_auxiliar. Hmm, that last part looks off because \"unidade_auxiliar\" isn't a recognized parameter in PowerShell. Maybe it's supposed to be something else, like a target path? It ends with \\\\Target\\\\C$, which suggests trying to access the C$ administrative share on a remote machine named Target. That's definitely a red flag because accessing such shares often indicates potential unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n\nThen, looking at the subsequent events, each has a \"winlog\" task of \"Execute a Remote Command\". This repeats 18 times after the first event. Repeated attempts to execute remote commands could be part of an attack vector, especially if they're failing or succeeding but showing unusual behavior.\n\nI'm thinking about what these events might mean together. The initial attempt with powershell.exe is trying to create a mapped drive to a remote C$ share, which is commonly used for privilege escalation or lateral movement in attacks. If that succeeds, it could allow an attacker to access the target system's files and directories. The following events of executing remote commands might be part of the same attack chain, perhaps attempting to run malicious scripts or execute other payloads on the remote machine.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple attempts suggests either a script is trying different methods or maybe credential stuffing. Also, the repetition could indicate that the attacker is trying multiple times, possibly in an attempt to bypass security measures like rate limiting or failed attempt locks.\n\nI should consider potential indicators of compromise here. Using powershell.exe for such commands is common in both legitimate and malicious activities, but combined with the remote command executions, it raises concern. Moreover, the incorrect parameter name \"unidade_auxiliar\" might be a typo that could indicate an attacker's script or tool was misconfigured, or perhaps it's a deliberate attempt to evade detection by using less common terms.\n\nAnother angle is whether these events are originating from different sources or the same one. If they're all from the same source IP or user account, that might suggest a prolonged attack session. Alternatively, if spread across multiple origins, it could be part of a larger campaign.\n\nI'm also thinking about how this aligns with known attack patterns. The initial command line looks similar to techniques used in ransomware or other malware for persistence and lateral movement. The repeated remote command executions could be trying to deploy additional tools or payloads on the compromised system.\n\nIn terms of confidence, while there's no direct evidence of malicious payload execution beyond these logs, the combination of attempting to access a sensitive share and repeatedly executing remote commands is concerning. It meets several criteria for potential malicious activity: use of PowerShell, repeated failed attempts (if they're failing), or perhaps successful ones if not logged as such.\n\nSo putting it all together, this batch shows potentially malicious activities that could indicate an attack in progress or preparation. The justification would be the suspicious command line and multiple remote command executions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes a suspicious PowerShell command attempting to access a remote C$ share, followed by multiple attempts to execute remote commands, indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
