{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's look at each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first six entries are all from chrome.exe with a task labeled as \"Registry value set.\" That sounds a bit suspicious because Chrome shouldn't be making changes to the registry too often, especially multiple times in a row without any other activity.\n\nThen there's an entry from powershell.exe with a process access event. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be something important. I should check if there are other instances of powershell.exe doing more than just accessing processes.\n\nNext, there's whoami.exe being run. That command-line tool is often used to get user information, which in some cases can be part of reconnaissance during an attack. However, on its own, it might not be malicious unless it's part of a larger sequence of actions.\n\nLooking at the last event again, another powershell.exe access. So we have two instances where PowerShell was accessed. This repetition raises my concern because attackers often use multiple calls to avoid detection or to execute different parts of a script.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple registry writes from Chrome could indicate persistence mechanisms or malicious activity trying to hide itself. The repeated use of PowerShell is a red flag, especially if these accesses are followed by other actions that aren't logged here. Also, the use of whoami.exe adds to the suspicion because it's often used in early stages of attacks to gather information.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple flags: unusual registry activity from a browser, repeated PowerShell accesses, and use of whoami.exe. The confidence is high, maybe around 0.85, but not a perfect 1.0 because some actions might be legitimate, though in this case it seems more likely to be malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and repeated powershell.exe process accesses along with whoami.exe execution suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system events. So, I'm seeing multiple entries where different processes like svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and others are setting registry values and creating files. Hmm, the first few lines show svchost.exe setting registry values repeatedly. That might be normal since svchost is a common Windows process, but too many such events could indicate something suspicious.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe creates a file called unidade_ativo.txt in the Downloads folder. Powershell is often used for scripting and can be a vector for attacks. Creating files, especially with names like 'ativo' which translates to 'active' in Portuguese, might suggest some kind of malicious activity or persistence mechanism.\n\nI also notice that ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe are setting registry values. While these are legitimate processes, unexpected registry modifications could be a red flag. For example, if an application like Calculator is modifying the registry excessively, it might indicate tampering.\n\nLooking at the file creation events, besides the one from powershell, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe which seems benign as it's part of their data collection process. But the unidade_ativo.txt stands out because it's in the Downloads folder and the naming suggests it might be related to some kind of malware activity.\n\nThe fact that multiple processes are involved and performing similar actions—setting registry values and creating files—could indicate a coordinated effort, possibly from malicious scripts or tools trying to maintain persistence or drop files. The combination of these activities across different legitimate processes might be an attempt to fly under the radar but collectively they raise concerns.\n\nI'm also noting that some events don't have associated files, which is normal for registry operations, but when combined with file creation events and considering the nature of the processes involved, it's worth investigating further. There's a potential pattern here that could be indicative of malware trying to establish persistence or create backdoors.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not seem alarming, the aggregate shows multiple processes making changes that don't align with typical user behavior, especially when involving powershell.exe and file creation in user directories. This combination makes me lean towards classifying this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes including svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe are showing registry value set events. Powershell created a file named 'unidade_ativo.txt' in the Downloads folder, which may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections and a DNS query. That's normal because Chrome is a browser that makes a lot of network requests and DNS lookups. So, these alone might not be suspicious.\n\nThen there are some events from RuntimeBroker.exe accessing the registry. Runtime Broker is part of Windows responsible for managing user runtime permissions, so it making registry changes seems legitimate. Not a red flag here.\n\nNotepad.exe also accesses the registry. Again, not unusual since many applications interact with the Windows registry for configuration settings.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell process accessed. Powershell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, but accessing it doesn't automatically mean something is wrong. It could just be a user running scripts or system admin tasks.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll seems a bit odd. I know that calc.exe is usually benign, but why would it load urlmon? Wait, urlmon is part of URLMON.DLL which handles URL processing for OLE. But sometimes malicious actors might inject code into legitimate processes. However, without more context, this could be normal or a sign of something else.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe with a command line that creates scheduled tasks using schtasks. The command lines show creating tasks on logon and startup that execute calc.exe as system. This is concerning because it's setting up persistence mechanisms. Scheduling tasks to run at logon or startup could be part of a persistence strategy used by malware.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple schtasks.exe processes creating similar scheduled tasks. Each task points to running cmd.exe which in turn runs calc.exe with admin privileges (system user). This repetition is suspicious because it's the same pattern repeated several times—multiple schtasks create commands for different task names but same payload. It suggests automation or a script being used to deploy these tasks, possibly as part of an attack.\n\nAlso, svchost.exe making registry changes and file creation in Task directory: Svchost.exe is legitimate but it's known to be often targeted by malware because it runs with system privileges. If it's creating files in the Windows Task folder, that could indicate malicious activity setting up services or tasks.\n\nPutting all together, there are several red flags:\n1. Multiple schtasks.exe creating scheduled tasks at logon\/startup pointing to calc.exe.\n2. cmd.exe being used to execute these tasks with system privileges.\n3. Repetitive registry modifications by svchost.exe and other processes.\n4. The combination of process creations, registry changes, and file writes suggests persistence mechanisms typical in malware.\n\nThe activities don't align with normal user behavior; instead, they mimic techniques used by attackers for lateral movement or establishing persistence on a compromised system. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including repeated registry modifications and scheduled task creations that could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
