{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from powershell.exe being executed. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. The command lines show Compress-Archive commands, which suggests someone is trying to create ZIP files in the TEMP directory. That could mean they're exfiltrating data or setting up something malicious.\n\nI notice several \"Process Create\" events for powershell.exe, which makes me think it's being used repeatedly, possibly as part of a script. Then there are \"Registry value set\" tasks, indicating that the process is modifying the registry. That's concerning because changes to the registry can be persistence mechanisms or signs of malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the file events, there's a pattern where files like __PSScriptPolicyTest_t13oq01p.uuw.ps1 are created and then deleted shortly after. This could be an attempt to bypass script execution policies by creating and deleting temporary scripts quickly. Such behavior is often seen in attacks to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, the events show multiple instances of powershell.exe loading various .NET framework DLLs and some Windows Defender components. While this isn't necessarily malicious on its own, combined with the other activities, it raises suspicion about potential code injection or process manipulation.\n\nThe repeated Compress-Archive commands suggest data compression might be happening, possibly to package files for exfiltration. The use of -Force in these commands could indicate that the script is overwriting existing files without prompting, which is another red flag.\n\nOverall, the combination of powershell.exe usage with registry modifications, temporary file creation\/deletion, and ZIP archive creation points towards potential malicious activity. The consistency in command patterns suggests it might be a coordinated attack or automated script execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing Compress-Archive commands with suspicious paths, combined with registry modifications and file creation\/deletion in the TEMP directory suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, most of the events involve PowerShell executing Compress-Archive commands. That seems a bit unusual because regular use of such commands could be part of normal operations, but multiple instances might raise flags. Each event shows different paths being compressed into ZIP files in the TEMP directory. The repeated use of Compress-Archive with similar naming conventions (like *_temporario.zip) makes me think this isn't just a one-off script.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and process names, I notice that each PowerShell command is creating a new zip file from different directories on the system. This could be an attempt to gather or compress sensitive data across multiple locations, possibly indicating data exfiltration. Also, some of these events are associated with tasks like 'Pipeline Execution Details' and 'Executing Pipeline', which suggests that these aren't just static commands but part of a more complex script execution.\n\nAnother point is the variety of file paths being accessed. For example, there's C:\\pacote_logico\\unidade_auxiliar\\modulo_principal\\bin\\tarefa_geral and others. The use of backslashes and Portuguese terms like \"pacote\" (package) and \"objeto\" (object) makes me think this might be a localized system, possibly in a Latin American country or Brazil. This localization could be relevant for understanding the context but doesn't directly indicate malicious activity on its own.\n\nI also see events where other processes are involved, like winlogbeat.exe and notepad.exe accessing registry values and files. However, the majority of concerning activities revolve around PowerShell's use, which is a common tool for attackers to execute commands and move laterally within a network.\n\nThe confidence here is high because multiple events show repetitive and potentially suspicious behavior with PowerShell, especially when combined with file compression and temporary storage. This pattern could be part of an attack chain, such as data gathering or lateral movement.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Powershell executing Compress-Archive commands across different directories, potentially indicating data exfiltration or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events and decide if they're interesting or not for investigation. The user has given me 20 JSONL entries, each representing an event.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **svchost.exe** is involved in multiple registry value sets. I know svchost is a legitimate Windows process, often used by services. But it's also commonly used by malware because many services run under it. So repeated registry changes could be suspicious.\n   \n2. Calculator.exe loads urlmon.dll. That seems normal since Calculator is a standard app and urlmon is part of Windows for handling URLs.\n\n3. winlogbeat.exe creates a file, which makes sense if it's an agent installed on the system for collecting logs. But I should check if this path looks legitimate or if it's placed somewhere unexpected.\n\n4. ApplicationFrameHost.exe also sets registry values. This process is related to Windows apps and desktops, so again, not inherently suspicious unless there's a pattern of many such events.\n\n5. Calculator.exe setting a registry value—this might be unusual since calculators typically don't modify the registry often. I'll note this but need more context.\n\n6. powershell.exe sets a registry value. PowerShell is a powerful tool and often used by attackers for command execution and persistence. Any script or command running under it could be malicious, so this stands out.\n\n7. Another event with powershell.exe accessing a process—this could indicate some form of process injection or lateral movement, which are red flags in security.\n\n8. chrome.exe creating pipes and modifying the registry. While Chrome is a common browser, frequent registry changes might suggest extensions or plugins acting maliciously, or potentially compromised processes.\n\n9. Multiple chrome.exe events involve image loads for system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate components, but if they're being loaded frequently, it could indicate tampering or exploitation attempts.\n\n10. More svchost.exe registry changes reinforce the idea that this might be part of malicious activity, especially if these events are happening outside of normal operations.\n\n11. winlogbeat.exe creating a file again—could this be a log injection attempt? Or maybe the agent is misconfigured and trying to write logs repeatedly?\n\n12. powershell.exe accessing another process—this could be an indicator of post-exploitation activity, like moving laterally within the network.\n\n13. whoami.exe being executed from the system32 directory with no command line arguments. While this is a standard tool for checking user info, its execution might be part of malicious activities to gather information about the system.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch has several red flags:\n- **svchost.exe** and **powershell.exe** showing multiple suspicious events.\n- Multiple registry modifications by different processes, which could indicate persistence mechanisms or configuration changes for malicious purposes.\n- Repeated file loads in Chrome that might not be standard behavior.\n- Use of whoami.exe without a command line argument could be part of an information-gathering phase.\n\nI need to assess the confidence level. The presence of powershell.exe and svchost.exe with these activities is concerning, especially since both are common tools for attackers. However, some events like Calculator loading system DLLs or Chrome's image loads might not necessarily be malicious but could still warrant closer inspection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe and powershell.exe, which are commonly used in malware. There's also an unusual use of whoami.exe without arguments, indicating potential system probing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
