{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several events from chrome.exe showing network connections and a DNS query. That seems normal because Chrome is known to make many network requests as part of its operation, especially when browsing the web. So nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, I notice multiple entries for powershell.exe with various tasks like ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, ImageLoad, FileCreate, and FileDeleteDetected. PowerShell can be a red flag because it's often used by attackers to execute malicious scripts or access system resources. The command line in some events shows commands like 'ls -recurse' which is just listing directories, but the way it's executed could indicate scripting.\n\nLooking deeper, there are entries where powershell.exe creates temporary files and then deletes them. This behavior can be concerning because deleting logs after creation might be an attempt to cover tracks. Also, the repeated use of PowerShell with similar commands might suggest automated or script-based activity, which could be malicious.\n\nAnother point is that some events show image loading from various .NET frameworks, which is normal for PowerShell scripts but could also be part of a larger payload being executed.\n\nConsidering all these together, while individual actions by Chrome and PowerShell can be benign, the combination—especially the file creation and deletion in Temp directory and repeated registry accesses—raises flags. These activities don't align with typical user behavior and might indicate potential malicious scripting or lateral movement within a network.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch of events does show some concerning patterns that merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit potentially malicious activity including file creation\/deletion in the Temp directory and repeated registry access. These actions may indicate scripting or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where the process is powershell.exe with specific command lines that involve listing files recursively using 'ls', 'get-childitem', and 'gci'. This repetition stands out because it's unusual to see the same PowerShell command repeated so many times. Typically, legitimate use of PowerShell for system administration or scripting might vary commands more. So this could be a sign of something malicious, like a script trying to gather information across multiple directories.\n\nNext, I notice that several events show tasks related to file creation and registry value setting by powershell.exe. Creating files or modifying the registry is common in attacks to leave backdoors or alter system configurations. Additionally, there are entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files, which might be normal if it's part of data collection, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it raises flags.\n\nLooking further down, there are events where svchost.exe is involved in registry modifications. Svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, often used by services, but it's also commonly exploited by malware to hide malicious activity. Multiple instances of Registry value sets from the same or different processes could indicate tampering with system settings for persistence or other malicious purposes.\n\nThere are several events where the task is 'RegistryEvent' from various executables like powershell.exe and svchost.exe. Frequent registry changes, especially by non-standard processes, can be a red flag because attackers often need to modify the registry for persistence mechanisms or to alter system behavior.\n\nI also see some events related to user account management and special logon tasks without corresponding process information. This could indicate attempts to create new accounts, modify existing ones, or escalate privileges, which are key indicators of potential compromise.\n\nConsidering all these points together: repeated use of PowerShell commands for directory traversal, file creation by multiple processes, registry modifications from unusual sources, and user account-related events without clear justification make the entire batch suspicious. These activities don't align with typical user behavior and could be signs of a security incident such as malware infection or unauthorized access.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it exhibits several red flags that suggest malicious activity when viewed collectively.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious events including repeated PowerShell command executions, file creations by non-standard processes, and registry modifications which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. There are 17 events in total, each represented as a JSON object on separate lines. My task is to analyze the entire batch together and determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first eight events:\n- They all have \"process\": None\n- The winlog field shows {'task': 'User Account Management'}\n- File is also None\n\nThese seem to be related to user account activity. User account management events are pretty common, especially in environments where users log in and out frequently or there's group policy enforcement. Without additional context like the frequency of these events or any anomalies, they might not raise red flags on their own.\n\nNext, looking at event 9:\n- Process is 'winlogbeat.exe'\n- Winlog task is 'File created' with a specific path\n- File points to a .yml.new file in the winlogbeat directory\n\nWinlogbeat is an agent used for collecting Windows logs. It's normal for it to create files during operation, so this event seems benign.\n\nEvent 10:\n- Process: 'RuntimeBroker.exe'\n- Winlog task: Registry value set\n- File: None\n\nRuntime Broker is a legitimate Windows process that handles user runtime events and interacts with the registry. A registry value being set isn't unusual unless it's part of malicious activity, but there's no indication here.\n\nEvent 11:\n- Process: 'notepad.exe'\n- Winlog task: Registry value set\n- File: None\n\nNotepad is a common application. It accessing or modifying registry values could be normal depending on what it's doing, but again, without context, it doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nEvent 12:\n- Process: 'powershell.exe'\n- Winlog task: Process accessed\n- File: None\n\nPowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities. A process access event could mean many things—script execution, debugging, etc. Without knowing the exact command or activity, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nEvent 13:\n- Process: 'calc.exe'\n- Winlog task: Image loaded\n- File points to urlmon.dll\n\nCalc is a simple calculator, and loading urlmon.dll is part of its normal operation. URLMON.DLL handles URL parsing and is standard for many Windows applications. This event doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nEvent 14:\n- Process: 'svchost.exe'\n- Winlog task: Registry value set\n- File: None\n\nSvchost.exe is a common process that hosts various system services. It frequently interacts with the registry, so this activity is expected and not concerning on its own.\n\nEvent 15:\n- Another instance of svchost.exe setting a registry value—again, normal behavior.\n\nEvent 16:\n- Process: 'Calculator.exe'\n- Winlog task: Image loaded\n- File points to urlmon.dll\n\nSimilar to event 13. Calculator is another standard application, and loading URLMON.DLL is part of its typical operations.\n\nNow, stepping back, the batch contains a mix of user account management events, legitimate processes like winlogbeat, notepad, powershell, calc, RuntimeBroker, and Svchost. Most of these are normal and expected system activities. The only potentially concerning event is the PowerShell process access, but even that could be benign without more context.\n\nConsidering all together, there's no clear pattern of malicious behavior. While some processes like powershell.exe can be used for attacks, this single event doesn't provide enough evidence on its own. There are no signs of unusual file accesses, multiple failed attempts, or other red flags typically seen in an attack.\n\nTherefore, the batch as a whole doesn't seem to warrant further investigation. It's more about routine system operations and normal application behaviors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are a mix of normal system activities including user account management, legitimate process executions, and standard file\/registry interactions without any signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
