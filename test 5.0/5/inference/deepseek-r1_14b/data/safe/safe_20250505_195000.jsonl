{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, several events show \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading different DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll multiple times. That seems repetitive but not necessarily suspicious unless it's an uncommon process on the system.\n\nNext, there are logs from \"taskhostw.exe\" loading taskschd.dll. TaskHostW.exe is a legitimate Windows process related to task scheduling, so this isn't concerning.\n\nThe \"services.exe\" log with a \"Logon\" event is normal as services often interact with user logons during system operations.\n\nA null process with a \"Special Logon\" could be something like a service or system account logging on, which is standard and not malicious.\n\nMultiple DNS query events from \"SDXHelper.exe\" might raise an eyebrow if it's querying unusual domains, but the data doesn't specify the actual queries, so I can't assess that here.\n\nA file creation event by \"winlogbeat.exe\" seems related to log management software, which is expected and benign.\n\nThen there's a \"powershell.exe\" process starting and loading several DLLs. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command line doesn't show any suspicious arguments, just the standard execution path.\n\nAnother file creation by powershell.exe in a temporary directory could be normal script execution, but without knowing the content of __PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1, it's hard to say. However, since there are multiple events related to PowerShell loading legitimate DLLs and creating files, it might just be regular usage.\n\nPutting it all together: There's repetition in process activity but nothing overtly malicious. The use of legitimate tools like PowerShell isn't unusual, and the events don't indicate any clear signs of compromise or exploit.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are mostly repetitive and normal system activities with no clear indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved. The first event shows that a file was deleted using PowerShell. Specifically, the file path is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1. That's a bit concerning because deleting files with scripts can sometimes be part of malicious activities.\n\nThen there are several entries where powershell.exe logs tasks like \"Pipe Created,\" \"Provider Lifecycle,\" and \"Image loaded.\" These seem normal for PowerShell since it's a common tool, but I should keep an eye out if they're happening too frequently or in combination with other events. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of the same command line being executed for powershell.exe under different tasks like \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"Process Create.\" This repetition might indicate that PowerShell is being used for some automated process, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nI also see events involving py.exe and python.exe. These are related to Python executions. The user has a Python installation in their AppData folder, which is typical for a standard setup. However, I notice that both py.exe and python.exe are involved in process creation and image loading. This could be normal if they're running scripts or applications, but again, without additional context, it's not clear.\n\nOne point of interest is the file deletion event. Malicious actors often use PowerShell to delete files as part of data exfiltration or destruction. The fact that a script (mdx.ps1) was deleted might suggest an attempt to remove evidence or disrupt normal operations. But I need to consider if this is part of legitimate system administration or if it's truly malicious.\n\nAnother consideration is the frequency of events related to PowerShell and Python. There are multiple entries for each, which could indicate a script running in a loop or as part of a scheduled task. However, without knowing the normal baseline for this system, it's hard to say definitively whether this activity is unusual.\n\nThe process access event on powershell.exe might be indicative of some form of inter-process communication, which could be legitimate but also potentially malicious if used by another process to gain unauthorized access.\n\nIn summary, while there are no outright red flags that scream \"attack,\" the combination of multiple PowerShell executions and a file deletion event does raise an eyebrow. It's possible that this is part of a script or tool running in the background, but given the variety of tasks logged, it might warrant closer investigation to ensure none of these activities are part of a larger malicious campaign.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe execution and file deletion detected, potentially indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is from \"python.exe\" where an image was loaded. That seems normal since Python runs scripts and might load DLLs for functionality. The path looks legitimate, pointing to a standard Python installation location with \"_ctypes.pyd\" which I know is part of the Python distribution.\n\nNext, another event again from \"python.exe\", but this time loading \"libffi-8.dll\". That's also expected because libffi is used by Python for certain extensions. So nothing unusual there either.\n\nMoving on to the third event, it's about \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the data directory with \".winlogbeat.yml.new\". Winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool related to log management, so this file creation seems part of its normal setup process. The naming suggests it's updating configuration files, which is typical during installations or updates.\n\nThe fourth event involves \"SDXHelper.exe\" making a DNS query. I'm not too familiar with SDXHelper, but the name sounds like it could be a system or diagnostic tool. DNS queries are common for software to check for updates or validate configurations, so this doesn't raise any red flags immediately.\n\nThe fifth and sixth events again involve \"SDXHelper.exe\" making DNS queries without file interactions. Repeating DNS lookups might be part of a legitimate process, especially if the tool is checking multiple times or trying different servers. Still, it's worth keeping an eye on if these queries are to unusual domains later on.\n\nThe seventh event is another DNS query from SDXHelper. So we've seen this three times now. It could be normal for initializing connections or fetching data, but if all the queries go to similar or unexpected domains, that might warrant further investigation.\n\nLastly, \"RuntimeBroker.exe\" setting a registry value. Runtime Broker is part of Windows' User Account Control and manages app permissions. Seeing it modify registry entries isn't unusual as it handles runtime permissions for apps. This seems routine unless there's an irregular access pattern or writing to unexpected areas.\n\nPutting all these together: Python scripts loading necessary DLLs, winlogbeat setting up files, SDXHelper making several DNS queries which could be normal, and RuntimeBroker doing its thing. None of the events individually seem malicious, but I should consider their combination. The repetition of \"SDXHelper.exe\" DNS queries might indicate something like periodic checks or updates, which is okay unless they point to known bad domains.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as NOT INTERESTING because each event appears legitimate on its own and in combination. However, if the DNS queries are to malicious domains or there's unusual file creation elsewhere, that would change things. But based on the given data, everything seems within normal operational parameters.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activities such as Python loading DLLs, winlogbeat creating configuration files, and SDXHelper making DNS queries. There is no indication of malicious behavior in the provided log entries.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
