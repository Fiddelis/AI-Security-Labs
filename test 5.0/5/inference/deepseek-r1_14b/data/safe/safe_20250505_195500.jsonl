The file paths are similar but with different filenames. It seems like multiple files are being created in a specific directory under Microsoft Office's Solution Packages. This could be part of normal software operations, especially if it's related to updates or cache files.\n\nThen there are events from chrome.exe where the task is \"Registry value set\". These don't have file paths but involve registry changes. While this might seem suspicious, Chrome often modifies the registry for settings and extensions, so unless these values are unusual, it might not be concerning.\n\nI notice that SDXHelper.exe is creating several JavaScript files with varying hashes in their filenames. The repeated creation of multiple files could indicate some form of activity, maybe related to updates or perhaps more nefarious purposes like file injection. However, the fact that all these files are under a known Microsoft Office directory suggests it's part of legitimate operations.\n\nThe confidence here is low because while the repeated file creation might raise an eyebrow, the location and source (Microsoft-related) make it less likely to be malicious.

Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that most of them are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files. The paths all point to a specific folder within the user's Office SolutionPackages. Each event has a different file name with varying hashes, like \"01b1c4d03464acf87b14647f4dc2c34f.js\" and others. These seem to be JavaScript files being created.\n\nThen there are a couple of other events: one from \"svchost.exe\" loading BitsProxy.dll and another from \"chrome.exe\" doing the same. I know that svchost is a common system process, often used by services, so it's normal for it to load DLLs. Chrome also frequently interacts with system files, especially if it's handling background processes or extensions.\n\nThe main thing here is the repeated file creation events from SDXHelper.exe. This could be legitimate activity, like an Office add-in downloading resources. However, the number of files being created and their specific paths make me a bit cautious. Malware often creates multiple files in quick succession to avoid detection or to establish persistence.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether these file creations are part of a known Office update or if they're unusual for this user's environment. If this is a first-time occurrence, it might be worth investigating further. The repeated pattern suggests some automated process, which could be either legitimate or malicious.\n\nThe BitsProxy.dll being loaded by both svchost and chrome makes me think about Windows Update components. But since both processes are doing it, maybe there's an issue with how updates are being handled. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nOverall, while some of these events look normal, the volume and specific nature of the file creations from SDXHelper.exe raise a red flag.

Let me go through each one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: Process is SDXHelper.exe creating a file in the Office Solution Packages directory. The path looks long but seems legitimate, maybe part of an Office add-in or something similar. Not too concerning yet.\n\nLooking at the next few events, they're all from the same process, SDXHelper.exe, and they're creating multiple files with similar names but different hashes. It seems like this is a repeated action—maybe during an update or installation of some package. The file paths are consistent, so nothing unusual here.\n\nThen there's an event where Process is null, task is \"Security Group Management\". Not sure what that means exactly, but maybe it's just system-level activity. I'll keep that in mind but not flag it yet.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its data directory. That makes sense if it's a log management tool like the Elastic WinlogBeat agent. It's probably setting up or updating its configuration file. Not suspicious.\n\nBack to SDXHelper.exe again, creating more files with similar names but different hashes each time. I notice that some file paths are duplicated, which might indicate multiple writes to the same location. But since all events come from the same process and the same directory, it's likely normal behavior for that application.\n\nThe last few events continue this pattern—SDXHelper.exe creating several files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. The naming convention suggests they're JavaScript files, possibly related to Office AI Copilot or some feature package. It seems like a lot of small JS files are being written, but without context on what SDXHelper.exe does normally, it's hard to say if this is unusual.\n\nI should consider the confidence level. If SDXHelper.exe is known for creating many files during operation, then this batch is normal. However, if this behavior is out of the ordinary, it could be a sign of something malicious, like file injection or persistence mechanisms. But since all events are consistent and within the same process, I'm leaning towards not being concerning.\n\nThere's also that one event with Process null and Security Group Management. Not enough info to classify as interesting on its own, especially if it's part of standard system operations.\n\nOverall, while multiple file creation events can be red flags for malicious activity, in this case, they seem to be legitimate actions by a known process related to Office packages. The only thing that raises a tiny flag is the sheer number of files being created, but without further context, I don't have enough evidence to classify this as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events from the same process (SDXHelper.exe) in a known directory structure, likely related to Office package updates.

All of them are from the same process, SDXHelper.exe, which is creating files in a specific path under the user's AppData directory.

This repetition makes me think it's part of a normal process, perhaps during an Office update or when loading certain resources. These files are likely JavaScript strings used by Microsoft Office features, possibly related to AI Copilot as indicated in the filenames.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. The same file creation events without variations in process names or unusual paths make it seem routine. No anomalies like unexpected locations, multiple failed attempts, or deviations from standard user activity are present.\n\nSo, considering all these points, this batch doesn't raise any red flags.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. I'm given a batch of 14 JSON events, each representing a file creation event by the process SDXHelper.exe in Windows. The same pattern repeats across all entries: the process is always SDXHelper.exe, the task is a FileCreate event, and the file paths vary but follow a similar structure.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the files being created, they all have names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_[random characters].js\". The path leads into the SolutionPackages folder under Microsoft Office in the user's AppData directory. This seems legitimate because Microsoft Office often stores solution packages and resources there, especially for features like AI Copilot which would require such string files for functionality.\n\nSDXHelper.exe is a known component used by Microsoft to deploy and manage software updates and patches. It's part of the Windows Update or related mechanisms. So it makes sense that this process is creating these files as part of its normal operation, perhaps during an update or configuration change.\n\nEach event is consistent in structure and origin. There are multiple entries with slightly different filenames but following a predictable naming convention. The repetition might indicate a bulk file creation process, which could be normal if the system is updating multiple components at once.\n\nI should check if these types of events are typical for SDXHelper.exe. From what I recall, it's common for such processes to create or update files when deploying patches or new features. The fact that all these events come from the same process and target a known Microsoft directory suggests they're part of standard operations rather than malicious activity.\n\nAnother angle is whether multiple identical file creation events are normal. In some cases, redundant writes might occur, especially if there's a retry mechanism in place after an initial failure. However, here each event has a unique filename, so it's not the same file being created multiple times but different ones, which aligns with a legitimate update process.\n\nI also consider the possibility of this being part of a larger attack vector, like file injection or malicious script execution. But given the path structure and the naming pattern related to Office AI components, it doesn't raise red flags. Malware would typically target more sensitive areas or use different naming conventions that don't align with standard software practices.\n\nAdditionally, there's no indication of any other events in the batch that might be suspicious alongside these file creations, like access to restricted directories, attempts to execute files, or network communication anomalies. All events are isolated to file creation tasks within an expected area for Microsoft Office-related processes.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to monitor such activities, there doesn't seem to be any malicious intent here. These events fit the profile of legitimate operations performed by a known system process related to software updates and management.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate Microsoft process.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The same process name appears in all: \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the file path points to various .js files under the Microsoft Office OfflineFiles directory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if these activities are normal or not. SDXHelper.exe sounds like it's part of Microsoft Office; maybe it's a legitimate process for handling offline files. The file paths lead to specific JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages folder, which is typical for Office add-ins or resources used when the user is offline.\n\nI should check if multiple writes to these files are expected behavior. It could be that the system is downloading or updating these files during an Office session, especially if the user has certain add-ins installed. Since each event is a file creation, and they're all under the same directory with different filenames, it's possible that this is part of normal operation—like caching or updating resources.\n\nI should also think about whether repeated file creations in this location could indicate something malicious. Malware often creates files in unexpected places, but here everything seems to be within an expected Office-related folder. The naming convention of the files (like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\") suggests they're related to AI features or language resources in Office.\n\nLooking for any anomalies: all events have the same process and task type, which is consistent with a legitimate background operation. No signs of unusual file names or paths that are commonly associated with malicious activities, like temporary files, executables in user directories, etc.\n\nSo, after considering, I don't see anything out of the ordinary here. These events seem to be part of normal Office operations, possibly during an update or cache refresh. Therefore, this batch likely isn't interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions by the SDXHelper.exe process within a legitimate Microsoft Office directory.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if the entire set is interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event.\n\nAll the events have the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's a red flag because I'm not familiar with that executable off the top of my head. Usually, standard system processes have names like \"svchost.exe\" or \"services.exe\", so an unfamiliar exe might indicate something suspicious.\n\nNext, each event is a file creation event from Windows logs. The task field says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means this is tracking the creation of new files. So SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple files in a specific directory under the user's AppData folder. That path looks like it's within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages, specifically in the OfflineFiles subdirectory.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\[some GUID]\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\" followed by a filename that has a .js extension. The filenames vary but follow a pattern like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_[hash].js\".\n\nI'm wondering why SDXHelper.exe is creating so many JavaScript files in this location. Microsoft Office uses scripts and resources, especially for features like AI Copilot, which might require some client-side scripting. But the fact that multiple identical files are being created (as seen by duplicate hashes in filenames) suggests something repetitive or automated.\n\nOne possibility is that this is part of a legitimate update process where new JavaScript files are being downloaded or extracted. However, another concern is that SDXHelper.exe could be malicious, perhaps dropping multiple script files as part of an attack. The high frequency and repetition might indicate an attempt to write numerous files quickly, which can sometimes be a sign of a potential exploit.\n\nI should also consider the number of events—there are 14 entries, each creating a different JavaScript file. That seems excessive unless it's related to a legitimate process requiring many resources. But again, I'm not certain if this is normal behavior for SDXHelper.exe.\n\nLooking at the structure of the file paths, they're nested deep within user-specific directories, which makes me think that these files are per-user and might contain some configuration or data specific to each user's Office setup. If these files were malicious, targeting individual users could be a vector for attacks.\n\nI also notice that all events are from the same process and involve creating multiple JavaScript files in a short time frame. This could be part of an installation routine or a background update, but without knowing more about what SDXHelper.exe is supposed to do, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nTo assess confidence, I'd give it a moderate score because while there are red flags like unfamiliar process names and repetitive file creation, it's possible that this activity is legitimate. However, the combination of multiple identical files being created by an unknown exe increases the suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical JavaScript files are being created by an unfamiliar process (SDXHelper.exe) in a user-specific directory, suggesting potential malicious activity or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at each event, they all seem similar but let me go through them one by one. The first few entries are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in a specific path under \"AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\". Each file has a long name with hashes and ends with .js. This pattern repeats multiple times, about 12 events where the same process is creating these JavaScript files.\n\nThen there's an event from \"chrome.exe\" creating a temporary file in the Downloads folder. That seems normal because Chrome often creates temp files when downloading stuff. But then again, it's only one such event, so that might not be as significant.\n\nNow, thinking about what could be concerning here. \"SDXHelper.exe\" sounds like it's part of Microsoft Office, maybe some add-in or helper tool. The fact that it's creating multiple JavaScript files in an OfflineFiles directory suggests it's related to the Office Add-ins or perhaps some client-side features. These files are likely static resources needed for functionality.\n\nThe repeated file creation events could indicate a legitimate process, like installing or updating these resources. However, sometimes attackers use similar patterns to drop malicious scripts. But in this case, all the paths are under standard Microsoft Office directories, which reduces the chance of it being malicious.\n\nAnother angle: could these files be part of some known vulnerability? I don't recall any specific ones related to these filenames or paths. Also, since they're all .js files and created by a legitimate process, unless there's an unusual number of them or unexpected access times, this might not raise red flags.\n\nThe single event from Chrome creating a temp file doesn't seem out of the ordinary either. It's common for browsers to create such files during operations.\n\nOn the other hand, seeing multiple identical file creation events by the same process could be suspicious if they're writing to unusual locations or if there's an attempt to write to the same file multiple times, which might indicate a failure or malicious behavior. But in this case, each file path is unique, so it looks like legitimate resource creation.\n\nI also don't see any signs of permissions issues or access denied errors, which would make me more cautious. All events seem to complete successfully without such anomalies.\n\nSo considering all these points, while the volume of file creations is high, they appear to be part of normal Office operations. There's no evidence in the logs provided that suggests malicious activity or indicators of compromise.

Looking at the first few lines, they all seem similar: the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\", the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the file path points to different JavaScript files under a specific directory.\n\nI notice that these events are creating files in the same parent directory but with different filenames. The paths look like they're part of an Office package, specifically under \"Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\". This makes me think it's related to Office add-ins or extensions. The naming pattern in the filenames suggests they might be versions or components of a particular feature, possibly related to AI Copilot given the mention of \"officeaicopilot\" in the path.\n\nThen, I see that some events are from \"chrome.exe\", with tasks like setting registry values and loading images. These seem normal for Chrome's operation, especially when it interacts with system files or registry entries. The file paths mentioned, like urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll, are standard system files, so no red flags there.\n\nLooking at the repetition: There are multiple identical events creating these JavaScript files. This could be part of a legitimate process where the application is downloading or updating resources. Since all the events are from the same process name and similar file operations, it doesn't seem suspicious at first glance.\n\nI also consider the possibility of these being part of an update or cache mechanism for Office add-ins. The fact that each file has a unique hash in its filename suggests they might be different versions or parts of a larger resource, which is typical during updates or initial installations.\n\nAnother point is the lack of any unusual processes or tasks outside the norm. All activities are within expected boundaries for these applications. No signs of privilege escalation, unauthorized access attempts, or known malicious behavior patterns are present in the logs.\n\nGiven all this, I don't see any indicators of compromise (IoCs) like process injection, unexpected file creation locations, or communication with external domains.

I'm noticing that these are being created multiple times—some paths repeat twice. That could be normal if the application is caching or updating resources periodically.\n\nThen there's an event from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a new config file, which makes sense since it's likely the log collection tool writing its configuration.\n\nNext up is \"chrome.exe\" loading some system DLLs and making a registry change. That seems standard for a browser process interacting with system components.\n\nAfter that, there are entries from Excel starting up and opening a specific .xlsx file. It also loads a system DLL like combase.dll, which is typical for Office apps.\n\nThe last event again involves \"SDXHelper.exe\" but points to a different package ID. This suggests it's part of the same process or another update step.\n\nPutting this together, most of these events are related to normal application activities—Office apps creating files, Chrome loading resources, and system processes interacting as expected. There's nothing unusual like unexpected file accesses, failed logins, or signs of malicious activity.

Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nNext, multiple events show Excel.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. These are standard .NET framework components, so they're expected when running applications in Windows. Nothing malicious here on the surface.\n\nThen there are several instances of svchost.exe modifying registry values. SvcHost is a common system process that hosts services, and it's normal for it to interact with the registry. Without seeing unusual registry keys or repeated attempts, this doesn't raise red flags.\n\nLooking further down, I notice Excel creating and then deleting a file in the Downloads folder.

That seems normal because Chrome often loads various DLLs, especially those related to security features or plugins. Windows Defender's MpClient.dll sounds legitimate.\n\n2. **Events 2 and 3**: SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The file paths look like they're part of Microsoft Office packages, specifically under \"OfflineFiles.\" These seem routine as part of how Office handles resources, especially for features like AI Copilot which I know uses such structures.\n\n3. **Events 4-6**: chrome.exe setting registry values multiple times. Registry modifications aren't inherently bad, but repeated writes can sometimes indicate malicious activity. However, in this case, since it's Chrome, which does modify the registry for settings or extensions, these might be normal unless there are unusual values involved.\n\n4. **Events 7 and 8**: More file creations by SDXHelper.exe, again pointing to Office-related resources. The paths seem consistent with legitimate package updates or installations.\n\n5. **Events 9-14**: These involve chrome.exe creating files and streams related to a downloaded Excel file (\"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\"). The actions like creating streams and handling Zone.Identifier are typical when downloading files, especially from the internet, as part of tracking their origin or security markers. Chrome often does this for downloads.\n\n6. **Event 15**: Another registry write by chrome.exe. Again, unless it's modifying a suspicious key, this might not be concerning.\n\nLooking at all events together, I notice that both chrome.exe and SDXHelper.exe are performing actions within their expected behaviors. The file paths point to legitimate locations (e.g., Windows Defender, Microsoft Office packages). There are multiple identical events from the same processes, which could indicate repetitive tasks but nothing unusual in nature.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unexpected file creations in system directories, no writes to sensitive registry keys, and all activities align with standard operations for these processes.

SDXHelper is associated with Office, but repeated file creation in specific paths might indicate malicious activity or potential tampering.\n\nConsidering all events together, the Excel activities could be benign, but the SDXHelper actions are more notable. Since some elements stand out as potentially malicious and others don't, I'd classify this batch as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events from Excel.exe and file creation by SDXHelper.exe may indicate potential malicious activity or unusual behavior that warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by going through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the data directory. That makes sense because winlogbeat is an agent that collects logs, so it's normal for it to write configuration files like .winlogbeat.yml.new. Not suspicious here.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from \"SDXHelper.exe\". Each event shows that this process is creating files in specific paths under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The file paths look like they're part of Office's package resources and offline files. These seem legitimate since Microsoft Office uses such mechanisms for updating or managing its components.\n\nLooking further, there are two events where \"Explorer.EXE\" sets registry values. Windows Explorer interacting with the registry is standard for various operations, so these aren't unusual either.\n\nThen, several events from \"EXCEL.EXE\" also setting registry values and creating a file in the Recent directory pointing to a .xlsx file. It's typical for Excel to update recent files lists and interact with the registry when opening or saving documents.\n\nI notice that many of these events are repetitive—for example, multiple FileCreate tasks by SDXHelper.exe and Registry value sets by both Explorer.EXE and EXCEL.EXE. Repetition can be a sign of normal behavior rather than malicious activity, unless it's an unusually high volume beyond what's expected.\n\nConsidering all the events together, they don't show any signs of anomalies or deviations from standard user activities. There are no failed login attempts, access to unexpected files, or execution of unusual processes. All actions align with typical operations performed by system tools and common software like Office applications.\n\nTherefore, while each individual event might seem notable on its own, when analyzed as a whole batch, there's no indication of malicious behavior or anything that stands out as suspicious. The events are all within the realm of normal user activity and system processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal file creation and registry activities from legitimate processes such as winlogbeat.exe, SDXHelper.exe, Explorer.EXE, and EXCEL.EXE.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs. The first thing that stands out is the repeated occurrence of \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files and \"EXCEL.EXE\" making DNS queries. Let me break it down.\n\nThere are multiple events where SDXHelper.exe creates files in various paths under the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory. Each file path seems unique but follows a similar structure, like \"...\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\...\". These look like they're part of normal operations for Office add-ins or language packages because each has a locale code (e.g., ca-es, cs-cz) in their filenames.\n\nThen there are events from EXCEL.EXE performing DNS queries. Since Excel is an application that might need to check updates or access online resources, these could be legitimate as well.\n\nI should consider the context of these actions. If this user is working with Office applications and has multiple language packs installed, it's normal for these files to be created during setup or updates. The DNS queries by EXCEL.EXE could be related to checking for available updates, reaching online services, or other standard operations.\n\nThere’s no indication of unusual behavior here. No signs of failed logins, access to restricted areas, or attempts to execute code outside the expected process flow. All activities seem contained within known Microsoft Office structures and processes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these logs don't show any red flags.

Let me start by looking through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is an executable called HxTsr.exe setting a registry value. That's something that can be legitimate or malicious, but without more context, it's hard to say. I know some system processes do modify the registry regularly, so maybe this is normal.\n\nThen there are several events from SDXHelper.exe creating files in different locations. The paths look like they're within the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. Each file created seems to have a unique name with long GUID-like strings and various language codes (like en-us, ar-sa). This pattern makes me think these might be legitimate files being downloaded or cached by an application, possibly during an update or installation.\n\nI notice that each of these SDXHelper events creates the same file twice. For example, the am-et-ui-strings-json file is created twice in a row. Maybe it's a retry mechanism or just redundant logging. Not sure if that's significant yet.\n\nNext are some events from EXCEL.EXE creating files and loading images. The file paths look like temporary locations within AppData and Office packages. This seems normal for Excel when handling files, especially when dealing with streams or temporary storage during operations like opening a spreadsheet.\n\nLooking at the process names: HxTsr.exe and SDXHelper.exe are not immediately ringing any bells as common malware names. EXCEL.EXE is obviously legitimate. The file paths don't seem to be in system directories but rather user-specific app data, which is typical for application behavior.\n\nI also check if there's any indication of unusual access times or multiple failed attempts, but the logs just show creation and loading events without errors. No signs of repeated failures that might indicate a brute force attack or something similar.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the activities here seem to be part of normal operations for Microsoft Office applications, possibly during updates or file processing. There's no clear indication of malicious activity like registry modifications without reason, multiple failed attempts, or strange file accesses outside expected locations.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch consists of legitimate system processes related to Microsoft Office and Excel, with SDXHelper.exe creating files as part of normal operations and EXCEL.EXE handling files and loading libraries.

The main fields are 'process', 'winlog', and 'file'. \n\nLooking at the process field, all events have \"SDXHelper.exe\" as the name. I know that SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office, specifically handling Solution Packages, which are used for add-ins or language packs.\n\nThe winlog task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", meaning each event indicates a file was created. The file paths all point to locations under C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. Specifically, they're in the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles directory. Each path ends with a .js file, which is JavaScript, often used for UI strings or localization files.\n\nI notice that there are multiple entries for the same file paths, appearing twice each. This duplication might be normal if the application is initializing or updating these resources.

The file paths all point to various language-specific resources in different languages: es-mx, et-ee, eu-es, fa-ir, fi-fi, fil-ph, and fr-ca. These seem like standard localization strings for software applications.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're stored under \"OfflineFiles\" within the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory. This indicates that these files are part of some office software package, possibly updates or language packs. The repetition of creating the same file twice (like two entries for es-mx and others) might just be a normal process during an update or installation.\n\nI don't see any signs of suspicious behavior here.

That seems normal because Office often deals with package resources and language files. No red flags here.\n\nThen, there are a lot of events (24 to be exact) from \"EXCEL.EXE\" setting registry values. While Excel is legitimate software, excessive registry writes could be suspicious. Malware might modify the registry for persistence or other malicious activities. However, sometimes legitimate applications do write频繁to the registry during setup or updates.\n\nI should consider the context. If this happened in a controlled environment where Office is being used normally, these events might not be unusual. But without more context, the volume of identical events from Excel stands out. It's possible that an attacker is using Excel as part of a payload or exploiting it to make changes across many instances.\n\nOn balance, the repeated registry writes by Excel are concerning and merit further investigation.

So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL logs, each line being a separate event. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\" every time. The task in winlog is always \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the file paths are all under different language strings like it-it, ja-jp, etc. This pattern repeats multiple times with similar entries. So, these seem to be standard file creation events from a legitimate Office process.\n\nThen there's an event from \"EXCEL.EXE\" querying DNS. That makes sense because Excel might need to resolve some domain names for online content or services. It also has a registry value set event, which is normal for applications accessing configuration data.\n\nNext, multiple entries come from \"svchost.exe\", which is a common system process that hosts other services. The tasks are registry-related—object added\/deleted and value set. These activities could be part of normal Windows operations or updates to system configurations.\n\nLooking further down, there's another file creation event by SDXHelper.exe for the kn-in language strings. So, it's consistent with what I saw earlier. There's also an event where both process and winlog are null, which might just be a placeholder or an error in logging but doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting this all together, most of these events look like normal operations from legitimate processes—Office applications handling language resources, Excel doing DNS queries, system services updating registry settings. I don't see any signs of unusual behavior, like repeated failed logins, unknown processes, or access to restricted files. The duplication in file creation events might be due to multiple language packs being loaded or updated.\n\nTherefore, while the batch is thorough in logging, it doesn't indicate any malicious activity that would warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal file creation and registry operations by legitimate processes such as Office applications and system services.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that the logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. Looking at each event:\n\n1. The first few events all have \"process\" named \"SDXHelper.exe\". Each one reports a file creation under different paths, but they're all within the same directory structure: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\[some GUID]\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\*.js\n\n2. I notice that for each language variant (like fr-fr, ga-ie, etc.), there are two entries creating files with similar names but slightly different hashes at the end of their file paths. For example, \"fr-fr-ui-strings-json_9f4569f3d8b026ad194f0f4ff64d109c.js\" appears twice.\n\n3. The last event is different: it's from \"winlogbeat.exe\", creating a file named \".winlogbeat.yml.new\" in the Downloads directory.\n\nNow, thinking about what each process does:\n\n- SDXHelper.exe is likely related to Microsoft Office, possibly part of its update or language package management. These files being created are probably localization strings for the UI, which would be expected during an installation or update process. The fact that multiple language files are being created makes sense if a multi-language office suite is being installed.\n\n- winlogbeat.exe is likely part of the ELK stack (Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana) used for log management. Its creation of a .yml file in its data directory seems routine, probably during setup or configuration.\n\nLooking for signs of malicious activity:\n\n- The repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe don't seem suspicious on their own. They look like standard file operations that would occur during the installation or update process of Microsoft Office components, especially when dealing with multiple language packs.\n\n- The presence of .js files in the OfflineFiles directory doesn't raise red flags unless these are known to be malicious. However, given that they're part of an expected package resource, it's more likely normal.\n\n- The winlogbeat file is also non-malicious; it's a common log management tool, so its activity is expected and not indicative of any issues.\n\nPotential reasons for concern:\n\n- If these files were being created outside of the expected paths or in system directories, that could be suspicious. But here, they're all within user app data and downloads, which are standard locations.\n\n- No evidence of file deletions, unauthorized access attempts, or other signs like multiple failed login attempts or process injections are present in these logs.\n\n- The duplication of certain file creations (each appears twice) might indicate an issue with the installation process, but it's not necessarily malicious. It could be retry logic in case of a temporary failure.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAfter reviewing all events and considering each process's normal behavior, I don't see any signs of malicious activity or unauthorized access. The activities are consistent with legitimate software operations, such as installing updates for Microsoft Office and setting up log management tools.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities related to Microsoft Office language packages and log management tool setup, indicating no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, all the events have the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's consistent across all entries, which is good because it tells me that whatever is happening is coming from the same source. Now, looking at the winlog task, they're all labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So this means each event is a notification that a file was created.\n\nThe next part to look at is the file paths. Each entry has a different path, but I notice some patterns. The paths are all under the user's AppData Local folder within Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. Specifically, there are two package IDs: \"36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b\" and \"f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2\". These look like they might be identifiers for specific Office add-ins or packages.\n\nLooking at the file names, they all seem to be JavaScript files with various prefixes like \"hr-hr-ui-strings-json\", \"hu-hu-ui-strings-json\", and others. These appear to be language-specific resource files, perhaps used by Microsoft Office for different locales. The naming pattern suggests they're part of a localization package.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the repetition: each file path is unique but follows a similar structure. For example, \"hr-hr-ui-strings-json_47403e608f496138f88d554c77fa98b0.js\" occurs twice, as does \"hu-hu-ui-strings-json_456939140fc0a60434b700e7e3a76200.js\", and others. This repetition makes me think that these are legitimate files being created during the operation of Office, possibly when an add-in or package is installed or updated.\n\nAnother point to consider is the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\". I'm not entirely sure what this process does. It might be part of a legitimate system tool or perhaps associated with some third-party software. To check, I can think about common processes related to Office. SDX might stand for something like \"Setup\" or \"Scripting\", but without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nLooking at the timestamps isn't possible here since they're not provided, but if these events are all happening in quick succession, that could be a red flag. However, given that they're creating files in an Office-related directory, it might just be part of a normal update or installation process.\n\nI also notice that some file paths point to \"OfflineFiles\", which suggests these are cached or downloaded resources, possibly for offline use within Office applications. This is common behavior for software trying to provide localized content without internet access.\n\nSo putting this all together: multiple instances of the same process creating files in a known Microsoft Office directory structure with language-specific resource names. While it's possible that an attacker could misuse SDXHelper.exe, there's nothing obviously malicious here at first glance. The events look like they're part of standard operations, perhaps during an update or installation of Office add-ins.\n\nHowever, the fact that all these files are being created in quick succession might still be worth investigating. If this is a legitimate process, it should be expected and logged properly. But if there's no prior knowledge of SDXHelper.exe performing such actions, it could indicate something unusual. \n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events seem to fit normal Office operations, but I have some uncertainty about the legitimacy of the process name. If more context or additional logs were available, that might change my assessment.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a Microsoft Office-related directory, likely part of normal operations for localized resources.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down.\n\nLooking at the first set of events, there are seven entries all from \"EXCEL.EXE\" with the task being \"Registry value set\". That seems normal because Excel might be modifying registry settings during operation, like enabling features or adjusting configurations. I don't see any immediate red flags here unless this activity is unusual in the specific environment.\n\nNext, there's a series of events from \"SDXHelper.exe\". The tasks are \"File created\" and each points to different file paths under the user's AppData directory within Microsoft Office Solution Packages. These files have names like \"kok-in-ui-strings-json\" and \"transcription-strings.min.js\", which sound like resource files for language translations or UI strings. Since these files are part of an Office package, it seems plausible that they're being created as part of the normal setup or update process.\n\nI should consider whether such events could be indicative of malicious activity. SDXHelper.exe is a known component used by Microsoft to manage Office add-ins and settings, so its activities are typically legitimate. The creation of these files doesn't seem suspicious on the surface—they look like they're part of the expected behavior for language support or feature updates.\n\nHowever, I should also think about context.
