Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL format, each line is a separate event. All events have similar structures: process name \"SDXHelper.exe\", task as \"File created\" from the Windows log, and a file path in \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\".\n\nThe process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" stands out. I'm not immediately familiar with this process, so I should check if it's a known legitimate application or possibly malicious. A quick search tells me that SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office updates and solutions, which suggests it's part of Microsoft's software.\n\nNext, the task is \"File created,\" which indicates that files are being written to the filesystem. The file paths point to \"PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\" within the user's AppData directory. These seem like standard locations for storing application resources or cached data, especially for Office products.\n\nEach event creates a different JavaScript file with varying filenames. This could be normal if the application is updating or installing new resources. The repeated pattern of two events creating each JS file suggests that maybe there was an attempt to write these files twice, possibly due to retry logic in case of failures.\n\nI don't notice any unusual indicators here. No signs of unexpected process creation, network connections, or access to restricted areas. All activities are within expected bounds for an Office-related process managing its resources.\n\nGiven this analysis, the events don't raise red flags. They appear to be legitimate operations by a known Microsoft-associated process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events from a legitimate Microsoft Office process in a standard location.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first line: It shows a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating a file in a specific path. The same pattern repeats for multiple lines—each time, SDXHelper is creating a different JavaScript file in the same directory structure under Office's SolutionPackages. \n\nI notice that each event is almost identical except for the filename part. The filenames have varying suffixes like _a447e403fce55f0d8f880238761b0c85.js and others. This suggests that it's a sequence of file creation events by the same process.\n\nNow, considering what I know about such processes: SDXHelper.exe is often related to Microsoft Office, specifically for managing add-ins or solution packages. The path mentioned (AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office) aligns with typical locations where Office stores its data and add-in files. The fact that multiple JavaScript files are being created could be part of normal operations when initializing or updating add-ons, especially in an Office context.\n\nIs there anything unusual here? I don't see any signs of malicious activity like file creation from unknown processes or access to restricted areas. All events are under the user's AppData directory and within expected Office-related folders. The repetition might indicate a legitimate process, perhaps during an update or installation of Office components.\n\nI should also consider whether multiple identical events could be a red flag. However, in this case, it seems normal since these files are part of Office's operation. If there were variations, like different file types or locations, that might raise suspicion, but here everything is consistent.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities described appear to be standard operations performed by a legitimate Microsoft Office-related process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions by SDXHelper.exe, which is a known legitimate process related to Microsoft Office.

Each event has three main parts: process info, a Windows log task, and file details.\n\nFirst, the process name is always \"SDXHelper.exe\". I recognize that as a legitimate Microsoft Office-related process, used for handling updates or package resources. That doesn't immediately raise any red flags because it's a known system process.\n\nNext, each event has the same task in the Windows log: \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So, every single one of these is a file creation event triggered by SDXHelper.exe. Now, if I see multiple instances of files being created by a legitimate process, it might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to the same directory structure under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\". The filenames vary but follow a pattern like \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_*.js\". These look like JavaScript files related to Excel's Copilot feature, which is part of Microsoft Office. The naming convention seems consistent with how packages might store resources offline.\n\nNow, considering the number of events: there are 14 instances here. It seems like a lot of file creations in quick succession. However, given that these are all under an expected directory and involve known processes, it could just be normal operation when Office is updating or syncing its resources, especially for features like Copilot which might require multiple files to operate.\n\nI don't see any indicators here of malicious behavior. The process is legitimate, the task is standard (file creation), and the location is within a user-specific app data folder where such operations are expected. There's no evidence of file paths leading to system directories or writes to unexpected locations. Also, the repetition of similar filenames doesn't suggest anything irregular; it could be part of how the Copilot resources are structured.\n\nSo, putting this all together: the events don't show any signs of malicious activity.

The files are all JavaScript files located in a path under the user's AppData directory, specifically within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages.\n\nHmm, first thing that comes to mind is what SDXHelper.exe does. I'm not too familiar with it off the top of my head, but given the context, it's probably related to Office add-ins or solution packages since they're under Microsoft Office's directory structure. The files being created are JavaScript files named with GUIDs or hashes in their names, which is typical for packaged resources.\n\nI notice that each event is almost identical except for the file paths. They all involve SDXHelper.exe creating a new file in the same directory but different filenames. Since all events are from the same process and target these specific JS files, it doesn't look like there's any malicious activity here. It seems more like normal operation, possibly during an update or installation of some Office-related components.\n\nThe fact that multiple files are being created with similar names suggests that maybe this is part of a larger package deployment. The repetition could be due to multiple resources being added as part of the same process. There's no indication of unusual access times, paths leading outside the expected directories, or other red flags like writes to system folders.\n\nI don't see any signs of privilege escalation, injection attempts, or network communication that would typically indicate malicious behavior.

Let me start by looking through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few entries all have the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" and are about creating files in a specific path under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office...\". These seem to be multiple file creation events for different JavaScript files, all related to Excel Copilot. I notice that each event has a unique file path but the same parent directory. Since these are files created by an Office-related process, they might just be normal operations—like saving or updating resources.\n\nThen there's an event where \"MdSched.exe\" is started. From what I remember, MdSched is related to Windows Defender and scans for malware, so it's a legitimate system process. It shouldn't raise any red flags.\n\nAnother event involves \"consent.exe\" loading some DLLs like amsi.dll and urlmon.dll. These are standard Windows components, used for things like URL handling and anti-malware scanning interface, so they're likely benign.\n\nThere's also an entry from \"winlogbeat.exe\", which I believe is part of the ELK stack for log management. It's creating a new config file in the data directory, which makes sense if the system is running that tool.\n\nLooking at all these events together, they don't show any signs of malicious activity. The repeated file creations by SDXHelper could be normal Office operations. There's no indication of unauthorized access, unusual process behavior, or anomalies like multiple failed attempts or writes to unexpected locations. All processes are either legitimate system tools or parts of Microsoft Office.\n\nI should also consider if there's anything missing. For example, the absence of network connections, external drives access, or changes to sensitive files might be a clue, but in this case, everything seems contained within standard directories and processes.\n\nSo, after reviewing all events, I don't see any evidence that would classify this batch as interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by legitimate processes like Office-related components and system utilities.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the process name is consistently \"SDXHelper.exe\" in every event. That's interesting because I know that legitimate software sometimes uses helper processes for various tasks. So maybe this is part of normal operations.\n\nNext, each event has a task labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This suggests that the system is logging file creation events. It makes sense if an application is installing or updating files, it would create new ones during that process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to the same directory structure within the user's AppData folder. The path includes \"Microsoft Office\", \"SolutionPackages\", and specific GUIDs followed by filenames ending with .js. These look like JavaScript files which are commonly used in web-based or Office add-ins.\n\nI notice that multiple entries have similar file paths but different filenames, each with varying hashes at the end (like dd5cf83abd6a170ac722a935abcf684d.js). This repetition makes me think that this might be part of a larger process where several files are being created or updated.\n\nNow, considering potential malicious activity: unusual processes creating files could indicate something suspicious. But in this case, the same process is consistently creating files in an expected location for Microsoft Office-related packages. The files themselves are .js files, which aren't inherently malicious but can be used as part of attacks if they're malicious scripts.\n\nHowever, given that these events are all from the same process and located within a standard user directory for Office add-ins or components, it doesn't raise immediate red flags. It's possible that this is related to an update or installation of Copilot features in Excel since some filenames mention \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\".\n\nI should also consider whether multiple identical events could be indicative of something suspicious, like a script generating many log entries. But again, if it's part of the normal setup process for Office add-ins, especially with updates or installations, this would make sense.\n\nAnother angle is checking the timestamps of these events to see how close together they occurred. If they're all within a short timeframe, it might suggest an automated process, which could be either legitimate (like an update) or potentially malicious. But without exact time data, I can't say for sure.\n\nIn summary, while each individual event doesn't seem suspicious on its own, the fact that multiple identical events are occurring with the same process and in a known Microsoft Office directory makes me lean towards it being non-malicious. However, there's a slight chance if these files are actually malicious scripts that were deployed en masse, but without more context, I can't confirm that.\n\nI'll give this a confidence score of 0.8 because while the events look routine, the repeated creation of multiple files by the same process could warrant closer monitoring in certain contexts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events from SDXHelper.exe in a Microsoft Office-related directory suggest normal operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at each JSON object, they all have the same structure: a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\", a file creation event from Windows logs, and the file path points to various JavaScript files in an Office Solution Packages directory under the user's AppData folder.\n\nI know that SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Office. It’s used for managing updates and solution packages, so it's part of normal Office operations. The task is a FileCreate event, which means a new file was created. That seems pretty standard since applications often create temporary or cache files when they run.\n\nThe file paths all end with .js, which are JavaScript files. These could be part of the Office add-ins or web-based components that Office uses. OfflineFiles suggests these might be cached for use when online access isn't available. The directory structure looks legitimate—Microsoft offices Solution Packages and OfflineFiles subfolders are standard places where Office stores such resources.\n\nI notice that many events are duplicates, like repeated file creations of the same JS files. This could happen if the system is re-indexing or caching these files multiple times, which can be normal behavior for applications, especially after updates or when starting up.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (even though they aren't provided here), if these events happened in quick succession or across several log entries, it might indicate something unusual. But without that context, I can't say for sure. The files being created are all under Microsoft's own package GUIDs and file hashes, which don't raise red flags.\n\nI also consider the possibility of malicious activity. Malware often creates files in unexpected locations or uses different naming conventions. Here, everything seems to fit within Office's expected behavior. There's no indication of execution, deletion, or access patterns that would suggest compromise.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that all events come from the same process and are related to file creation doesn't point to any suspicious activities like privilege escalation or data exfiltration. It’s more about resource management by a legitimate application component.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's important to monitor for unexpected processes or unusual file accesses, this batch of logs appears to be normal background activity from Microsoft Office components caching necessary resources.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe, a legitimate Microsoft Office process, creating JavaScript files in expected locations.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is a JSON object, and there are multiple lines, each representing one event. My task is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. \n\nFirst, let me look at what each event contains. The structure seems consistent across all entries. Each JSON object has three main parts: process, winlog, and file.\n\nThe \"process\" field always shows {\"name\":\"SDXHelper.exe\"}. SDXHelper.exe is known to be a legitimate Microsoft Office component used for managing Solution Packages, which are add-ins or customizations for Excel. So, this isn't some unknown or suspicious process; it's part of the standard Microsoft Office setup.\n\nNext, the \"winlog\" field indicates that a file was created, specifically with the task \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This is a typical Windows event indicating the creation of a new file, which in itself isn't unusual. It's a common log entry and usually not an immediate red flag unless it's happening under certain suspicious circumstances.\n\nLooking at the \"file\" field, each event points to a different JavaScript file located in the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. The filenames vary, but they all follow a pattern like excel-copilot-strings followed by various hexadecimal strings. These look like unique identifiers for each file.\n\nI notice that the same files are being created twice in a row in some events. For example, one event creates excel-copilot-strings_006c486299344434e703f696d84d293b.js and then another event immediately does the same. This duplication might be a clue. Perhaps it's an error in how files are being handled, or maybe the system is retrying after a failure.\n\nHowever, considering that these are part of Microsoft Office's Solution Packages, this could be normal behavior during updates or installations of add-ins. The process SDXHelper.exe is responsible for managing these packages, so creating multiple JavaScript files might be part of the standard operation, especially if there are several add-ins being processed.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many different files? It seems like a lot, but in reality, each add-in could have its own set of resources, including JavaScript files. So having numerous entries might just be indicative of multiple add-ins being loaded or updated.\n\nAnother point to consider is the path structure. The presence of \"OfflineFiles\" suggests that these are cached copies of files used when offline. This is a common practice for Office applications to allow functionality without an internet connection, so it's not inherently suspicious.\n\nI should also check if there are any anomalies in the timestamps or other metadata. Since each event is identical except for the file path, and they're all coming from the same process, it seems consistent. There’s no indication of unusual times (like late at night) unless I have context on normal office usage hours.\n\nIs SDXHelper.exe known to be involved in any malicious activities? From what I recall, it's a legitimate component, so its activity alone doesn't raise flags. However, if there were deviations from normal behavior, like creating files in unexpected locations or with unusual names, that could be concerning.\n\nIn this case, all the file paths are within expected directories for Office packages, and the filenames follow a predictable pattern. The repeated creation of the same files might just be due to the process trying to set up multiple add-ins or resources, especially if there was a hiccup in an earlier attempt.\n\nI should also think about whether this kind of activity is common during system updates or patches. Sometimes, after a Windows update or Office update, components might reset or reinitialize, leading to creation of new files as part of the configuration process.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while it's always good to be cautious with logs, especially in cybersecurity, there doesn't seem to be any clear indicators of malicious behavior here. The events are repetitive and fit within normal operations expected from Office components managing their add-ins.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file creation activities by the Microsoft Office component SDXHelper.exe as part of managing Solution Packages, which is a normal operation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The terms \"copilotchat\" and \"excel-copilot\" suggest these are JavaScript files related to Microsoft Copilot features in Excel. Copilot is a feature that provides AI assistance within Office applications, so it makes sense that these files are part of its functionality.\n\nThe pattern here is consistent: multiple entries with the same process creating similar types of files in known directories.

Typically, malicious activities might involve creating files in unexpected locations, using unfamiliar names, or having processes that aren't common on the system. In this case, everything points to legitimate Microsoft-related operations, which are expected during updates or feature installations.\n\nAnother angle: The paths include \"OfflineFiles\", which often means these are cached or stored for offline use. This is standard behavior for applications to ensure functionality without an internet connection. So, creating several files here wouldn't raise red flags as they're part of the intended design.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual access times, multiple failed attempts, or other anomalies that might suggest a breach or unauthorized activity.

The task from the winlog is \"File created\", and each file path points to different JavaScript files within the same directory structure under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages.\n\nHmm, first thought: SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar. I think it's related to Microsoft Defender or some system tool because I've seen similar names before in legitimate software. It might be part of the system's security mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all have \"OfflineFiles\" and filenames like excel-copilot-strings followed by various hashes. These look like resource files for an Office add-in or Copilot feature, which is Microsoft's AI assistant for Excel. So each event is about creating a new file in this OfflineFiles directory.\n\nI'm noticing that many of these events are duplicates. Each exact same path appears twice except the last one, which also repeats once. That makes me think that maybe there was an issue where multiple instances or retries happened when trying to create these files. Or perhaps it's part of a normal process where several files need to be set up during an Office session.\n\nIs there anything suspicious here? Well, all events are from the same process and seem to follow a pattern typical of legitimate file creation for application resources. The paths don't indicate any hidden or unusual locations beyond standard user app data directories. No signs of executable files being created, which is often a red flag, just JS files.\n\nI'm also considering whether multiple identical events could be an indicator of something malicious. But in this case, since it's part of the Microsoft Office setup and they are offline resources for Copilot, it seems expected that several files might need to be created or accessed during runtime.\n\nAnother angle: Could this be a persistence mechanism? Well, if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, creating these files wouldn't indicate persistence.

It's part of the Office suite and handles things like setup and updates. So this process creating files sounds normal for it to operate.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all end with .js, which are JavaScript files. The names seem consistent—each has a unique identifier but follows a pattern: \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_[some_hash].js.\" This looks like part of the Office setup or perhaps some AI-related features, maybe Copilots in newer versions of Office.\n\nEach event is almost identical except for the file name. So this suggests that multiple JavaScript files are being created by SDXHelper.exe as part of its regular operation. Since these are part of Microsoft's own package resources, they're likely legitimate and not malicious.\n\nI should consider whether such activity would be considered suspicious. Typically, during software updates or installations, applications create temporary or cache files. In this case, creating several JS files doesn't raise any red flags because it's expected behavior for Office to manage its resources.\n\nIs there anything unusual about the number of events? There are 14 events in total, each creating a different JS file. While that might seem like a lot, if SDXHelper.exe is installing or updating multiple components, especially with features like Copilot which might have several language files or resources, it's plausible.\n\nI also think about whether the path structure is normal. The location under AppData and within Microsoft Office seems standard for where such packages would be stored. There's no indication of any writes to unexpected locations or attempts to access sensitive areas beyond what's typical for an office application.\n\nAnother point is that all events are file creation events, which might not necessarily indicate malicious activity on their own. Malicious actors often use deletion or modification events more than just creating files, unless they're setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nI should also check if SDXHelper.exe is known to have any malicious activities. From what I know, it's a legitimate component used for Office updates and patches, so there's no evidence suggesting it's being used here for anything harmful.\n\nPutting it all together: the same process creating several files in a standard location with predictable filenames doesn't seem concerning.

The paths are all under the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\... and then specific package resources for offline files. All the filenames start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by different hashes, which likely indicate different versions or builds of the file.\n\nSo, each event is a File Created task from Windows, initiated by SDXHelper.exe. The same process creating multiple files might be normal if this is part of its legitimate operation, like during software updates or cache refreshes. However, since all these events are exactly the same except for the filename hashes, it seems repetitive and possibly systematic.\n\nI wonder what SDXHelper.exe does. It could be a helper process for Microsoft Office solutions packages. If that's the case, creating multiple JavaScript files in an OfflineFiles directory might be standard behavior when the software is updating or syncing content offline. The fact that there are multiple identical events (e.g., two entries with each hash) suggests it's part of a routine process.\n\nI'm considering if this kind of activity would typically indicate malicious behavior. Unusual file creation could be a sign, but in this case, since all files are under a known Microsoft Office directory and the filenames follow a predictable pattern, it seems more like legitimate operations. Unless there's evidence that SDXHelper.exe is known for malicious activities, which I don't have here.\n\nMoreover, having multiple entries of the same file creation might be due to retries or parallel processes writing these files, which isn't uncommon in software installations or updates. There doesn't seem to be any deviation from expected patterns; no hidden files, execution of scripts, or other red flags.\n\nSo, after evaluating all events together, they don't collectively indicate malicious behavior.

Let me start by looking at the structure of these events.\n\nEach event has three main parts: process information, Windows log details, and file details. The process name is consistently \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's interesting because I know that legitimate software often has helper processes, but sometimes malicious actors use such names to blend in.\n\nThe task from the Windows log is always \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means each event is about a new file being created. The files are all located under the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\". Specifically, they're in the SolutionPackages directory, and within that, there's an ID folder followed by OfflineFiles.\n\nLooking at the filenames, they all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" and have varying hash-like suffixes. These look like static resource files, possibly JavaScript or similar. The repetition of these file paths suggests that multiple such files are being created in quick succession, maybe during an Office update or some other legitimate process.\n\nNow, considering the user context—fiddelis is the username. It's a common enough name, so nothing suspicious there on first glance. But seeing all these files being written by the same process makes me think—are these normal operations? I know that software updates sometimes extract multiple files, especially if they're resources or cache files.\n\nBut wait, SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar. Let me think—could it be part of a legitimate Microsoft tool or something else? A quick mental note: \"SDX\" might stand for something related to system diagnostics or management. If it's from Microsoft, that would make sense, as they often have helper tools.\n\nOn the other hand, if this were malicious, these files could potentially be components of a larger payload. But given that all events are file creations without any deletions or modifications immediately following, and since the files seem to be static resources under an Office directory, it's more likely part of a legitimate update process.\n\nThe fact that each event is almost identical except for the filename makes me think it's automated—maybe part of a script or installation routine. The repetitive nature could indicate either a normal batch operation or something trying to write multiple files quickly, perhaps evading detection mechanisms.\n\nI also notice that all these events are happening in the same directory structure. That consistency suggests a controlled process rather than random file creation across different locations, which might be more indicative of malicious activity.\n\nHowever, I'm cautious because sometimes attackers use legitimate processes or mimic known behaviors to avoid suspicion. But without any additional indicators like permission changes, access times outside normal hours, or anomalies in timestamps beyond the quantity, it's harder to see a red flag here.\n\nThe confidence level is high that this isn't malicious because all elements point towards standard file creation during an update or cache refresh.

So, this process is creating multiple files. The paths in the file field show that the files are being created within the \"OfflineFiles\" directory under the user's AppData folder.

The fact that it's creating multiple files in an Office-related directory makes me think these are part of some package resources, maybe for add-ins or language packs.\n\nBut why so many files being created? Each file has a unique name ending with .js, which suggests JavaScript files. These could be static resources used by the Office application when running offline. It's common for applications to cache such resources to work without an internet connection.\n\nNow, considering security, are these activities suspicious? Well, legitimate processes often create multiple files as part of their operation, especially during setup or updates. The use of predictable naming conventions in the filenames doesn't raise any red flags.

This repetition suggests automated processing rather than manual intervention or malicious activity.\n\nI don't see any indicators of compromise here, like access to sensitive directories, writes to unexpected locations, or unusual file names beyond what's typical for cached JS files. The process name is consistent across all events, so no signs of process spoofing or multiple processes being involved.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to monitor such activities, there's nothing in these logs that stands out as malicious or concerning. It seems like standard operation for the software related to Microsoft Office.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe creating cached JavaScript files in a known Microsoft Office directory, indicating normal operation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, all the events are similar: they're generated by \"SDXHelper.exe\", which is part of Microsoft Office, right? The log entries indicate that files were created in specific paths within the user's AppData directory. These seem to be JavaScript files related to Office and Word Copilot resources.\n\nHmm, I know that Microsoft Office often creates temporary or cache files when running. So, seeing multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe isn't unusual. The paths look legitimate—like where Office would store its offline content or solution packages.\n\nWait, but why are there so many duplicate entries? Like, some of the same JS files are being created twice. That might just be normal caching behavior if the system is re-downloading resources or if the log captures the same event multiple times. It doesn't necessarily indicate malicious activity.\n\nAlso, all events come from the same process and the same user (fiddelis). There's no indication of unusual access patterns or permissions changes. No failed logins, no access to restricted areas—just file creations in expected locations.\n\nI should consider if SDXHelper.exe is known for any suspicious behavior. From what I recall, it's a legitimate component used by Office for managing add-ins and solutions. So unless there's an unusual version or some signs of tampering, it's probably not malicious here.\n\nThe file paths are deep within the user profile, which is standard for app data. Malware often targets different directories or creates files in more common locations like Program Files or Windows system folders. Here, everything stays within the user's AppData, which aligns with expected behavior.\n\nAnother angle: Could these be indicators of something else, like a plugin or script being loaded? But again, since it's part of Office's normal operation, especially with features like Copilot, it's likely just how Office handles its resources when running.\n\nI don't see any evidence of file hashes or other attributes that would raise red flags. The files are named with hashes and minified JS, which is typical for cached web assets to reduce payload size and improve performance.\n\nSo putting it all together: same process creating multiple files in expected locations, no signs of unauthorized access, normal caching behavior from a legitimate component. No reason to suspect this batch as malicious or deserving further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of JavaScript files by Microsoft Office's SDXHelper.exe process during normal operation, indicating standard caching behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event on the system. The first thing that stands out is that every single event has the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's interesting because it suggests that all these activities are originating from the same executable.\n\nNext, the task in each event is labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So, this indicates that each of these events is a file creation event. The files are being created in the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\" with various filenames, all following a pattern like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_[some hash].js\".\n\nLooking closer at the file paths, they are nested deep within the Office Solution Packages directory. The specific path seems to be related to offline files for an AI copilot feature of Microsoft Office. Each filename has a unique hash, but the base name is consistent across all events.\n\nNow, considering the nature of these files—they're JavaScript files named \"officeaicopilot-strings.min.js\"—it makes me think they could be part of a legitimate update or caching mechanism for an AI feature within Office. However, the fact that multiple identical file creation events are occurring with different hashes might raise some flags.\n\nI wonder why there are two entries for each file. It looks like each file is being created twice. That duplication could indicate an issue with how the files are being handled—maybe a retry mechanism after a failure or perhaps something more nefarious, like multiple attempts to write files in a way that's trying to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the naming convention of the files. The hashes in the filenames might be unique identifiers for each version or instance of these strings. But seeing them all being created by the same process makes me consider whether this is part of a legitimate update process or if it's something else, like an attempt to write multiple malicious files.\n\nI should also think about the source of \"SDXHelper.exe\". I'm not immediately familiar with that executable, but given that it's creating files in an Office directory, it might be part of some legitimate software component. However, without knowing for sure, it could potentially be a sign of suspicious activity if this process is behaving outside its usual parameters.\n\nThe repetition and the specific location where the files are being created make me cautious. While it's possible that these are just updates or cache files from Microsoft Office itself, the fact that they're all created by the same process in quick succession could suggest something more malicious, like a script or tool trying to drop multiple files as part of an attack.\n\nOn the other hand, legitimate software updates do sometimes involve creating new files, especially if there are retries or parallel processes involved. But the duplication here is notable, and combined with the specific naming pattern, it might indicate that this isn't just a simple file creation but something more structured.\n\nIn terms of indicators of compromise (IoCs), having multiple identical events with slight variations in filenames could be part of an attack where an adversary is attempting to bypass detection by creating files with different names each time. Alternatively, if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known malicious software, this activity would certainly be concerning.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility that these are legitimate activities. Microsoft Office does have features like AI Copilot that might require such files for functionality. But given the number of events and the duplication, it seems excessive unless there's a specific reason for creating each file twice.\n\nTo determine whether this is interesting or not, I need to assess how unusual this activity is. If \"SDXHelper.exe\" isn't known as a malicious process and these files are indeed part of an Office feature, then maybe it's not suspicious. However, if there's no clear reason for this pattern, especially the duplication and multiple writes, it could be a red flag.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a possibility that these events are legitimate, the combination of repeated file creation by the same process in such a specific path with duplicate entries raises concerns about potential malicious activity. Therefore, further investigation would be warranted to determine the true nature of \"SDXHelper.exe\" and its activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in an Office-related path suggest potential suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let me start by looking at what's in each event.\n\nEach line seems to be a JSON object representing an event. The key components are:\n\n- **Process**: The name is \"SDXHelper.exe\". That sounds familiar—it might be related to Microsoft Office, maybe part of the Copilot feature that assists with writing or other tasks.\n  \n- **Winlog Task**: It's indicating a \"File created\" event under the rule \"FileCreate\". So each event is about a file being created.\n\n- **File Path**: All the files are located in \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\\OfflineFiles\\\". The specific filenames vary, but they all end with .js and have long hashes in their names. For example, \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_e4c0785d28a655cfa8c7e561caea1f62.js\".\n\nLooking at the batch as a whole, I notice that there are multiple entries with the same file paths but different hashes. It seems like each event is creating a new JavaScript file in an Office-related directory. The process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" is consistent across all events.\n\nI should consider whether this behavior is normal. Microsoft Office applications often have helper processes, and it's common for them to create temporary or cache files. These .js files might be part of the Copilot feature's resources. \n\nThe repetition of file creation events could be a sign that Copilot is downloading or caching JavaScript strings, which would make sense during operation. Since all these files are in expected locations and from an Office process, this doesn't seem unusual.\n\nHowever, sometimes attackers use legitimate processes for malicious activities, so I should check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known to be benign. From what I recall, it's part of Microsoft's tools, so it's less likely to be malicious here.\n\nAnother point: all events are file creations without any other actions like deletions or modifications. If there were attempts to access or execute these files, that might raise flags, but as it stands, it's just creating them.\n\nThe paths and filenames don't show any red flags, such as being in system directories or having names typical of malware. The hashes are consistent with static content, not dynamic code which could be malicious.\n\nConsidering all this, the events look like standard operations related to Microsoft Office features. There's no evidence of unusual behavior, so I classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions by the SDXHelper.exe process within expected Microsoft Office directories. These appear to be legitimate cache or resource files related to Office features.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. My task is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's relevant for investigation. The output should be a single classification: either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nLooking at the events, I notice that each one has similar structures but let me parse them carefully. Each event seems to involve a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\". The winlog field indicates that a file was created, following a specific rule called \"FileCreate\". The file paths are all within the user's AppData directory under Microsoft Office Solution Packages, and they end with .js file extensions.\n\nHmm, first, I should consider what SDXHelper.exe is. Maybe it's a legitimate system or application helper process? I'm not entirely sure, but I don't recall it being a known malicious actor off the top of my head. Next, looking at the file creation events: creating files in the AppData directory isn't inherently suspicious because many applications store data there, especially Office-related ones.\n\nThe repeated nature of these events—each one is almost identical except for the specific file paths—is something to note. It might just be that the same process is creating several JavaScript files during its operation. Since they are all under Microsoft's Office packages, it's possible these are legitimate resources being downloaded or cached.\n\nI should also think about the possibility of redundant events. Sometimes logs can have multiple entries for the same action if it's part of a normal process flow. If SDXHelper.exe is related to Office, maybe it's updating or installing new features, which would explain why several files are created in quick succession.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the file names. They all end with .js and have long GUID-like prefixes. This seems consistent with JavaScript files used by Office add-ins or solutions packages. Since these are stored in OfflineFiles, it suggests they're being accessed locally when online resources aren't available. That sounds normal for an application trying to work offline.\n\nAre there any red flags? The process name is not a common one I recognize as malware. Malicious processes often have names designed to blend in or mimic legitimate ones, but SDXHelper doesn't immediately ring a bell as something bad. Also, creating multiple JS files could be part of normal operations for an Office add-in.\n\nI should also consider the frequency. There are 8 events here, all within a short period. If these were spread out over time, it might not be suspicious, but in this batch, they're sequential. However, if SDXHelper is running as part of an update or background process, creating several files at once makes sense.\n\nI'm trying to remember if there are known attack vectors related to Office Solution Packages. I think some have been exploited, but those are usually vulnerabilities within Office itself rather than the package storage. Unless these JS files contain malicious code, which isn't evident from their names alone.\n\nIn summary, while each individual event seems benign, the combination doesn't raise red flags. The same process creating several JS files in a standard location for its operation likely isn't malicious. Without indicators of compromise (like known malicious file hashes or unusual access patterns), it's hard to justify classifying this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show the SDXHelper.exe process creating several JavaScript files in a standard location related to Microsoft Office. These appear to be legitimate operations for an application helper process.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
