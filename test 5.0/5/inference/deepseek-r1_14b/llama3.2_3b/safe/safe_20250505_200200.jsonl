{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. That seems normal since it's part of the logging setup. The second event shows ssh.exe creating a known_hosts file, which is standard for SSH clients to store host keys.\n\nNext, powershell.exe loading mscoree.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so nothing suspicious there. Then, there's a provider lifecycle event from PowerShell, which could be part of its normal operation.\n\nThe seventh event stands out: powershell.exe logging a file delete for a script in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1. This looks like an unusual activity because scripts with random names and located in temporary folders might indicate something malicious, especially if they're being deleted after execution.\n\nLooking at the confidence level: the presence of a PowerShell process deleting a file that's not commonly seen adds some concern, but it's not definitive proof of malware. So, I'd rate this as 0.7 because while it's concerning, more context is needed.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes an unusual file deletion event involving a PowerShell process removing a script file with a random name in the Temp directory, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
