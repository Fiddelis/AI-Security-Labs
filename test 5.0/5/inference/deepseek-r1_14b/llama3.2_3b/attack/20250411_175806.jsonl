{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst event: whoami.exe is being executed. That's a common system info tool, usually harmless unless part of something else. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessed. Powershell can be used both good and bad. Alone, it doesn't raise flags but could be part of malicious activity if combined with other actions.\n\nThird event: cmd.exe is run with a command to add a registry entry. The command line shows adding \"registro_auxiliar\" pointing to C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware, so this is a red flag.\n\nFourth event: cmd.exe again, setting another registry value under HKCU\\Run. This looks like an attempt to create a persistent startup entry which could indicate malicious activity trying to run on each login.\n\nFifth event: reg.exe used to add another registry entry pointing to pacote_temporario.exe. Using reg.exe directly is less common and might be suspicious, especially if the path is unusual.\n\nSixth and seventh events: conhost.exe and cmd.exe both modifying the registry again. Conhost is typically for command line processing; combining this with multiple registry changes strengthens suspicion of malicious intent.\n\nEighth event: powershell accessed againâ€”could be part of a script or remote execution, which raises concerns about potential attacks.\n\nLast event: winlogbeat creating a file. Winlogbeat is legitimate software for log management. This seems normal unless it's being used in an unusual way.\n\nPutting it all together, the recurring cmd.exe and reg.exe commands with multiple registry modifications are concerning. These actions can be part of installing malware or creating persistence points. The use of different processes to make these changes adds to the suspicion. While each event on its own might not be alarming, their combination suggests potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications detected across multiple processes (cmd.exe, reg.exe) adding entries that may indicate persistence mechanisms or malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
