Also, the Pipe Created event could indicate communication between processes, which isn't always bad, but in this context might be suspicious.\n\nMultiple ProcessAccess events and Registry value changes with PowerShell could suggest someone is trying to modify system settings or access sensitive information. The repeated creation and deletion of files in Temp might be an attempt to hide activities. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of accessing remote shares, loading .NET components, creating and deleting temp files, and registry changes points to possible malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events related to 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. Let me check the specific tasks.\n\nThere's a 'File created' event in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for malware to store temporary files. Then, there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .dll files, some of which are part of .NET Framework and Windows Defender. While some of these are legitimate, loading multiple system DLLs might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a 'Process Create' event for 'cmd.exe' with the command to disable the Windows firewall using 'netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off'. Disabling the firewall is a clear indicator of malicious intent. That's a strong sign of a security threat.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Registry value set' and 'Registry object added or deleted' events, which could indicate changes to system settings or attempts to hide the malware's presence. \n\nHowever, some of the events are from 'svchost.exe', which is a normal system process. But the combination of disabling the firewall, creating files in user directories, and loading various DLLs might be part of a larger attack. \n\nThe presence of 'File Delete logged' for a temporary PowerShell script might be part of cleanup, which is common in malware. \n\nPutting this all together, the key suspicious events are the firewall disable command and the file creation in AppData. While some events are normal, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. I should classify this as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including file creation in user AppData, registry modifications, and attempts to disable Windows firewall via cmd.exe. These actions are commonly associated with malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to svchost.exe performing registry operations. The task is \"Registry object added or deleted\" repeated multiple times. But svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that might be suspicious, especially if it's not part of normal system behavior. But I need to check if there's anything else here.\n\nLooking further down, there are some PowerShell commands. The command line shows \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\". Wait, \"unidade_auxiliar\" is Portuguese for \"auxiliary unit\", which might be a red flag. Also, the command is creating a new PSDrive pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$, which looks like a network share, possibly a remote system's C$ drive. That's often used in attacks to access remote machines.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These are related to PowerShell providers and engine events. The fact that these commands are being executed multiple times could indicate an attempt to establish a persistent connection or manipulate the registry on a remote system.\n\nAlso, the repetition of the same command lines suggests automation or scripting. The presence of both registry events and PowerShell commands that access remote drives might indicate a coordinated attack, such as lateral movement within a network or data exfiltration.\n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these events could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. But the combination of multiple registry changes, PowerShell commands accessing remote drives, and the use of non-English terms like \"unidade_auxiliar\" might point to malicious activity. The confidence here is moderate because while some events are normal, the combination and repetition are suspicious. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple svchost.exe registry events combined with PowerShell commands creating network drives to \\\\Target\\\\C$ suggest potential lateral movement or remote access attempts.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are five entries here, all related to PowerShell processes. The command line is the same in each: they're checking if a file named procdump.exe exists in a specific path. The path is C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..\\registro_secundario\\procdump.exe. Wait, the path uses ..\\ which is a directory traversal. That might be a red flag because it's trying to access a file in a parent directory, which could be an attempt to bypass security measures or access files that shouldn't be accessible.\n\nNow, procdump.exe is a legitimate tool from Sysinternals, but it's also sometimes used by attackers to dump memory from processes, which can be part of malware activities. However, just checking if the file exists doesn't necessarily mean it's malicious. But the repetition of the same command across multiple logs might indicate some automated checking, maybe part of a script or a tool that's looking for the presence of procdump.exe.\n\nThe winlog task is \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\" which might relate to event log providers or engines. Not sure if that's directly relevant, but the fact that the same process is logged multiple times could be significant. If this is part of normal operations, maybe it's not a problem. But if it's an attacker checking for the presence of a tool, that's suspicious.\n\nAlso, the file field is \"None\" in all entries, which might mean that the file event wasn't captured, but the process events are being logged. Since the command is checking for a file that's not present (since they're exiting 1 if it's not there), maybe the attacker is trying to determine if procdump.exe is available for use. But without more context, like other events related to the actual execution of procdump.exe or other suspicious activities, it's a bit hard to tell.\n\nHowever, the fact that the same command is repeated multiple times could be part of a larger attack pattern. Maybe the attacker is checking for the presence of tools before proceeding with more malicious actions. The use of directory traversal in the path is a common technique in attacks to access files outside the intended directory. \n\nConsidering all that, while this alone might not be conclusive, the combination of repeated checks, the directory traversal, and the use of a tool like procdump.exe (which is often associated with malicious activities when used without proper context) makes this batch of events worth investigating further. So, I think the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated PowerShell commands check for the existence of procdump.exe using a directory traversal path (\\\"..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\\\"), which may indicate an attempt to locate or use a potentially malicious tool.
