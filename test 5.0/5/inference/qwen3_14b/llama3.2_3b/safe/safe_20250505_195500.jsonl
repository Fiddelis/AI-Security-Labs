All of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names that start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash.\n\nHmm, first thing I notice is that the same file is being created multiple times. For example, the file with hash 4dd86f6b38e03fc03eecefd5fa19f188.js appears twice. That might be a red flag. Also, the other files have different hashes, but the repetition of the same file could indicate an issue.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process associated with Microsoft Office, especially with the Office Deployment Tool. But typically, it's used for installing or updating Office. However, creating multiple JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages directory, which is usually for storing solution packages, might not be standard behavior. \n\nThe file names suggest they are minified JavaScript files, possibly part of an add-in or a web resource. However, the fact that they are being created in the OfflineFiles subdirectory, which is for offline use, might be normal. But the repetition and the number of files could be suspicious. \n\nI should check if creating multiple JavaScript files in that location is typical. If not, this could be an indicator of malicious activity, like a downloader or some form of payload. However, without more context, like other events or processes, it's hard to tell. \n\nBut considering the pattern here—multiple file creations by the same process in a specific directory with similar filenames—it's possible that this is part of a legitimate update or installation. However, the repetition of the same file might be an error or a sign of something else. \n\nAlternatively, the hashes in the filenames could be part of a legitimate versioning system. But the fact that the same file is created twice might not be an issue. However, the sheer number of files created could be unusual. \n\nI think the key points here are the repetition of the same file, the large number of files, and the location. Since the user is asking whether this batch is interesting, I need to weigh these factors. Without other suspicious events, it's a bit ambiguous. But given that all events are the same process creating files in a specific location, and considering that this might be a normal part of Office deployment, maybe it's not interesting. However, the repetition might still be a red flag. \n\nWait, but looking at the file paths again, they are all under the same package, which is 8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f. Maybe that's a specific package being deployed, and these files are part of it. However, the number of files seems high for a single package. \n\nAlternatively, this could be a legitimate process, and the events are just part of normal operations. But the fact that the same file is created twice might be an error. However, without more information, it's hard to say. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the classification here is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events are consistent with a legitimate process (SDXHelper.exe) performing normal operations, even though the repetition of files is unusual. However, without additional context or other suspicious activities, there's not enough evidence to classify this as interesting.

The files are all JavaScript files with names that start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office, right? It's used for managing add-ins or something like that. But creating so many JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles folder... Hmm. Normally, Office might download resources or packages, but creating multiple files with different hashes could be a red flag.\n\nWait, the file paths are all under the user's AppData directory, which is a common place for temporary or user-specific files. But the fact that the same file is being created multiple times (like the 70e3fb05... and 75e083f2... ones) might indicate something. Maybe it's a benign process, but the repetition and the number of files could be unusual.\n\nAlso, the names of the files include \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\", which might be related to a legitimate feature like the AI Copilot in Office. But the hashes at the end are different each time. If these are legitimate, they might be different versions or updates. However, the fact that they're all being created by SDXHelper.exe could be normal, but the volume here is quite high. There are 17 entries, each creating a different file. That's a lot for a single process in a short period.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided a timeframe. Are these all happening in a short span? If so, that's more suspicious. Also, the hashes might be unique identifiers for different resources, but if they're all being created by the same process, maybe there's an issue with the process being exploited to download malicious files disguised as legitimate resources.\n\nAnother angle: the file names are minified JavaScript files. Those are common in web applications, but in the context of Office, maybe they're part of an add-in or a new feature. However, the repetition and the number of files could indicate that the process is being used to inject malicious code under the guise of legitimate files. But without more context, like process parentage, user interactions, or network activity, it's hard to be certain.\n\nBut considering the classification task, the key is whether this is interesting for investigation. The presence of multiple files created by SDXHelper.exe in a user-specific directory with names that look like they could be part of a legitimate update or resource pack might be normal. However, the high number of files and the repetition could be a sign of something unusual, especially if this is not a typical behavior for SDXHelper.exe.\n\nAlternatively, if this is part of a legitimate update process, then it's not interesting. But since the user is asking for an analysis, and given that the files are all in the same directory with similar names, it's possible that this is a benign process. However, the system might be misconfigured, or the files could be part of a malicious payload.\n\nBut I'm not seeing any obvious signs of malicious activity here. The process is legitimate, the files are in a standard location, and the names don't immediately look like malware.

SDXHelper.exe – I'm not entirely sure what that is, but maybe it's related to some software deployment or package management. The fact that it's creating files in the Office SolutionPackages folder might be part of an update or installation process. However, the repetition of the same filenames being created multiple times could be a red flag. Wait, looking at the entries, some files are listed more than once. For example, the officeaicopilot-strings.min_3a4675727e552daf92a42dd9b4e7b99c.js appears twice. But maybe that's just the same file being created in different events, or maybe it's a mistake in the log. However, if the same file is being created multiple times by the same process, that might not be normal. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the path. The files are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory under SolutionPackages. If this is part of a legitimate Office update, maybe that's where they're stored. However, the presence of so many JavaScript files with different hashes in the filenames might indicate that they're being generated dynamically. But why would SDXHelper.exe be creating so many of them? Also, the names include hashes, which could be part of versioning, but again, it's hard to say without more context.\n\nI should also think about the possibility of this being malicious. If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, then this could be normal. However, if it's a malicious process, creating these files could be part of some payload or data exfiltration. But how common is it for legitimate processes to create so many files in that directory? Maybe the user is running some kind of Office add-in or extension that's being installed, which would explain the creation of these files. However, the fact that all the events are related to file creation without any other processes or network activity mentioned might be suspicious. \n\nWait, but the user only provided the file creation events. There's no information about other processes or network activity. So, without additional context, it's hard to determine if this is malicious. However, the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times could indicate that there's an issue.

If this is a known legitimate process, then it's probably okay. But if it's not, then this could be a sign of something malicious. Since I don't have information on whether SDXHelper.exe is legitimate, I have to rely on the context provided. The fact that all these files are being created in a specific directory by the same process could be part of a normal operation, but the volume of files and the repetition might be unusual. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the batch is interesting because it shows multiple file creations by the same process in a location that might not be typical for that process.

The file paths are all in the Office SolutionPackages directory, specifically under OfflineFiles. The filenames are all officeaicopilot-strings.min with different hashes. Hmm, that's a lot of file creations. But wait, there's also an event where a process is null and the task is Security Group Management. That might be a red herring, but maybe not. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, right? It's part of Microsoft's Office solution packages. But creating so many files, especially with different hash names, might be unusual. However, the fact that they're all in the expected directory under Office might be normal. But wait, the filenames are all minified JavaScript files. That's typical for web resources, but why so many? Maybe it's a normal update or installation. \n\nBut there's also the chrome.exe event loading BitsProxy.dll. That's a normal system DLL, so probably nothing wrong there. The repetition of the same file creation events might indicate that the process is creating multiple files, which could be part of a legitimate operation. However, the same file being created multiple times might be a sign of something else. Wait, looking at the paths, some of the files are duplicated.

However, the path here is within the Office SolutionPackages, which is a legitimate location. \n\nBut I should also consider the possibility that the user is trying to mimic normal behavior. The repetition of the same file creation might be a way to test if the system logs are being monitored. However, without more context, like other events or indicators of compromise, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the Security Group Management event has a process of null. That might be a system event, but it's not clear.

However, the confidence here is low because there's no clear malicious indicator. So maybe the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it's likely normal Office activity. But I need to check if there's any other red flags. \n\nWait, the Security Group Management event might be unrelated. But the rest are all about file creation.

First, I'll look through the JSON entries.\n\nMost of the events involve either chrome.exe or SDXHelper.exe. The tasks mentioned are Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, and File stream created. \n\nLooking at the files involved, several entries have paths in the Users directory under AppData for Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. These files are named officeaicopilot-strings.min with various hashes. That seems odd because those are JavaScript files, and having so many created in that directory might be suspicious. Office usually doesn't generate such files in that location, especially with those names. \n\nThen there's SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files. I should check if SDXHelper is a legitimate process. Wait, I recall that SDXHelper.exe is associated with malware, like the Agent Tesla or other info stealers. If that's the case, then multiple file creations in the Office directory could be part of a malicious activity. \n\nAlso, chrome.exe is involved in creating Zone.Identifier streams, which are usually created when files are downloaded from the internet. But there are multiple entries for the same file, which might indicate some kind of tampering or multiple operations on the same file. However, that's a normal part of how Windows handles downloaded files, so maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nThe registry events from chrome.exe might be normal, but without more context, it's hard to say.

Microsoft Office typically doesn't create so many JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages folder, especially with different language codes (like af-za, am-et, ar-sa, as-in). This could indicate that the SDXHelper.exe is being used to inject or deploy malicious scripts. The fact that multiple files are created in different language-specific directories might be an attempt to evade detection by mimicking legitimate Office resources.\n\nBut wait, could this be part of a legitimate Office update or installation?

From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the setup and deployment of solutions. It's involved in handling add-ins and other components. However, I should verify if this is a legitimate process or if it's sometimes abused by malware.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which is a known location for Office add-ins and packages. The files are named with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash. The hashes might be unique identifiers for different versions or components.

But since the user is asking about the entire batch, maybe there's something else. Then there are a few entries with process null and task None. Those might be just noise or incomplete logs. \n\nBut then I see a bunch of entries with SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific paths. The paths are under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages, and the files are JavaScript files. The names look like they could be localization files (like ca-es, cs-cz, da-dk, etc.), which might be part of a language pack or something similar. However, the fact that SDXHelper.exe is creating these files could be normal if it's part of Office's add-in or package management. But wait, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. Maybe it's related to some third-party add-in or a malicious component.\n\nAlso, looking at the file paths, they are in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. That's a known location for Office add-ins. However, the presence of multiple JavaScript files with different language codes might be part of a legitimate add-in, but the repetition of some files (like the ca-es ones) could be a red flag. Also, the fact that multiple files are created in different package directories might indicate an attempt to install or deploy something, possibly malicious.\n\nBut I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. If not, then creating these files could be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The registry events from EXCEL.EXE might be unrelated, but combined with the file creations, there's a possibility of something unusual happening. However, the confidence here is a bit low because it's possible that this is part of a legitimate Office add-in deployment. But the combination of registry changes and multiple file creations by a non-standard process could be worth investigating further. So, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory with localization-specific JS files, suggesting potential add-in deployment or malicious activity.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a new file in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and some hashes, like en-us-ui-strings-json_328d1c4fc74218eea9d206b5ac9fbc10.js. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior or something suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in handling solution packages, which might include language files or other resources. The fact that multiple files are being created in the OfflineFiles subdirectory could be part of an update or installation process.\n\nBut wait, the same process is creating multiple files with different language codes. That might be normal if the system is setting up multiple language packs. However, the repetition of some files, like es-es-ui-strings-json appearing twice, might be a red flag. Also, the presence of multiple language files could be a sign of a malicious payload trying to hide within legitimate-looking files. \n\nHowever, I should check if this is a known behavior. Office applications sometimes generate a lot of files during updates or when installing add-ins. The file paths are within the user's AppData directory, which is typical for user-specific data. The process is SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process. \n\nBut why so many files? Maybe the user is installing a multilingual version of Office, which would require multiple language packs. Alternatively, if these files are being created in a short period, it could be part of a malicious download. However, the logs don't show any errors or unusual process behavior. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. Since all the events are about file creation by a legitimate process in a standard directory, it's more likely benign. However, the sheer number of files and the repetition might warrant further investigation. But without additional context like other suspicious activities or known malware signatures, it's hard to classify this as malicious. \n\nSo, maybe the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activity aligns with normal Office operations. But I'm not entirely sure. The justification would be that the files are created by a legitimate process in a typical location, possibly during an update or language pack installation. The confidence is around 0.6, as there's some ambiguity but no clear malicious indicators.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show SDXHelper.exe creating language-specific UI string files in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, which aligns with normal Office update\/installation behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting or not. All the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific paths under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The files have names like ui-strings-json with various language codes and hashes.\n\nFirst, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, used for handling solution packages. So, if it's creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory, that might be normal. However, the presence of multiple files with similar names and hashes could be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. That's a standard location for Office add-ins or solutions. The filenames include language codes (like gl-es, he-il, etc.), which might indicate localization files. But why are there so many files being created? Are they part of a normal installation or update?\n\nWait, the same files are being created multiple times. For example, gl-es-ui-strings-json_0861ab052548d03508e72c866d11b0b7.js appears twice. That might be a sign of redundancy or maybe an error. However, if the process is legitimately creating these files as part of a package deployment, it's expected. \n\nBut I should also consider if the hashes are suspicious. The hashes in the filenames are long and unique, which is common for uniquely identifying files. However, if these files are not part of a known legitimate package, they could be malicious. But without more context, like the source of the package or any other suspicious activities (like network connections or registry changes), it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is the repetition. Multiple files being created with similar names and paths might indicate that the process is part of a larger deployment. However, if this is a one-time event during an installation, it's normal. But if this is happening frequently or in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it could be a problem.\n\nSince all events are related to file creation by a legitimate-sounding process in a legitimate directory, and there's no other evidence of malicious activity mentioned, it might not be interesting. However, the high number of files and repetition might warrant further investigation. \n\nBut the user wants a classification based on the entire batch. Given that SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process and the files are in a standard location, even though there are many files, it's possible that this is part of a normal Office operation. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence. However, if the system is not expecting such a large number of files or if there's a known issue with SDXHelper.exe, it could be interesting. Since there's no additional context, I'll lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with a confidence around 0.6, as there's some unusual activity but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate file creation by SDXHelper.exe (a known Microsoft Office process) in standard Office SolutionPackages directories.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and UI strings, like lt-lt-ui-strings-json, lv-lv, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. Office applications sometimes install language packs or resources, which might involve creating files in such directories. However, the repetition of some files, like ml-in-ui-strings-json appearing twice, could be a red flag. Also, the fact that all these files are created by the same process might indicate either a legitimate installation or a potential malicious activity.\n\nBut wait, the filenames seem to be related to UI strings for different languages. That does sound like part of a normal installation or update process, especially if the user is setting up Office with multiple language packs. However, the lack of other events (like process starts, network activity, etc.) makes it hard to confirm. \n\nOn the other hand, if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate Microsoft process, this could be normal. But if it's a malicious process masquerading as a legitimate one, creating multiple files in a user-specific directory might be suspicious. However, without additional context like process parentage, user interaction, or other anomalies, it's hard to be certain.\n\nConsidering the classification, since all events are similar and part of a structured directory, it's more likely a legitimate activity.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll scan through the entries to see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The file names look like they're language-specific UI string files, like ka-ge-ui-strings-json, kk-kz-ui-strings-json, etc. The paths are all under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages, which is a known location for Office add-ins or solutions. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. I remember that legitimate Office processes usually have names like EXCEL.EXE, WINWORD.EXE, etc. SDXHelper.exe might be part of a third-party add-in or a malicious component. However, creating multiple files with different language codes could be part of a legitimate localization process. But why are there so many files being created? That's a bit unusual. \n\nThen there are several entries where EXCEL.EXE is performing registry value sets. That's a red flag. Excel modifying the registry multiple times might indicate something malicious, like changing settings to persist or alter behavior. However, Excel can legitimately modify the registry for add-ins or configuration, but repeated registry changes without clear context are suspicious.\n\nLooking at the confidence factors: the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard directory, combined with multiple registry changes by Excel, could indicate a potential compromise. However, without more context like process parentage, user context, or network activity, it's hard to be certain. The justification for \"interesting\" would be the unusual activity patterns, but the confidence isn't extremely high because there's no direct evidence of malicious activity yet. Maybe the files are part of a legitimate update, but the combination of events is worth further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in Office SolutionPackages directory with language-specific UI string files, combined with repeated registry modifications by EXCEL.EXE, suggest potential malicious activity or unusual behavior warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
