Also, the same file names are appearing multiple times, which could indicate duplication or maybe some kind of injection.\n\nThen there's an event where the process is null and the task is \"Security Group Management\". That might not be directly related, but it's a bit odd. However, the other events are more concerning. The SDXHelper.exe process is creating a lot of JavaScript files with those minified names. Minified files can be normal, but if they're being created in large numbers and with unique hashes, it could be part of a malicious payload. Also, the hashes might be obfuscating the actual content. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the files are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory.

Maybe it's a benign activity, but the high number of events and the same process creating them all could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThere's also an event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory.

The repetition of the same files might indicate an attempt to inject malicious code or a data exfiltration. However, without more context, like the content of the files or other suspicious activities, it's a bit hard to be certain.

The files have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash-like strings. There are multiple entries for the same files, which might indicate that they're being created multiple times, but maybe that's part of a normal process.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, but sometimes malware can masquerade as legitimate processes. However, the fact that all these files are in the expected Office directory and have names that look like resource files might be normal. But I should check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nWait, there are also entries where svchost.exe and chrome.exe loaded BitsProxy.dll. BitsProxy.dll is a legitimate Windows system file, so those events might be normal. However, if there were multiple unusual DLLs being loaded, that could be a red flag. But in this case, it's just the standard one.\n\nNow, considering the repetition of the same files being created multiple times. Maybe the system is trying to create the same file repeatedly, which could indicate an issue. But maybe it's part of a package installation or update. However, the hash parts of the filenames are different each time, which might be normal for different versions or resources.\n\nAlternatively, if SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of files in the SolutionPackages directory, that could be part of a malicious activity, like downloading and executing payloads. But without more context, like network connections or other suspicious processes, it's hard to say. However, the fact that all the files are in the expected location and named similarly to legitimate resources might be benign.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the batch is interesting. Since all these events are related to the same process and same directory, and there's no other suspicious activity like network traffic or unexpected processes, maybe it's not interesting. However, the high number of file creations might still be worth investigating, especially if it's out of the norm for the user's environment.\n\nBut since the logs don't show any other anomalies, and the process is legitimate, I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING.\" However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files could be a sign of something.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what I need to do here. The user provided a bunch of JSON events and wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the events. All of them have the same process name: SDXHelper.exe. The winlog task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" each time. The files are all JavaScript files named similarly, located in the same directory under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The paths are all in the OfflineFiles subdirectory.\n\nHmm, so the same process is creating multiple JavaScript files in a specific location. Now, I need to think about what's normal and what's suspicious. SDXHelper.exe â€“ I'm not immediately familiar with this process. Maybe it's a legitimate part of Office, but the fact that it's creating so many files in the OfflineFiles directory might be unusual. Typically, Office might have some resources, but creating multiple JS files with different hashes in the same directory could indicate something like a malicious payload being dropped. However, without more context, like other processes or network activity, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, but looking at the filenames, they all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a hash. That might be part of a legitimate update or resource package. However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files might be normal if it's part of an installation or update. But if this is happening in a short time frame, it could be suspicious. However, the user hasn't provided timestamps, so I can't tell if they're all clustered together.\n\nAnother angle: the process SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft Office process. Maybe it's a third-party tool or a component from a different software. If this process is creating files in the Office directory, that might be a sign of something trying to inject or modify Office's resources. But again, without knowing what SDXHelper.exe is, it's hard to be certain.\n\nThe fact that all events are the same process creating similar files might not be enough on its own. However, the combination of the same process repeatedly creating files in a specific directory could be a red flag, especially if those files are not expected. Since the justification needs to be concise, I should consider whether this is unusual enough to warrant investigation.\n\nIn many cases, security tools flag unusual file creation, especially if the process isn't known or if the files are in unexpected locations. The Office directory is a common target for attackers, so creating multiple JS files there might be suspicious. However, if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, this could be normal. But since the user hasn't provided more context, the best approach is to flag it as interesting because the pattern is repetitive and the location is potentially sensitive.\n\nI think the confidence here is moderate. There's enough to be cautious but not definitive proof of malicious activity. So, the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7. The justification would be that the same process is creating multiple JavaScript files in a potentially sensitive directory, which could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical process entries creating JavaScript files in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, which may indicate suspicious resource injection or tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first thing I notice is that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files in a specific path under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The names of the files have a pattern with hashes and \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" in them.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe â€“ I'm not too familiar with that process, but I know that in some contexts, helper executables can be part of legitimate software. However, if this is creating a lot of files in a user's AppData folder, that might be suspicious. Office-related files in the SolutionPackages directory â€“ maybe part of an add-in or extension? But the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could indicate something else. Wait, looking at the paths, they're all in the same directory, and the same files are being created again and again. That might be normal if it's part of an installation or update process. But then there are also two events where chrome.exe is setting registry values. That might be normal too, but combined with the SDXHelper activity, maybe there's a connection.\n\nHowever, the key point here is that all the file creations are by SDXHelper.exe, and the files are JavaScript files. JavaScript in the context of Office might be part of a legitimate add-in, but if they're being created in the OfflineFiles directory, maybe they're being cached. However, the fact that there are multiple entries for the same files might suggest that they're being repeatedly created, which could be a sign of something trying to persist or install something. Alternatively, it could be a benign process that's just creating these files as part of its normal operation.\n\nAnother angle: the presence of multiple events with the same file paths might indicate a high volume of activity. But looking at the timestamps (though they're not provided here), if these events are all clustered in a short time, that could be a red flag. However, without timestamps, I can't say for sure. Also, the fact that the files are minified JavaScript could be normal for web-based add-ins, but again, depends on the context.\n\nThe other events with chrome.exe modifying the registry â€“ maybe part of a legitimate update or extension installation. But if combined with SDXHelper's activity, maybe there's a multi-stage attack. However, without more context, like the user's environment, whether these processes are known to be malicious, or if there are other indicators (like network connections, process injections, etc.), it's hard to tell. The logs provided don't include other details like process parents, user context, or network activity.\n\nSo, considering all this, the main red flags are the repeated creation of the same files by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard location, and the presence of JavaScript files in an Office-related directory. However, since the classification is based on the entire batch, and the events don't include clear signs of malicious behavior (like unexpected process names, unusual command-line arguments, or network connections to bad IPs), it might be a false positive or a legitimate process. But given that the files are created multiple times and the process is SDXHelper.exe, which isn't a well-known Microsoft process, I'm leaning towards this being interesting for further investigation.

SDXHelper.exe is a known process, but I should check if it's associated with any malicious activity. The files are being created in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. Office's SolutionPackages are part of add-ins or updates, so maybe this is related to a legitimate update or installation. However, the fact that multiple files are being created with similar names might indicate something. \n\nWait, the file names have hashes in them, like 70d9642ea5590d6f5310042ab74281ef.js. That looks like a SHA-1 hash. Sometimes, attackers use hashes in filenames to obfuscate or make it harder to track. But it could also be a legitimate naming convention. However, the repetition of the same filenames being created multiple times might be a red flag. Are these files being created multiple times by the same process? That could indicate a loop or a failed installation.\n\nAlso, the process SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office. If this is part of a legitimate Office update, then it's normal. But if the files are being created in a user's AppData directory, that's a common place for malicious software to hide.

I should check if there are any recent reports. If not, then maybe it's a false positive.

SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in handling solution packages, so creating files in that directory might be standard. But why so many files? There are duplicates here, like the same file being created multiple times. That's a bit suspicious. \n\nWait, the same file paths are repeated. For example, officeaicopilot-strings.min_8917b2e367df4d6b29481ec02636b8d3.js appears twice.

SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? Maybe it's related to some Office add-in or update. The fact that multiple files are being created in the OfflineFiles folder might be part of a legitimate process, like caching resources for an Office add-in. However, the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times could be a red flag. Why are the same files being created more than once? That might indicate a loop or an attempt to overwrite files, which could be malicious.\n\nAlso, looking at the paths, they're all in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office directory. That's a common place for Office to store temporary or cached files, so it's possible this is legitimate. But the presence of multiple identical file creations might be unusual. The other entry from chrome.exe creating a temporary file in Downloads is probably normal, like a download in progress.\n\nHowever, the main concern here is the repeated creation of the same JavaScript files. If this is part of a legitimate process, there might be a reason, but if it's an attack, maybe the attacker is trying to inject malicious code through these files. The file names include \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\", which sounds like it could be related to a legitimate Office AI Copilot feature, but I'm not sure if that's a real feature or if it's being spoofed here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the process name SDXHelper.exe. If this process is known to be malicious, then the activity would be suspicious. But if it's a legitimate process, then the file creations might be normal. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The fact that the same files are created multiple times might suggest that the process is not behaving as expected. Maybe the files are being created repeatedly due to an error or an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nI should also check if the hashes in the file names are random or if they follow a specific pattern.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a new file in the Office SolutionPackages directory.

SDXHelper.exe is a known process, right? It's related to Microsoft Office, specifically for handling add-ins or solutions. But creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory... Hmm. Normally, Office might install or update packages, but doing so repeatedly could be a red flag. However, the same file names are appearing multiple times. Wait, looking at the paths, they all have the same directory structure except for the hash part in the filename. Each file has a unique hash, but the same process is creating them. \n\nWait, but the same file is being created multiple times? Let me check. For example, the first entry is officeaicopilot-strings.min_62d7b64c92ca18af2e64b293ccc0f58b.js, then the next one is 657bdffe7496ffbb1c3d61c61660e632.js, and then again 657bdffe... So that same file is being created twice. Then another one, 6757e88a..., also twice. So there are duplicates here. That's odd. Why would the same file be created multiple times? Maybe the process is trying to overwrite or something, but the timestamps might be different. However, the logs don't show timestamps, just the file paths.\n\nAnother thing to note is the location. The files are in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. That's a legitimate place for Office to store solution packages, but if this is part of a legitimate update, there might be more context. However, the fact that the same process is creating multiple files with different hashes but in the same directory might indicate some kind of installation or update. But if this is a user's system, maybe they installed a new add-in or something. However, the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times could be a sign of something malicious. \n\nWait, but the hashes are different. Each file has a unique hash, which suggests they are different files. So maybe it's a legitimate update with multiple files. However, the process SDXHelper.exe is known to be used in Office for deploying solutions. But why so many files? Maybe it's part of a larger package. However, the fact that each entry is a separate FileCreate event might be normal.

If the user is installing a new Office add-in, this could be normal. But without more context, like other events or user activity, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that all these files are being created by SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process, might mean that this is not malicious. But the high number of files and the repetition might be suspicious. \n\nWait, but looking at the hash values, they all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a long hash. That seems like a naming convention for localized resource files. So maybe this is part of a legitimate Office update or installation of a new feature, like the AI Copilot in Office 365. If that's the case, then these files are just part of the package resources. However, the same file being created multiple times might not be normal. Unless the logs are capturing multiple events for the same file creation, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, if the process is creating multiple files with different hashes, maybe it's part of a legitimate package installation. But the repetition of the same file names (like the 657bdffe one) being logged twice might be a duplicate event.

I'd lean towards interesting but with moderate confidence since it's a single suspicious event among mostly normal ones.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Chrome.exe loading a DLL from Windows Defender's directory (MpClient.dll) is unusual and could indicate a compromised process.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. All the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of a package or update. The paths are all under the user's AppData, which is a common place for temporary files or application data.\n\nFirst, I need to check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. Microsoft Office does use some helper processes, but I should verify if SDXHelper.exe is part of the official Office suite. If it's a legitimate process, then creating these files might be normal, especially if they're part of an update or resource package. However, if SDXHelper.exe isn't a known legitimate process, this could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the file names, they all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash. The hashes look like they could be checksums or unique identifiers for different versions of the file. The repetition of the same files being created multiple times might indicate that the process is writing the same files over and over, which could be normal if it's part of an installation or update process. However, repeated creation of the same files might also be a sign of something trying to persist or overwrite files, which is suspicious.\n\nThe directory path is under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. If this is a legitimate Office update, then maybe these files are part of the package resources. However, the presence of multiple JavaScript files with similar names might be part of a larger package. But I should consider if there's any indication of malicious activity, like unexpected file creation in a non-standard location, or if the process is known to be malicious.\n\nAnother point is that all the events are from the same process, SDXHelper.exe, and all are file creation events. If this process is known to be part of Office, then it's probably legitimate. However, if there's no information on SDXHelper.exe being a legitimate process, this could be a red flag. Also, the fact that multiple files are created in a short period might be indicative of a larger operation, such as installing a malicious payload or exfiltrating data.\n\nBut since there's no other information in the logs, like network activity, process execution, or user interaction, it's hard to tell. The logs only show file creation. So, the key factors here are the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe and the normalcy of the file creation in that directory. If SDXHelper.exe is legitimate and the files are part of an Office update, then this isn't interesting. If not, then it's suspicious.\n\nI need to check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. A quick search in my mind: Microsoft Office does have some helper processes, but SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard one. It might be part of a third-party application or a malicious tool. The file names with \"officeaicopilot\" suggest it might be related to the AI Copilot feature in Office, but I'm not sure if that's a real component. If it's a new feature, maybe these files are part of it. However, without more context, it's hard to confirm.\n\nConsidering the lack of other events and the repetitive nature of the file creations, I would lean towards this being suspicious. The confidence isn't extremely high because there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the combination of an unusual process name and repeated file creation in a non-standard location raises some flags.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard Office directory path, with filenames containing hashes and 'officeaicopilot' strings, suggesting potential malicious resource injection or tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with long, unique hashes in their names. That's a bit odd because normally, Office might have some resources, but creating so many JS files with those hashes could be a red flag. Also, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. I remember that some malware uses similar names to mimic legitimate processes. \n\nThen there's chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a normal system file, so that might not be suspicious. The winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directoryâ€”could be part of an installation or configuration, but not necessarily malicious. The EXCEL.EXE process opening a spreadsheet and loading combase.dll, another standard DLL, so that's probably normal user activity.\n\nBut going back to the SDXHelper.exe events. The fact that it's creating multiple files in the Office directory with those specific paths and filenames is concerning. The hashes in the filenames might be obfuscation techniques used by malware to avoid detection. Also, the repetition of the same filenames being created multiple times might indicate some kind of deployment or injection process. \n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. From what I recall, Microsoft Office doesn't have a process called SDXHelper.exe. It might be a typo or a malicious process masquerading as something else. The files being created are JavaScript files, which could be part of a malicious payload, especially if they're being injected into the Office environment. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. There are multiple events, but they might be part of a legitimate software update or installation. However, the combination of the unusual process name, the location of the files, and the repeated creation of files with unique hashes makes me lean towards \"INTERESTING.\" The justification would be the suspicious process name and the unusual file creation patterns in a non-standard directory. I'd say confidence around 0.7 because while it's not a smoking gun, the indicators are enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files with obfuscated JavaScript filenames are created by SDXHelper.exe in non-standard Office directories, which is unusual for legitimate processes.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a process called HxTsr.exe with a registry value set. That might be suspicious, but I need to check more. Then there are multiple entries for SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are named with language codes and have .js extensions. That seems odd because Office typically doesn't create JavaScript files in those directories. Also, the same file paths are repeated multiple times, which might indicate some kind of loop or repeated action.\n\nThen there are events related to EXCEL.EXE creating file streams and loading DLLs. The Zone.Identifier streams are normal for marking files as coming from the internet, but the other DLLs loaded are part of Microsoft Office, so that's probably legitimate. However, the repeated creation of JavaScript files by SDXHelper.exe is still a red flag. \n\nSDXHelper.exe is a known Microsoft Office process, but creating so many JS files in the OfflineFiles directory doesn't seem right. Maybe this is part of a malicious activity where the process is being used to inject or store malicious code. The HxTsr.exe process might be related to this, as it's modifying the registry, which could be part of persistence or configuration changes.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit moderate. While the events aren't obviously malicious, the unusual file creation patterns and the registry change warrant further investigation. I should classify this as INTERESTING but with a confidence around 0.6 because there's enough suspicious activity to merit looking into it more, even though it's not a clear-cut attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple SDXHelper.exe processes creating numerous JavaScript files in Microsoft Office's OfflineFiles directory, which is unusual for legitimate Office operations.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipper, so it might be setting up configuration files. The file path is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a temporary config file. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames are things like fabric_...js and bn-in-ui-strings-json...js. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in handling add-ins or solutions. So creating these JS files might be part of normal Office operations, like installing or updating add-ins. But why are there so many repeated entries? Wait, looking at the paths, the same files are being created multiple times. That's odd. Maybe a loop or a failure in the process? But maybe it's just multiple events from different operations. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's Explorer.EXE setting registry values. That's common for user actions, like changing settings or shortcuts. The EXCEL.EXE entries are creating a .LNK file in the Recent folder. That's normal when you open a file in Excel; it creates a shortcut in the Recent directory. But there are multiple EXCEL.EXE events with Registry value sets. Maybe the user was interacting with Excel a lot, but that's not necessarily malicious.\n\nNow, considering the combination. The majority of events are from legitimate processes: winlogbeat, SDXHelper, Explorer, Excel. The files created by SDXHelper are in expected locations for Office add-ins. The repeated entries might be due to multiple operations or logging issues, but not necessarily malicious. The only thing that stands out is the .yml.new file, but that's part of winlogbeat's normal operation. No signs of unusual processes, unexpected file types, or access to sensitive areas. Also, no network activity or other suspicious behavior mentioned. So overall, these events seem to be part of normal user and application activities. Maybe the confidence is low, but not enough to flag as interesting. So classification would be NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve standard processes (winlogbeat, SDXHelper, Excel, Explorer) performing typical operations (file creation, registry updates) in expected locations (Office directories, Downloads, Recent files).

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path looks like part of Microsoft Office's temporary files, so maybe it's legitimate. But creating files there might not be a big red flag yet.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for EXCEL.EXE loading system DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. These are standard system files, so loading them is normal. But I notice that some of these DLLs are part of .NET and Windows components, which Excel might use. Still, nothing suspicious here.\n\nHowever, looking at the file paths, one of the created files is a JavaScript file named word_88b086261de1446381728f2f003dad876baa5ace5feab65b3fba352ef7fab4c6.js. The long, random-looking filename might be a sign of something generated by malware, though it could also be a legitimate Office-generated file. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen there's an event where EXCEL.EXE creates a file in the Downloads directory named ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. The tilde and dollar sign in the filename suggest it's a temporary file created by Excel when editing a document. That seems normal. But then the same file is deleted, which is also typical for temporary files. So maybe that's just Excel's normal operation.\n\nThe svchost.exe processes are setting registry values multiple times. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and registry changes can be normal. But multiple registry events might be worth checking if they're related to malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thing to note is that SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory twice. The filenames are long and have hashes in them. That might be part of a legitimate process, but sometimes malware uses similar patterns. However, SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, so maybe it's just part of Office's operations.\n\nLooking at the Pipe Created event for EXCEL.EXE, that's usually for inter-process communication and isn't necessarily malicious. The Registry value set events from EXCEL.EXE might be part of its normal functioning, but again, need to check if they're unusual.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: most of them are normal system and application activities. The only potential flags are the JavaScript files created by SDXHelper.exe and the repeated registry changes. However, without more context or additional suspicious events (like network activity, unexpected processes, or unusual command-line arguments), it's hard to confirm malicious intent.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the classification should be based on the entire batch. The presence of multiple file creations in Office directories, along with registry changes, might be part of a larger attack. However, the events don't show clear signs of exploitation or lateral movement. The JavaScript files could be part of a malicious payload, but without more data, it's speculative.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity beyond possibly the JavaScript files, which could be legitimate, I'd lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence. However, if the system's baseline is that SDXHelper.exe creating such files is unusual, then it might be interesting.

Then, towards the end, there are two entries involving \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating a file in the Office SolutionPackages directory.\n\nHmm. The repeated registry changes by Excel might be normal, but maybe not. Excel sometimes interacts with the registry, but if it's doing it a lot, that could be suspicious. However, the majority of the logs are just Excel setting registry values. But then there's that SDXHelper.exe creating a JavaScript file in a specific path. Office's SolutionPackages directory is used for add-ins or solutions, so creating files there might be part of normal operations, but the name of the file is a bit generic. However, the fact that it's being created by SDXHelper.exe, which I think is related to Office solutions, might be normal.

The file paths are all in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory, which might be part of some add-in or extension. The names of the files include things like office_strings, taskpane, and various language-specific UI strings. There's also some repetition hereâ€”same files being created multiple times. \n\nThen there are a few DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE. But the main thing here is the SDXHelper.exe activity. Now, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, particularly for handling add-ins. However, the fact that it's creating a lot of JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory could be a red flag. Normally, these files might be part of a legitimate add-in, but the repetition and the specific naming might indicate something else. \n\nWait, but the same files being created multiple times might just be part of the normal operation if the add-in is being installed or updated. However, the presence of multiple different files with varying names and hashes (even though the hashes aren't provided here) might be suspicious. Also, the path includes \"SolutionPackages\" which is a known place for add-ins, but if these are not expected by the user, it could be a sign of a malicious add-in.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the user hasn't mentioned any other suspicious activity, like network connections to unknown IPs or unusual process behavior. The DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE might be normal if the user is accessing external resources, but without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nBut the main point here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe. If these files are part of a legitimate add-in, then it's not a problem. However, if the add-in is malicious, then those files could be part of the payload. Since the user is asking whether the batch is interesting, and given that the files are being created in a location associated with Office add-ins, this might be a legitimate process. However, the repetition and the number of files could indicate an anomaly. \n\nBut wait, looking again, the same file paths are repeated. For example, the first two entries are identical. That might be a log duplication or a real event. If the same file is created multiple times, that's unusual. Also, the different package IDs (like f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2 and 36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b) might be from different add-ins.

But if there's no user action or if the add-ins are unknown, that's suspicious. Since the logs don't provide info on user actions or the origin of the add-ins, the system might flag this as interesting. \n\nSo, considering that SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but the volume and repetition of file creations might indicate an unusual activity.

The hashes might be unique identifiers for each package version. If the same hash is repeated, that's normal. But if there are a lot of unique hashes, maybe that's more suspicious.

Maybe it's a legitimate file, but the repetition of the same event twice makes me wonder if there's something off here. But two instances might just be normal, like a setup process.\n\nAfter that, there's a bunch of entriesâ€”23 of themâ€”all showing EXCEL.EXE setting registry values. That's a lot. Normally, Excel might modify the registry for its own operations, but 23 times? That seems excessive. Maybe it's part of a macro or some automated process, but could also be a sign of something malicious. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being changed or other processes involved, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe classification depends on whether these events are abnormal. The SDXHelper.exe creating a file might be normal, but the repeated registry changes by Excel could be a red flag. However, since the user hasn't provided any other context, like known malicious activity or other indicators, it's a bit tricky. \n\nI think the key here is the high number of registry events. Even if they are legitimate, such a high frequency might warrant further investigation.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, all showing files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific paths under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The first thing I notice is that the same files are being created multiple times. For example, the hr-hr-ui-strings-json file is logged twice, same with others. That might just be duplicate entries, but maybe there's something else going on.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe â€“ I'm not immediately familiar with that process. It's not a standard Windows process, but maybe it's part of some Office add-in or a third-party application. The fact that it's creating files in the SolutionPackages folder, which is part of Microsoft Office's local storage, could be normal if it's part of a legitimate package deployment. However, the repetition of the same files might indicate that the process is being used to repeatedly create the same files, which could be a sign of something malicious, like trying to overwrite or inject code.\n\nLooking at the file names, they all end with .js, which are JavaScript files. These could be legitimate resources, but if they're being created in a location that's not typical for user-generated files, that's a red flag. Also, the paths include hashes in the filenames, like 47403e608f496138f88d554c77fa98b0.js. Hashes in filenames are sometimes used to obfuscate the real content, making it harder to detect what the file is doing. That's a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of the same events. If the same file is being created multiple times, maybe the process is trying to ensure that the file is present, or it's part of a larger attack where multiple files are being deployed. However, without more context, like other events (e.g., network activity, registry changes, or process injections), it's hard to say for sure. But the fact that all these files are being created by the same process in a specific directory that's part of Office's local storage could be suspicious.\n\nI should also consider if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. If it's not, then this is a strong indicator of malicious activity. However, if it's a legitimate process, then maybe these file creations are part of normal operations. But given the lack of information about SDXHelper.exe and the suspicious file naming and repetition, I'm leaning towards this being interesting for investigation.

The files are named with language codes and have .js extensions. They're all in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. The same file paths are repeated multiple times, which might indicate that the process is creating these files multiple times, maybe as part of a normal installation or update process.\n\nThen there are some events from EXCEL.EXE and svchost.exe related to DNS queries and registry changes. But those seem more like normal system activities. However, the repeated creation of files by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory raises a flag. \n\nWait, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, right? It's used for various tasks, including handling add-ins or solutions. But creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles folder might be part of a package deployment. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could be a sign of something unusual. Maybe the process is being used to inject malicious code, but the file names don't look suspicious. They seem to be language-specific UI strings, which might be part of a legitimate localization process.\n\nBut why are the same files being created multiple times? That's a bit odd. Normally, during an installation, files are created once. Repeated creation might indicate a loop or a malicious attempt to overwrite or inject content. However, without more context, like the content of the files or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple events from SDXHelper.exe could be normal if it's part of a package installation that's being processed multiple times.\n\nThe other events from EXCEL.EXE and svchost.exe don't seem directly related to the file creation events. They're more about DNS queries and registry changes, which are common activities. Unless there's a connection between those events and the file creations, but I don't see it here.\n\nThe last event has process null and task \"None\", which might be an error or a placeholder. Not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nConsidering all this, the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory might be worth investigating, but since SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, it might not be malicious.

So first, I'll look through the events.\n\nMost of the entries are about EXCEL.EXE performing registry value sets. There are seven of those. Then, there are several entries about SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific paths under the user's AppData directory. The files have names like kok-in-ui-strings-json and others with different language codes, and some are transcription-strings.min.js.\n\nHmm. The registry changes by Excel might be normal, but maybe not. However, the files created by SDXHelper.exe are in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path seems related to Microsoft Office, so maybe these are legitimate files part of an add-in or update. But why so many files being created? Also, the filenames include language codes and \"ui-strings-json,\" which might be part of localization files. However, the presence of multiple files with similar names could indicate some kind of deployment or installation activity.\n\nWait, but SDXHelper.exe is a process associated with Microsoft Office, right? It's used for handling add-ins or solutions. So creating files in the SolutionPackages directory might be normal during the installation or update of an add-in. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be a red flag. Also, the fact that there are both registry changes and file creations could indicate some automated process, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nBut then again, if these files are part of a legitimate Office add-in, then it's normal. However, if the files are being created in a way that's not typical, or if the process is not supposed to be creating these files, that could be suspicious. Since the user is asking for investigation, maybe the combination of multiple registry changes and file creations by different processes could be part of a larger activity that's not benign.\n\nAlternatively, if these are all part of a legitimate Office update or add-in deployment, then it's not interesting. But without more context, like the user's environment or if there are other indicators of compromise, it's hard to tell. However, the presence of multiple file creations with specific naming patterns and the involvement of both Excel and SDXHelper.exe might be worth investigating further.

The file names look like they might be localization files (like mi-nz, mk-mk, ml-in, etc.), which are language-specific. But why so many of them? Also, the same file paths are repeated multiple times. That's a bit suspicious. Normally, you wouldn't have the same file created multiple times unless there's some kind of loop or error.\n\nThen there's one event where EXCEL.EXE is setting a registry value. That's a different process. But is that related? Maybe not directly, but combined with the other events, it might be part of a larger activity. However, the main focus here is the repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe.\n\nSDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. It's possible that it's part of some software, but if it's creating a lot of files in the Office SolutionPackages folder, that might be unusual. Office typically doesn't generate such files in that location. Also, the naming pattern of the files suggests they might be part of an add-in or some kind of package, but the repetition could indicate an attempt to inject malicious code or data.\n\nHowever, without more context, like other events indicating malicious behavior (like network connections, process injections, or other suspicious registry changes), it's hard to be certain. The presence of multiple file creations could be benign if, for example, a user is installing a new Office add-in that requires many localization files. But the repetition of the same files might still be a red flag.\n\nOn the other hand, if this is part of a legitimate software deployment, maybe during an update or installation, then it might not be malicious. But the lack of other events pointing to malicious activity makes me think this might be a false positive or just a normal process. However, the fact that the same file is created multiple times is concerning.\n\nSo, considering all this, the batch might be interesting because of the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard location, which could indicate an anomaly.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, there are three JSON entries here, each describing a file creation event by the process SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files located in the OfflineFiles directory under a specific Office SolutionPackages folder.\n\nFirst, I need to check if these files are legitimate. The process name is SDXHelper.exe. I'm not immediately familiar with this process, but I should consider if it's a known legitimate one. Microsoft Office might have helper processes, but I'm not sure about SDXHelper specifically. Maybe it's part of some add-in or solution package?\n\nNext, looking at the file paths. They're all in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. That seems like a place where Office might store solution packages or add-ins. The filenames are ui-strings-json with different language codes (nb-no and ne-np). These look like localization files for user interface strings. If this is part of a legitimate Office add-in or package, then the creation of these files might be normal.\n\nHowever, the same process creating multiple files in a short time could be suspicious. But the user hasn't provided timestamps, so I don't know if they're created sequentially or spread out. Also, the filenames have unique hashes in the names, which might be part of versioning or unique identifiers for the package.\n\nI should also consider if SDXHelper.exe is a known malicious process. A quick recall (without looking up) â€“ I don't remember any major malware using that exact name. However, the name could be spoofed. The fact that the files are in a temporary or user-specific directory (AppData) might be normal for some installations.\n\nAnother angle: the events are all FileCreate rules. If the system's SIEM or log source is generating these alerts, maybe the rule is triggered by certain conditions. But the user hasn't provided the rule details. The fact that three files are created by the same process in the same directory might be part of a legitimate installation or update process.\n\nBut wait, why three entries? The second and third events have the same file path. Maybe it's a duplicate event or a mistake in logging. Or perhaps the process created the same file twice. That could be an error, but maybe part of a normal operation, like a retry or overwrite.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the events might be part of a legitimate Office solution package installation. However, without more context, like the process's digital signature, the presence of other suspicious events, or the user's environment, it's hard to be certain. The classification here is tricky. Since the events don't show obvious signs of malicious activity (like access to sensitive files, network connections, or unusual process behavior), but also don't confirm legitimacy, maybe it's not immediately interesting. However, the repetition of the same file might be a red flag.
