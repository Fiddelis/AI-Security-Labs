{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deploying and managing Windows images. The winlog task is \"File Executable Detected\" with the rule FileExecutableDetected. Each event has a file path in the user's Temp directory, specifically under a unique GUID folder: 33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89. The files are all .mui files, which are language resource files for Windows.\n\nNow, why would this be suspicious? Well, Dism.exe is a legitimate process, but the fact that it's detecting multiple executable files in the Temp directory might be unusual. However, looking at the file extensions, they're all .mui, which are not executable files. The rule FileExecutableDetected might be triggering because the system is flagging these .mui files as executable, which could be a false positive. Alternatively, if these files were actually malicious, they might be trying to disguise themselves as language resources. But given that they're in the Temp directory and associated with Dism.exe, which is part of Windows Setup, this might be part of a legitimate process, like a Windows Update or image deployment. \n\nHowever, the high number of events (15) all pointing to the same GUID folder might indicate that something is generating a lot of files there. But since all the files are .mui and the process is Dism.exe, which is trusted, it's possible that this is just a normal operation. On the other hand, if the system is detecting these as executable, maybe there's a misconfiguration in the detection rule. \n\nBut the key point here is that the files are in the Temp directory, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files. However, since the process is Dism.exe, which is legitimate, and the files are .mui, which are not typically executable, this might not be a security threat. However, the fact that the rule is triggering multiple times might still be worth investigating to ensure that there's no false positive or actual malicious activity. \n\nSo, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" because there's a high volume of events related to Dism.exe detecting multiple files in the Temp directory, which could be part of a legitimate process but also might indicate something unusual.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines representing system logs. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each event and see what's happening. The main process here is powershell.exe, which is common but can be a red flag if it's doing suspicious things. Let me check the tasks and files involved.\n\nLooking at the first few entries: there's a Pipe Created event, Image loaded for clrjit.dll and MpClient.dll. Those are .NET and Windows Defender DLLs. Loading them might be normal, but I should check if there's anything unusual. Then there's a Process accessed event, which isn't too bad on its own.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate command to get user info. But the command line for powershell.exe later on is a bit long. Let me check that one. The command is using Get-Item on inf files and checking for defaultinstall sections. That might be looking for installation scripts, which could be part of a setup or maybe something malicious. The execution policy is set to Restricted, which is the default, so that might be normal, but the script is scanning INF files for specific patterns. Not sure yet if that's bad.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for various .NET and Windows Defender DLLs. Those are legitimate, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, it might be a problem. Also, there's a File created event in the Temp directory with a .psm1 file. That's a PowerShell module file. Creating such a file in Temp could be part of a script being executed, which might be normal, but sometimes attackers use Temp for malicious scripts.\n\nAnother File created event is in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a PowerShell startup profile, which could be used to run scripts automatically. If that's being modified, it might be a sign of persistence.\n\nThe command line for one of the powershell.exe processes includes a script that's checking INF files for defaultinstall sections. INF files are used for installing drivers and other software. The script is looking for sections that might indicate a default install for different architectures. This could be part of a legitimate process, like checking for compatible installations, but it could also be part of a malicious process trying to find installation points to exploit.\n\nAlso, the fact that multiple ImageLoad events are happening for various DLLs, including those from .NET and Windows Defender, might be normal if the PowerShell process is running a legitimate application. However, the combination with the file creation in Temp and the StartupProfileData, along with the script scanning INF files, might indicate something more suspicious.\n\nThe presence of the whoami.exe process is normal, but if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, that might be a red flag. However, by itself, it's not enough.\n\nPutting it all together: the main indicators here are the creation of files in Temp and StartupProfileData, the scanning of INF files, and the loading of multiple DLLs. These could be part of a legitimate process, but the combination might suggest that someone is trying to modify system configurations or set up persistence. The script's purpose isn't immediately clear, but the fact that it's searching for defaultinstall sections could be part of a larger attack vector, like trying to find ways to install malicious software or modify system settings.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. Since the events include some suspicious file creations and a script that's checking for INF files, but there's no direct evidence of malicious activity (like connecting to a C2 server, downloading files, etc.), the confidence might be moderate. It's not a clear-cut case of malware, but there are enough indicators that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving PowerShell: file creation in system directories, scanning INF files for installation patterns, and loading of Windows Defender and .NET DLLs, which may indicate reconnaissance or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, all the events are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for image deployment and management. Each entry has a winlog task indicating \"File Executable Detected\" under the rule FileExecutableDetected. The files in question are all DLLs located in the Temp directory under a specific GUID folder.\n\nHmm, the fact that multiple DLLs are being detected by Dism.exe might be normal if they're part of a legitimate system process, like during a system image deployment or servicing. However, the presence of multiple executable files in the Temp directory could also be a red flag. Typically, the Temp folder is used for temporary files, but if these DLLs are being executed or loaded by Dism.exe, that might be unusual.\n\nWait, but Dism.exe is known to use various providers and components during its operations. The names of the DLLs like SysprepProvider.dll, TransmogProvider.dll, etc., might be part of the standard Dism components. However, I should check if these specific DLLs are known to be part of legitimate Dism operations. If they are, then this might be normal. But if not, it could indicate malicious activity.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the path. The Temp directory is a common place for malware to drop files, but if Dism is legitimately using these files, then it's okay. However, the fact that all these files are detected as executable by the rule might suggest that the system's detection mechanism is flagging them as executable, which could be normal for DLLs that are being loaded as part of the process.\n\nWait, but DLLs are not typically executable files. They are dynamic link libraries. However, some security tools might classify them as executable if they are being run or injected. But in this case, the rule is FileExecutableDetected, which might be triggered when a file is executed. If these DLLs are being executed rather than loaded, that could be suspicious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the detection rule is too broad, and it's flagging any file that is being accessed by a process, even if it's a DLL. That could lead to false positives. However, given that all these files are in the Temp directory and are being accessed by Dism.exe, which is a legitimate process, it might not be a threat. But I need to be cautious here.\n\nAnother angle: the GUID in the path (33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89) might be a temporary folder created by Dism during an operation. If that's the case, then the presence of these DLLs is part of a legitimate process. However, if the GUID is unusual or if there's a lack of other logs indicating a system deployment, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nI should also check if there are any other events related to these files, like process creation, network activity, or registry changes. But in the given logs, there's only the File Executable Detected events. Without more context, it's hard to say. But considering that all the events are from Dism.exe and the files are in the Temp directory, which is common for temporary files during deployments, it might be a legitimate activity.\n\nHowever, the classification of these files as executable by the rule might be a false positive. But since the user is asking whether the batch is relevant for investigation, I need to determine if there's enough suspicious activity here. The fact that multiple files are being detected as executable by the same process in the Temp directory could be worth investigating further, even if it's a false positive. But given that Dism.exe is a legitimate tool, maybe it's not a threat.\n\nWait, but the rule is called FileExecutableDetected. If the system's detection is based on file extensions or other criteria, maybe these DLLs are not supposed to be executable. Alternatively, maybe the detection is correct, and these are indeed executable files being used in a way that's not typical for Dism. But I'm not sure.\n\nIn conclusion, while the logs show multiple files being detected as executable by Dism.exe in the Temp directory, the presence of these files could be part of a legitimate system process. However, the repetition and the location in Temp might warrant further investigation.

Alright, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple entries involve the process 'Dism.exe' and 'DismHost.exe'. Dism is a known Windows tool used for deployment and imaging, so that's normal in some contexts. But then there are a bunch of files being detected as executable, all in the Temp directory. The filenames are things like SetupPlatformProvider.dll, SmiProvider.dll, etc. These are all .dll files, which are dynamic link libraries. Normally, .dll files are part of legitimate software, but they can also be used by malware to inject code.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're all in the AppData\\Local\\Temp folder, which is a common place for temporary files. However, the presence of multiple .dll files being loaded by DismHost.exe might be suspicious. The fact that they're all in the same temporary directory and loaded by a process that's typically associated with Windows deployment tools could indicate something's off. Legitimate Dism usage usually doesn't involve loading so many dlls from Temp, especially with names that seem generic or possibly obfuscated.\n\nAlso, there's a DismHost.exe process created with a command line that includes a GUID. That might be normal, but combined with the multiple image loads of these dlls, it could be part of a larger operation. The rule names in the winlog entries are 'FileExecutableDetected' and 'ImageLoad', which are part of security monitoring. The fact that these events are triggered might mean that the system's security software is flagging these activities as potentially malicious.\n\nNow, I should consider if this is a false positive. Dism and DismHost are legitimate, but the context here is the loading of multiple dlls from Temp. In a normal scenario, maybe during an installation or deployment, but if this is happening without user interaction or in a non-standard environment, it could be a sign of compromise. However, without more context, like the system's state or other logs, it's hard to tell.

It's used for things like Windows Imaging, so loading a bunch of providers might be normal during deployment tasks. But the fact that so many DLLs are being loaded from the Temp folder could be a red flag. Typically, legitimate software doesn't load that many DLLs from temporary directories, especially if they're all different names. That might indicate something malicious trying to inject code or perform actions under the guise of legitimate processes.\n\nWait, but there's also the deletion events. The Dism.exe process is deleting some of these DLLs. Maybe that's part of a normal cleanup? But why would they delete them if they were just loaded?

The command lines seem benign, like writing 'Final result: 1' or checking INF files for certain patterns. But why are there so many repeated commands? Maybe the user is testing something, but maybe it's a script being executed multiple times.\n\nWait, the command that checks INF files for defaultinstall sections might be looking for drivers or installation scripts.

The first set of entries (the first six) have a command line that's scanning INF files in the Windows directory. The PowerShell script is checking for specific patterns in those INF files, looking for sections like [defaultinstall.nt...]. The second set of entries (the next seven) involve removing a zip file named *entrada_principal.zip from the Temp directory.\n\nLooking at the first type of command: scanning INF files. INF files are typically used for installing drivers or other system components. The script is checking for sections that might be related to different architectures (amd64, arm, etc.). This could be part of a legitimate process, like checking for driver installations. However, it's also possible that this is part of a malicious activity, such as checking for existing drivers to replace them or to gather information about the system's configuration. The fact that the same command is repeated multiple times might indicate that it's part of a larger process, maybe a script that's being run multiple times, which could be suspicious.\n\nThe second type of command is deleting a zip file from the Temp directory. Deleting temporary files is a common activity, but the specific filename *entrada_principal.zip might be noteworthy. The asterisk suggests a wildcard, so it's removing all zip files that match that pattern. This could be part of cleaning up after an installation or extraction process. However, if this is done without proper context, it might be an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activity, like a downloaded payload or a tool used in an attack.\n\nNow, looking at the combination of these two activities. The first part is scanning INF files, which might be checking for system configurations, and the second part is deleting a zip file. If these are part of a legitimate application's installation or update process, it might be normal. However, the combination of scanning system files and then deleting a zip file could be suspicious. For example, an attacker might scan the system to find vulnerabilities or existing configurations that can be exploited, then delete evidence of their presence by removing a zip file they used to deploy malware.\n\nAdditionally, the repetition of the same commands in multiple events might indicate that the process is being run multiple times, which could be a sign of persistence or a script that's looping. However, without more context, like the user initiating the process or the presence of other suspicious activities, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe winlog task fields vary between 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', but I'm not entirely sure what those tasks mean in the context of Windows logs. It might be related to the event log provider or engine, but without more information, it's hard to tell if that's relevant.\n\nConsidering all this, the presence of both scanning system files and deleting a zip file might be a red flag. However, since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity (like downloading files, executing payloads, or modifying system settings), it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence level would be moderate, as there's enough to warrant further investigation but not enough to confirm malicious intent definitively.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands scanning INF files for architecture-specific sections and deleting a zip file from Temp, which could indicate system enumeration or cleanup post-exploitation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this data. It seems to be a series of log entries, possibly from Windows Security Event Logs. Each entry has a process name, a winlog task, and sometimes a file path. The user might be trying to analyze these logs for security purposes, maybe looking for suspicious activities.\n\nFirst, I notice that 'powershell.exe' is involved in several events. There's a process create event where the command line includes removing a file named *entrada_principal.zip from the Temp directory. That's a red flag because deleting files, especially from Temp, could be part of cleaning up after an attack. Also, the use of PowerShell with the Remove-Item command might be used to delete evidence.\n\nThen, there are multiple ImageLoaded events for various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET Framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and System.Management.Automation.ni.dll. Those are normal for PowerShell operations. However, the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might indicate that the process is interacting with the antivirus, which could be a legitimate activity or a way to bypass it.\n\nLooking at the FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events, there's a file created in the Temp directory and then immediately deleted. This could be part of a script that's executing and then removing its temporary files. The fact that the file is named with a random string (rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1) suggests it's a generated script, possibly malicious.\n\nThe user might be concerned about whether these activities are benign or malicious. The PowerShell commands are standard for scripting, but the deletion of the zip file and the creation of a temporary script might be part of an attack. Also, the involvement of Windows Defender's DLL could be a sign that the system is detecting something, but it's not clear if it's a false positive or an actual threat.\n\nI should check if the command line in the Process Create event is typical. The command to remove the zip file is straightforward, but if that zip file was downloaded from an untrusted source, it could be a payload. The use of $env:Temp is common for temporary files, so that's not unusual. However, the fact that the script is deleting its own temporary files after execution might be an attempt to avoid leaving traces.\n\nAnother point is the repeated ImageLoaded events. While some DLLs are standard, the presence of MpOAV.dll might be related to the antivirus scanning the process. It's possible that the script is being blocked or monitored, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe user might need to investigate the source of the zip file, check if there are any other suspicious processes or network activity around the time of these events, and review the PowerShell script content if possible. They should also ensure that their antivirus and other security tools are up to date and configured properly to detect such activities.\n\nIn summary, while some of these activities are normal for PowerShell operations, the deletion of a zip file and the creation of a temporary script could be indicators of malicious behavior. Further investigation is needed to determine the context and intent behind these actions.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries provided appear to be system events related to process creation, file operations, and image loading, likely from Windows Security Event Logs. Here's a breakdown of the key activities and potential implications:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Activities and Analysis**\n\n#### **1. PowerShell Execution and File Deletion**\n- **Event**:  \n  ```json\n  {\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe', 'command_line': '\\\"powershell.exe\\\" & {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n  ```\n- **Analysis**:  \n  - **PowerShell** is used to delete all `.zip` files ending with `*entrada_principal.zip` from the Temp directory (`$env:Temp`).  \n  - **Suspicious Behavior**: Deleting files (especially from `Temp`) could indicate cleanup after malicious activity (e.g., removing evidence of downloaded payloads). The use of `-Force` bypasses confirmation prompts, which is common in automated scripts.  \n  - **Potential Risk**: If `*entrada_principal.zip` contains malicious content, this deletion might be part of an attack lifecycle (e.g., post-exploitation cleanup).\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Image Loading (DLLs)**\n- **Events**:  \n  ```json\n  {\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\mscoree.dll'}\"}\n  {\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows Defender\\\\Platform\\\\4.18.25050.5-0\\\\MpOAV.dll'}\"}\n  ```\n- **Analysis**:  \n  - **Legitimate DLLs**: `mscoree.dll` and `clr.dll` are standard .NET components used by PowerShell.  \n  - **Windows Defender DLL**: `MpOAV.dll` is part of Windows Defender's real-time protection. Its loading might indicate that the process is being monitored or blocked by the antivirus.  \n  - **Potential Risk**: While some DLLs are benign, the combination of PowerShell with Defender-related DLLs could indicate an attempt to bypass or interact with the antivirus.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. File Creation and Deletion**\n- **Events**:  \n  ```json\n  {\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'File created (rule: FileCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1'}\"}\n  {\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1'}\"}\n  ```\n- **Analysis**:  \n  - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted.  \n  - **Suspicious Behavior**: The script's name includes a random string (`rxszx2r5.rk2`), which is common in obfuscated or generated scripts. The immediate deletion suggests an attempt to avoid leaving forensic traces.  \n  - **Potential Risk**: This could be part of a malicious script execution chain (e.g., downloading and executing a payload).\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n- **Command-Line Activity**:  \n  - Use of `Remove-Item` with `-Force` to delete files from `Temp`.  \n  - Execution of a temporary script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) that is later deleted.  \n- **File Paths**:  \n  - Files in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\` (common for temporary storage).  \n  - Presence of `.zip` files with a specific naming pattern (`*entrada_principal.zip`).  \n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Source of the ZIP File**:  \n   - Check if `*entrada_principal.zip` was downloaded from an untrusted source (e.g., via phishing or malicious network traffic).  \n   - Analyze the contents of the ZIP file (if available) for malicious payloads (e.g., executables, scripts, or encoded data).\n\n2. **Audit PowerShell Scripts**:  \n   - Review the contents of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` (if recoverable) for obfuscation, command-line arguments, or network activity.  \n   - Monitor PowerShell execution policies (e.g., `Restricted`, `RemoteSigned`, `Unrestricted`) to ensure they are set to a secure level.\n\n3. **Check for Anomalies in Windows Defender Logs**:  \n   - Investigate whether `MpOAV.dll` was involved in blocking or detecting the activity.  \n   - Review Windows Defender's quarantine logs for any files flagged as malicious.\n\n4. **Network Traffic Analysis**:  \n   - Correlate the timing of these events with network traffic (e.g., outbound connections to external servers, data exfiltration).  \n   - Use tools like Wireshark or Zeek to inspect traffic patterns during this period.\n\n5. **Enable Logging for PowerShell**:  \n   - Enable PowerShell transcript logging or use `Set-PSDebug -Trace 1` to capture detailed command execution.  \n   - Monitor for unexpected script execution or use of `Invoke-WebRequest`\/`DownloadString` to fetch external payloads.\n\n6. **Consider Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:  \n   - Use EDR tools (e.g., CrowdStrike, SentinelOne) to detect and respond to suspicious behavior in real time.  \n   - Check for process injection, memory-resident malware, or lateral movement.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activities (e.g., loading .NET DLLs) are normal for PowerShell, the combination of **file deletion from Temp**, **temporary script creation\/deletion**, and **interaction with Windows Defender** raises concerns about potential malicious behavior. Further investigation is required to confirm whether this is a legitimate script or part of an attack."}
