{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being executed. That's common, but sometimes they can be used maliciously. Let me check the command lines. There's one line where cmd.exe is creating a service with a binPath that includes starting a script: \"c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\". The filename has \"NonExistingScript.ps1\", which might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to hide the script's existence by naming it as non-existent. Also, there's another sc.exe command creating another service with \"componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1\" â€“ same pattern. That seems suspicious because creating services with non-existent scripts could be part of a setup to execute malicious code later.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of registry value set events, which could indicate changes to system configurations. The services.exe and sc.exe activities might be related to modifying services. However, the fact that multiple registry events are logged might be normal, but combined with the service creation attempts, it raises a flag.\n\nAlso, there are image loaded events for urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate DLL, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a sign of something. However, the main concern here is the service creation with non-existent scripts. Even though the scripts aren't found, the attempt to create them might be part of a larger attack, like trying to establish persistence.\n\nBut wait, the scripts are named with \"NonExistingScript\", which might be a decoy or a way to confuse analysts. However, the presence of multiple service creation attempts and the use of cmd.exe and sc.exe to do so is still noteworthy. The confidence here might be around 0.7 because while there are suspicious activities, there's no direct evidence of malicious code execution yet. The logs don't show the actual execution of the scripts, just the attempts to create services pointing to them. However, the combination of these events could indicate an attempt to set up a backdoor or persistence mechanism.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated attempts to create services with non-existent scripts (e.g., 'unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1'), use of 'sc.exe' and 'cmd.exe' for service manipulation, and frequent registry modifications. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not. So, first, I'll look at each event.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's normal. But the file path has .winlogbeat.yml.new, which might be part of configuration. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several entries about ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe having registry value set events. Registry changes can be normal, but if done by unexpected processes, that's suspicious. However, Calculator.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe are common, so maybe not malicious. But PowerShell is often used for scripting, so maybe that's part of normal operations.\n\nThen there are a bunch of chrome.exe events. Most are registry value sets, which is a lot. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, so that's odd. Also, there are image loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are part of Windows Defender, so loading them is normal. But maybe if they were loaded from unexpected paths?\n\nWait, the paths for the image loaded are C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll and C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\... which are legitimate paths. So that's probably okay.\n\nLooking again at the chrome.exe events. So many registry changes. Maybe someone is trying to modify Chrome's settings or inject something. But why so many? Could be a sign of something trying to manipulate the browser, like changing settings for redirects or data collection. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe first event with winlogbeat creating a file might be part of normal operation, but maybe the .new file is a temporary file being created. Not sure if that's suspicious.\n\nThe other processes like Calculator and ApplicationFrameHost might be part of normal user activity. The PowerShell events could be part of scripts run by the user. \n\nBut the high number of registry changes by chrome.exe is unusual. Maybe that's the red flag here. However, without more information, like the specific registry keys being modified or other indicators of compromise, it's hard to be certain. \n\nSo, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" because of the unusual number of registry events from chrome.exe, but I'm not 100% confident. Maybe the confidence is around 0.6. But I need to check if there are other signs. The other events don't seem too bad. The winlogbeat file is in the Downloads folder, which is common for installations. \n\nHmm, maybe the justification is the multiple registry changes by chrome.exe, which could indicate malicious activity. But again, without knowing the exact changes, it's a bit uncertain. So the confidence might be moderate.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe instances triggered excessive registry modification events (RegistryEvent), which is unusual for a browser. This could indicate unauthorized configuration changes or potential malicious activity attempting to manipulate system settings.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
