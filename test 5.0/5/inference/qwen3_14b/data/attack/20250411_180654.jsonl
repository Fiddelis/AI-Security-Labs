{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. The first event is about svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization directory. Svchost.exe is a legitimate system process, and the path mentioned is part of the default Windows setup. The file name keyValueLKG.dat doesn't look suspicious. This might be normal system activity, so maybe not a threat here.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a temporary YAML file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a known tool for log collection, so this could be part of its normal operation. The file is a .new file, which is common during configuration updates. However, I should note that if winlogbeat isn't expected here, it might be worth checking. But since the file is in a standard location and the process is legitimate, this might not be an issue.\n\nThird, there's a file created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is a common tool, and creating a text file isn't inherently suspicious. However, the presence of a file named \"entrada_padrao.txt\" (which translates to \"standard input.txt\" in Portuguese) might be benign. But if there's no other context, like unusual commands or other suspicious activities, this alone might not be a red flag.\n\nNow, looking at the combination of all three events. All are file creation events by legitimate processes. None of the files are in unusual locations, and the processes are all known. There's no indication of malware or unauthorized activity here. The files created seem to be part of normal operations. Therefore, the batch doesn't show any signs of malicious behavior. The confidence level is high that this isn't interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) creating files in standard system or user directories. No suspicious file paths, unexpected process behavior, or security-relevant indicators observed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several entries with PowerShell.exe executing scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The command lines all have similar structures, with the script path varying but the log path pointing to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That's a red flag because keystroke logging is typically associated with malicious activities like keyloggers. The fact that the same script is being run multiple times from different directories might indicate an attempt to evade detection by changing locations.\n\nThen, there are events related to file creation and deletion. For example, a temporary file is created and then deleted, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces. The file names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 might be obfuscated or part of a script that's being executed temporarily.\n\nAlso, there's a log entry where the process is None, but the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' with a file path that includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That could mean the script is being executed remotely, which is another suspicious activity.\n\nHowever, there are also normal system processes like winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe creating files, which might be legitimate. But the repeated use of PowerShell for keystroke logging scripts is concerning. Windows Defender's image load events might be normal, but combined with the other activities, it's more suspicious.\n\nThe confidence level is high because multiple instances of the same malicious-looking script execution, along with temporary file creation and deletion, are strong indicators of potential malicious behavior. Even though some entries might be benign, the combination here is more likely to be a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with log paths pointing to $env:TEMP\\\\key.log, indicating potential keystroke logging. Repeated use of similar script paths across different directories suggests evasion techniques. File creation\/deletion events and remote command execution further raise suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nThen there are several entries about ProcessAccess and Registry value sets related to chrome.exe. Chrome accessing the registry multiple times might be normal, but repeated events could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe a browser extension or normal operation.\n\nWait, there's a whoami.exe process. That's a legitimate command to check user identity, but if it's being run in an unusual context, it could be part of a malicious activity. However, the command line here just shows the standard path, so maybe it's okay.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saves to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That's a red flag. Keystroke logging is typically associated with malware, like keyloggers. The script is being executed from a path that seems to be a local directory, but the name \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" is very telling. It's trying to capture keystrokes and save them to a temporary file, which is a common technique used by malicious software to steal sensitive information.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .NET DLLs. While .NET assemblies are used by legitimate software, the combination with the keystroke logging script suggests that PowerShell is being used in a way that's not typical for normal operations. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events might indicate that the PowerShell process is loading additional components, possibly to execute malicious code.\n\nAlso, there are several entries with the Provider Lifecycle task. Not sure what that refers to, but if it's related to PowerShell or other processes, it might be part of the same activity.\n\nPutting it all together: the key indicators are the execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a known malicious script for keylogging, and the multiple PowerShell activities that include loading various DLLs. Even though some events are normal (like chrome accessing the registry), the presence of the keystroke logger script is a strong indicator of malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious scripts (e.g., 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1') aimed at capturing keystrokes and saving logs to temporary files, combined with .NET DLL image loads, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
