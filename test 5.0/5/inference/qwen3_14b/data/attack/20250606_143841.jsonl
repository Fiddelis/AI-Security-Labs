First, there's a lot of Process Create events, which is normal because PowerShell is commonly used. But then there are multiple Image Load events with various .dll files. Some of these are standard like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's interesting because those are security-related DLLs. \n\nWait, but why are they being loaded by PowerShell? Maybe it's just normal operation, but then there's also a File Created event with a temporary script file, and then it's deleted. That could be part of a legitimate process, like a script that's run and then cleaned up. However, the repeated access to the registry and process events might indicate something more. \n\nAlso, the user 'fiddelis' is involved here. If this is a user account that's not typically used for administrative tasks, that might be a red flag. But without more context on the user, it's hard to say. The fact that multiple Image Loads are happening might be part of a PowerShell script that's loading various components, which could be normal or could be part of an exploit. \n\nAnother point is that there are multiple ProcessAccess events. That could mean that other processes are interacting with PowerShell, which might be normal, but if it's unexpected, it could be malicious. However, I don't see any clear signs of malware here, like unexpected network activity or unusual command-line arguments. The command line for one of the processes is just \"& {}\", which is an empty command, which might be a test or a placeholder. \n\nPutting this all together, the presence of multiple Image Loads from security-related DLLs and temporary files being created and deleted might be suspicious.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. That's common, but when combined with other events, it might be suspicious. There's also cmd.exe and whoami.exe. The whoami.exe is typically used to get user information, which isn't necessarily bad, but in combination with other actions could be part of an attack.\n\nNow, the events include several 'Image loaded' entries. The files loaded are mostly system-related, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and some .ni.dll files. These are part of the .NET framework, so that's normal. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus software, so again, normal unless there's something unusual here.\n\nWait, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be a sign of something trying to execute a script without leaving traces. Also, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell might indicate that it's being used to load additional components or modules, which could be part of a malicious payload.\n\nAnother point is the repeated 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell. If a process is being accessed multiple times, especially if it's not typical for the system, that could be a red flag. But on its own, it's not enough. However, when combined with the file creation and deletion, and the loading of various DLLs, it might suggest that PowerShell is being used in a way that's not standard.\n\nAlso, the command line for one of the PowerShell processes is \"& {}\", which is an empty command. That might be a placeholder or a way to bypass certain checks. But again, without more context, it's hard to say. However, the fact that there's a script file created and then immediately deleted could be an attempt to execute a script and then clean up after itself, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell processes, loading of system DLLs, creation and deletion of a temporary script file. These could be signs of a legitimate script execution, but the combination of these events, especially the temporary file being created and deleted, might indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity. The presence of Windows Defender's DLLs might be a red herring, but the overall pattern of PowerShell activity with file operations could be suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with frequent 'Process accessed' and 'Image loaded' events, combined with creation\/deletion of a temporary script file, suggest potential malicious activity or script execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. That's common in many scenarios, but when combined with certain actions, it can be suspicious. Let me check the tasks associated with these processes.\n\nThere's a ProcessCreate event for whoami.exe, which is a normal command to check user identity. But then there's a PowerShell process that's creating a new PSDrive with the command \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\". Wait, the command line here has a typo: \"unidade_auxiliar\" instead of \"unit_auxiliary\" or something similar. That might be a red flag because it's not standard PowerShell syntax. Also, the use of UNC paths like \\\\Target\\\\C$ suggests accessing a remote system's C$ share, which is often used in attacks to access remote machines.\n\nThen, there are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs, including some related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender. While loading these DLLs isn't inherently malicious, the combination with other activities might be. The FileCreate event for a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1) is created and then immediately deleted. This could indicate that the script was used to execute some commands and then cleaned up to avoid detection. The presence of such a file, even if temporary, might be part of a script execution that's trying to be stealthy.\n\nAlso, the repeated ProcessAccess and Registry value set events might indicate that PowerShell is being used to modify system settings or access other processes, which could be part of a larger attack. The fact that the same PowerShell process is creating files, loading images, and accessing the registry multiple times might suggest that it's part of a multi-stage attack or persistence mechanism.\n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these activities could be legitimate. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and loading .NET DLLs is normal. But the combination of creating a temporary script file, accessing remote shares, and the suspicious command line syntax points towards potential malicious activity. The deletion of the script file after creation is a common tactic used by malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\nConfidence-wise, while there are some suspicious elements, they might not be conclusive on their own. But when taken together, the pattern does suggest a need for further investigation. So I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's whoami.exe and powershell.exe being created or accessed. The whoami.exe is a legitimate Windows tool that shows the current user's identity. But then there's a lot of powershell.exe activities. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to note.\n\nLooking further, there's a process that creates a file in the DeliveryOptimization directory. That path is part of Windows' built-in services, so maybe that's normal. However, the next events show multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and images loaded. The images loaded include mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. That's normal for PowerShell, but the number of times it's happening might be a red flag.\n\nThen there's a command line in one of the process creates. The command checks if a file exists at \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\". The path here seems a bit suspicious because of the \"..\\\\registro_secundario\" part. Procdump.exe is a legitimate tool from Sysinternals, but the way the path is structured might indicate an attempt to obfuscate or access files in unexpected directories. Also, the use of \"..\\\\\" could be a way to navigate up a directory tree, which sometimes is used in attacks to avoid direct access to sensitive areas.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. That's common for PowerShell scripts, but the fact that it's created and then immediately deleted might be part of a cleanup process. However, if the script itself is malicious, that could be a concern. The event shows that the file is deleted, which might be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be normal, but combined with the other PowerShell activities, it's worth looking into. Also, the registry value set event could indicate changes to system settings, which might be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch has multiple PowerShell processes, some unusual file paths, and a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious activities. The key points are the repeated PowerShell usage, the command line checking for procdump.exe in a possibly obfuscated path, and the temporary file creation\/deletion. These could be signs of an investigation-worthy scenario, especially if the procdump.exe is being used for dumping memory or other malicious purposes. However, without more context, it's a bit tricky. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities are normal, but the combination of events does raise red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious command-line arguments, including a path check for 'procdump.exe' in a potentially obfuscated directory structure.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each entry one by one.\n\nFirst event: PowerShell.exe has a task 'Image loaded' pointing to a file in the Windows Defender directory. That might be normal, but I should check if the path is legitimate. The file is MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. Hmm, maybe that's a legitimate process, but maybe not. Sometimes attackers can use legitimate processes for malicious activities. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, another PowerShell event with a file created in the user's AppData folder. That's a common place for malware to store files. The filename is StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Doesn't ring a bell immediately, but creating files in AppData could be suspicious.\n\nThen, several registry value set events and process accessed events related to PowerShell. Multiple 'Process accessed' events might indicate that PowerShell is being used to manipulate other processes or access system resources. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used in attacks for its powerful scripting capabilities.\n\nThere are also instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed. That's a normal command to check user context, but if it's done multiple times, maybe part of an attack to gather information. However, alone, it's not suspicious.\n\nThe most concerning event is the 'cmd.exe' command to disable the firewall using 'netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off'. Disabling the firewall is a clear sign of malicious activity. This would allow the attacker to bypass firewall protections, making it easier to exploit the system or move laterally in the network. This is a strong indicator of a potential security threat.\n\nThen there's 'netsh.exe' being used to set the firewall state off. That's the same command as before, confirming the firewall is being disabled. This is a critical point because it's a direct action to compromise the system's defenses.\n\nThe svchost.exe events are related to registry changes. svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but excessive registry modifications could indicate that an attacker is trying to alter system configurations or inject malicious code. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. But combined with the firewall disable command, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting this all together: The presence of PowerShell creating files in AppData, multiple process accesses, and the explicit command to disable the firewall are strong indicators of malicious behavior. Even though some events involve legitimate processes, the combination of these actions suggests an attempt to compromise the system. The firewall disable is a major red flag. So, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events with suspicious file creation in user AppData, combined with a direct attempt to disable Windows Firewall via netsh command, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are several PowerShell commands being executed. The first event has a command line that uses New-PSDrive to create a new drive mapping to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That seems suspicious because mapping a network drive, especially to a remote system (like C$ which is a default administrative share), could be part of an attack, like trying to access files on another machine.\n\nThen there are a bunch of other PowerShell commands, but most of them are just empty blocks {} or exit commands. Those might be benign, maybe just testing or placeholder commands. However, the repeated occurrence of these commands might be part of a larger attack pattern. \n\nLooking at the later entries, there's a command that checks if a file called procdump.exe exists in a specific path. Procdump is a legitimate tool used for capturing memory dumps, but if it's being checked for existence in a non-standard location, that could be part of an attacker's attempt to use it for malicious purposes, like dumping memory from a process to analyze it or extract sensitive information.\n\nThe winlog tasks mention 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle', which are part of the Windows Event Log system. However, the combination of these PowerShell commands, especially the drive mapping and the check for procdump.exe, raises some red flags. The fact that the same command is repeated multiple times might indicate an automated process or a script that's trying to establish access or check for tools.\n\nBut wait, are there any other indicators? The first event's command line is trying to map a drive to a remote machine's C$ share, which is a common target for attackers. If this is part of a lateral movement, that's a big red flag. However, without more context, like other events showing actual data exfiltration or unauthorized access, it's a bit tricky. But the presence of the drive mapping and the repeated checks for procdump.exe could be indicative of an attack chain.\n\nConsidering all this, even though some commands are benign, the combination of the drive mapping and the procdump check is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are from svchost.exe, which is a common Windows process that hosts various system services. The winlog task is \"Registry object added or deleted (rule: RegistryEvent)\" each time. Now, svchost.exe is legitimate, but it's also a common vector for malware because it can host multiple services.\n\nHowever, in this batch, all the events are the same: svchost.exe triggering a registry event. There's no variation in the process names, no additional details like different registry keys being modified, or any other processes involved. This repetition might indicate a benign system update or a service starting up, which is normal. But since all events are identical and there's no other context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious. \n\nOn the other hand, if this were part of a larger set of events with other suspicious activities, it might be more concerning. But here, without more information, the same process doing the same action repeatedly could be normal. However, the lack of variation might also suggest that something is wrong, like a script or malware repeatedly modifying the registry. \n\nBut considering that svchost.exe is a standard process and the events are all the same, it's possible that this is just part of regular system operations. However, the high number of events (28 entries) might be a red flag. Typically, a legitimate process wouldn't generate so many identical registry events in a short time. \n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided timestamps or any other context. Without knowing when these events occurred, it's hard to assess if they're clustered in a short period. If they're spread out over time, they might be normal. But if they're all in a short span, that's suspicious. \n\nSince the user hasn't given timestamps, I have to go with the information provided. The repetition and lack of variation might be a sign of something malicious, but it's not definitive. However, the classification here is about whether the batch is interesting for investigation. Given that all events are the same and from a legitimate process, but the volume is high, it's on the edge. \n\nIn many cases, repeated registry changes by svchost.exe could be part of a legitimate service, but they could also be part of a malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The classification might lean towards \"interesting\" because of the high number of identical events, even though the process is legitimate. But if the system is normally generating these events, then it's not interesting. \n\nSince the user is asking for classification based on the entire batch, and considering that the same event repeated multiple times could indicate an anomaly, I think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" with a moderate confidence.

My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, most of the logs are about svchost.exe triggering registry events, like \"Registry object added or deleted\" and \"Registry value set\". Then there's one entry about a pipe created. But then, there are several entries where the process is powershell.exe running a command to create a new PSDrive, mapping a network share (\\\\Target\\\\C$) to drive G. The command line is similar in each case, and the winlog task is \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\".\n\nHmm. svchost.exe is a normal Windows process that hosts various system services. However, if it's generating a lot of registry events, that might be normal or could be part of a malicious activity. But the key point here is the PowerShell commands. Creating a PSDrive to map a network share could be part of an attack, like establishing a connection to a remote system for data exfiltration or command execution. The repetition of the same command across multiple logs might indicate that this is part of a persistent or ongoing activity.\n\nHowever, I should check if these PowerShell commands are legitimate. The command uses \"New-PSDrive\" with a network share, which could be a legitimate action if, for example, a user is accessing a remote machine. But in the context of a security log, if this is happening multiple times and in conjunction with other suspicious activities (like registry changes), it might be a red flag.\n\nWait, but the other entries are all about svchost.exe and registry events. The PowerShell commands are separate. Are they related? Maybe the registry changes are part of a larger attack, and the PowerShell commands are a separate part. However, the fact that there are multiple PowerShell entries with the same command line might suggest automation or a script being run repeatedly. Also, the use of \"unidade_auxiliar\" (which is Portuguese for \"auxiliary unit\") in the command line might be a red flag, as it's not standard terminology in PowerShell. That could be a sign of obfuscation or a non-English attacker.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry events from svchost.exe could be normal, but the repeated PowerShell commands creating a network drive mapping might indicate an attempt to access a remote system. The combination of these two could be interesting. However, I need to consider if this is a false positive. For example, if the system is part of a domain and these are legitimate administrative tasks, but without more context, the presence of repeated suspicious commands and registry events would warrant further investigation.\n\nSo, the classification here would be \"INTERESTING\" because the batch includes multiple PowerShell commands that map a network share, which is a common technique in attacks, combined with registry events that might indicate system changes.

The script checks if a file exists at \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..\\registro_secundario\\procdump.exe\". If it exists, it exits 0; else, 1. The winlog task is \"Engine Lifecycle\" and file is None.\n\nHmm, the command line is checking for the existence of procdump.exe. Procdump is a legitimate tool from Sysinternals, often used for dumping processes. But why is this check happening? Maybe the attacker is checking if procdump is present before using it. However, in these logs, the check is just exiting based on presence, not actually doing anything else. \n\nWait, both events are the same. The same PowerShell command run twice. The task is \"Engine Lifecycle\", which might be part of some automated process. But why would that process check for procdump.exe? If procdump isn't present, the exit code is 1. But without more context, like subsequent events where procdump is actually used, this might just be a benign check. \n\nBut maybe this is part of a larger attack. For example, the attacker might be checking if procdump exists to decide whether to proceed with dumping memory. However, in the given logs, there's no indication that procdump is being executed or that any malicious activity is occurring beyond the check. \n\nThe justification for classification would depend on whether this check is part of a known malicious pattern. Since the logs only show the check and not the actual use of procdump, it's ambiguous. However, the presence of procdump in the path could be suspicious if it's not a standard location. But the path here is \"registro_secundario\", which might be a translated or non-standard directory name. \n\nBut the user said to consider the entire batch. Since both events are the same and only involve checking for a file, without any other malicious activity, it's not conclusive. However, the fact that the check is happening could be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is preparing to use procdump later. But without more data, it's hard to tell. \n\nConfidence would be moderate. It's not a clear-cut attack, but the presence of a check for a tool like procdump might warrant further investigation. So, classification might be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6.
