{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided data, here is a detailed analysis of the events:\n\n### 1. **Initial PowerShell Activity**\n   - **Event**: A PowerShell process was created with the command line `powershell.exe`.\n   - **Analysis**: This indicates that a user or script initiated a PowerShell session. It is common for attackers to use PowerShell for lateral movement and execution of malicious scripts.\n\n### 2. **File Deletion Attempt**\n   - **Event**: The `Dism.exe` process deleted the file `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\\\WimProvider.dll`.\n   - **Analysis**: This could be an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after malicious activity. However, `dism.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool used for image management, so further investigation is needed to determine if this deletion was malicious.\n\n### 3. **Registry Modification**\n   - **Event**: The PowerShell process modified a registry value.\n   - **Analysis**: Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware. This activity should be closely monitored to ensure no unauthorized changes were made.\n\n### 4. **File Creation and Access**\n   - **Event**: A file was created at `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`.\n   - **Analysis**: This could be part of legitimate PowerShell profile initialization, but it is worth verifying the contents of this file to ensure it does not contain malicious scripts or commands.\n\n### 5. **Final Command Execution**\n   - **Event**: A command was executed using PowerShell with the following parameters:\n     ```\n     powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';\n     ```\n   - **Analysis**: The use of `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` suggests that the script is attempting to run in a restricted environment. This could be an attempt to execute malicious code while limiting privileges or evading detection.\n\n### 6. **Process and File Activity Summary**\n   - **Processes**:\n     - `powershell.exe`: Multiple instances were created, indicating potential scripting activity.\n     - `Dism.exe`: Invoked for file deletion, which may indicate cleanup activity.\n   - **Files**:\n     - Temporary files were deleted (`WimProvider.dll`).\n     - A new profile data file was created in the PowerShell directory.\n\n### 7. **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n   - **Registry Manipulation**: Could indicate persistence or configuration changes.\n   - **File Deletion**: May suggest an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.\n   - **PowerShell Execution with Restricted Policy**: Potentially suspicious, especially if the script is unknown.\n\n### 8. **Recommendations**\n   - **Investigate Registry Changes**: Review the registry modifications made by the PowerShell process for any unauthorized changes.\n   - **Analyze Temporary Files**: Check the contents of `WimProvider.dll` and other temporary files to ensure they are legitimate.\n   - **Monitor PowerShell Activity**: Continuously monitor PowerShell activity, especially scripts executed with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`.\n   - **Review File Operations**: Ensure that file creation and deletion activities align with expected behavior for the user or process.\n\n### 9. **Conclusion**\nThe observed activity shows signs of potential malicious behavior, particularly the use of PowerShell with restricted execution policies and file deletion attempts. While some actions could be legitimate (e.g., system administration tasks), the combination of events raises red flags that warrant further investigation to rule out compromise."}
