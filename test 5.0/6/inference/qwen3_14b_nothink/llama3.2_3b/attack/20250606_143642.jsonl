{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the log entries you've provided, it appears that a **PowerShell script** has been executed on the system, and several suspicious activities have been logged. Here's a breakdown and analysis of the events:\n\n---\n\n### üîç **1. File Deletion Detected**\n**Event:**\n```json\n{\"task\": \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\", \"file\": {\"path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force\"}}\n```\n\n**Action:**\n- A file named `*entrada_principal.zip` was deleted from the **Temp directory**.\n- The command used: `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The use of `Remove-Item` with `-Force` is a common PowerShell technique to delete files, possibly to remove evidence of malicious activity.\n- The use of `*` in the file name suggests a pattern match, potentially deleting multiple files with similar names.\n- This is often seen in **malicious scripts** or **clean-up routines** after exploitation or execution of payloads.\n\n---\n\n### üîç **2. PowerShell Script Execution**\n**Event:**\n```json\n{\"task\": \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\", \"process\": {\"name\": \"powershell.exe\", \"command_line\": \"\\\"powershell.exe\\\" & {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}\"}}\n```\n\n**Action:**\n- A **PowerShell process** was created, and the script executed was:\n  ```powershell\n  Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force\n  ```\n- This script deletes all `.zip` files in the **Temp directory** that match the pattern `*entrada_principal.zip`.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- This is a **basic but suspicious** command that could be part of a larger malicious script.\n- The deletion of files in the **Temp directory** is a common tactic used by attackers to **clean up** traces after execution.\n\n---\n\n### üîç **3. PowerShell Access and Image Load Events**\n**Events:**\n- **Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)**\n- **Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)**\n\n**Examples:**\n- `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`\n- `MpOAV.dll` (from Windows Defender)\n\n**Analysis:**\n- These logs indicate that **PowerShell is actively running** and loading **native modules**.\n- The loading of `MpOAV.dll` is **normal** (part of Windows Defender), but the overall pattern may still be **suspicious** depending on context.\n\n---\n\n### üîç **4. File Creation and Deletion in Temp Directory**\n**Events:**\n- **File created** at `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`\n- **File deleted** at the same location\n\n**Analysis:**\n- This is a **common pattern** in PowerShell-based attacks:\n  1. A **script is created** in the Temp directory.\n  2. The **script is executed**.\n  3. The **script is deleted** to avoid detection.\n- This is consistent with **malicious activity** (e.g., **payload execution and cleanup**).\n\n---\n\n### üîç **5. Registry Value Set**\n**Event:**\n```json\n{\"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\", \"process\": {\"name\": \"powershell.exe\"}}\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n- This indicates that **PowerShell is modifying the registry**, which could be used to:\n  - **Persistence** (e.g., adding a registry entry to run a script at startup)\n  - **Configuration changes** (e.g., disabling security features)\n- This is **highly suspicious** and should be investigated further.\n\n---\n\n### üö® **Summary of Suspicious Activities**\n| Event Type | Description | Potential Risk |\n|------------|-------------|----------------|\n| File Deletion | Deletion of `*entrada_principal.zip` in Temp directory | Likely cleanup after script execution |\n| PowerShell Execution | Execution of script to delete files | Possible malicious activity |\n| File Creation\/Deletion | Temporary script file created and then deleted | Likely part of an attack chain |\n| Registry Modification | PowerShell modifying registry | Potential for persistence or configuration changes |\n\n---\n\n### üîç **Next Steps**\n1. **Investigate the source of the PowerShell script**:\n   - Was it initiated by a user or a scheduled task?\n   - Is there any link to **phishing emails**, **malicious websites**, or **unauthorized access**?\n\n2. **Check for other suspicious PowerShell scripts** in the **Temp directory** or elsewhere on the system.\n\n3. **Review system logs** for any other **unauthorized access** or **unusual activity**.\n\n4. **Check for signs of persistence** (e.g., registry keys, scheduled tasks, or startup scripts).\n\n5. **Run a full system scan** with up-to-date **antivirus or EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)** tools.\n\n---\n\n### üõ°Ô∏è **Recommendations**\n- **Restrict PowerShell usage** where not needed (e.g., use `Set-ExecutionPolicy` to limit script execution).\n- **Monitor PowerShell activity** closely using tools like **Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)** or **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**.\n- **Enable logging** for PowerShell and **audit PowerShell execution**.\n- **Investigate the user account** that ran the script (`fiddelis`) to ensure it is authorized and not compromised.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you **write a PowerShell script to analyze similar logs** or **generate an alert** for such activities. Let me know!"}
