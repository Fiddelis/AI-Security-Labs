{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided log entries, here's a **summary and analysis** of the observed events, particularly focusing on **process creation, file operations, and suspicious activity** that might indicate **malicious behavior** or **unusual system activity**:\n\n---\n\n## üìå **Overview of Events**\n\n### 1. **Process Creation Events**\n- **powershell.exe** is repeatedly being created with various rules, which is common in Windows environments.\n- **whoami.exe** is also created once, which is a standard utility for checking the current user.\n- **Dism.exe** is created once, which is a legitimate system tool used for deployment imaging.\n\n### 2. **File Operations**\n- **File Deletion**:\n  - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\WimProvider.dll` was deleted.\n  - This might be part of a **clean-up or malicious activity** to remove evidence.\n- **File Creation**:\n  - A file named `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` was created in the **PowerShell startup directory**.\n  - This might be an **attempt to persist** or **execute code** later.\n\n### 3. **Image Load Events**\n- **mscoree.dll**, **clr.dll**, and **mscoreei.dll** were loaded by **powershell.exe**.\n- These are standard .NET components and are not inherently malicious, but their loading can be used to **execute .NET-based payloads**.\n\n### 4. **Pipe Created**\n- A **pipe** was created by `powershell.exe`, which can be used for **inter-process communication (IPC)**.\n- While not inherently suspicious, it can be used by malware to communicate with other processes or exfiltrate data.\n\n---\n\n## üîç **Suspicious Patterns and Indications**\n\n### 1. **Repetitive PowerShell Usage**\n- PowerShell is used multiple times to **create processes**, **delete files**, **load images**, and **create pipes**.\n- **Command line example:**\n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe & {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}\n  ```\n  - This command is deleting a zip file in the **Temp directory**, possibly **cleaning up evidence** of a download.\n\n### 2. **File Deletion in Temp Directory**\n- The deletion of a file named `WimProvider.dll` in the **Temp directory** could be an attempt to **remove evidence** of a **malicious payload** or **downloaded component**.\n\n### 3. **File Creation in PowerShell Startup Directory**\n- Creation of a file in the **StartupProfileData** directory may be an attempt to **persist** or **execute PowerShell scripts** in the future.\n\n### 4. **Registry Value Set**\n- There's an entry indicating a **registry value was set** by `powershell.exe`.\n- This could be used to **modify system behavior**, such as **disabling security features**, **changing execution policies**, or **modifying startup scripts**.\n\n---\n\n## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Malicious Behavior Indicators**\n\n| Event | Possible Indicator |\n|-------|---------------------|\n| `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force` | Attempting to delete evidence of a zip file that might contain malicious content. |\n| File creation in `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` | May be an attempt to **persist** or **execute PowerShell scripts** at startup. |\n| Multiple `powershell.exe` process creations | PowerShell is a common tool for **malicious scripting**, especially when used in **unusual ways** or **without user interaction**. |\n| Image load of `.dll` files | These are .NET components, but can be used to **execute payloads** or **load malicious code**. |\n| Pipe creation | Could be used for **inter-process communication**, **exfiltration**, or **malware communication**. |\n\n---\n\n## üõ°Ô∏è **Recommended Actions**\n\n### 1. **Investigate PowerShell Activity**\n- Check the **execution policy** of PowerShell.\n- Analyze the **command lines** for **obfuscation**, **unusual parameters**, or **unauthorized scripts**.\n- Monitor for **unusual script execution** or **unauthorized file modifications**.\n\n### 2. **Investigate File Deletion**\n- Review the **deleted file** `WimProvider.dll` for **malicious content**.\n- Check if it was **downloaded from an untrusted source** or **linked to a suspicious process**.\n\n### 3. **Monitor for Persistence**\n- Investigate the **StartupProfileData-NonInteractive** file for **malicious scripts** or **unauthorized PowerShell configurations**.\n\n### 4. **Audit Registry Changes**\n- Review the **registry key** that was modified to ensure it was **legitimate** and **not part of a malicious configuration**.\n\n### 5. **Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools**\n- Tools like **Microsoft Defender**, **CrowdStrike**, or **Carbon Black** can **detect and respond** to suspicious activity like this.\n\n---\n\n## ‚úÖ **Summary**\n\n- The logs show **normal process creation**, **file operations**, and **PowerShell usage**.\n- However, there are **suspicious patterns** such as **file deletion**, **file creation in startup directories**, and **repeated use of PowerShell**, which may indicate **malicious activity**.\n- Further **investigation** is recommended to **validate** the **legitimacy** of these events and **prevent potential threats**.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a **SIEM rule** or **query** to detect similar activity in **Splunk**, **ELK**, or **Microsoft Sentinel**?"}
