{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the entries are about chrome.exe making network connections. That's normal, right? Browsers often connect to various sites. But then there are several entries related to powershell.exe. Now, PowerShell can be a double-edged sword. It's commonly used for scripting, but it's also a tool that attackers might use for malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the specific events for PowerShell: there's a process creation with a command line that includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\\Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. These commands are gathering information about the system's users, groups, and stored credentials. That's a red flag. Why would someone run all these commands? It looks like information-gathering, which is often part of the reconnaissance phase in an attack.\n\nThen there's the file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script. Creating a temporary script and then deleting it could be an attempt to hide evidence. Also, the image loaded events point to .NET assemblies, which might be part of a payload or a legitimate process, but combined with the other activities, it's suspicious.\n\nThe repeated Provider Lifecycle events might not be significant on their own, but when paired with the other activities, they could indicate that the script is running multiple times or being monitored. Also, the fact that the same command line is repeated several times suggests automation or a script that's executing multiple commands in sequence.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any possibility of false positives. Maybe this is a legitimate script run by an admin? But the combination of network connections from Chrome, PowerShell gathering system info, creating and deleting temp files, and loading .NET DLLs makes me think this is more likely malicious. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of a breach, but the pattern of events is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including system reconnaissance commands (net user, get-localgroup), temporary script creation\/deletion, and loading of .NET assemblies, which are commonly associated with malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to go through each entry and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a normal activity, maybe part of an installation or configuration. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe command with a long command line that includes net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, and listing directories in C:\\Users. This seems like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users, groups, and stored credentials. That's a red flag. The command is using multiple system utilities to collect sensitive info, which is typical in reconnaissance phases of an attack.\n\nThen there are several entries for net.exe user and net.exe localgroup, which are standard commands to check user accounts and groups. But when combined with the previous PowerShell command, it might indicate an attacker mapping the system.\n\nThe PowerShell process creating a file named pacote_ativo.txt. Not sure what that is, but creating files in user directories isn't necessarily bad. However, if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be malicious.\n\nChrome.exe has multiple registry value set events. That's unusual. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry that much. Maybe a malicious extension or a compromise. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, multiple events here might indicate something.\n\nThe image loaded events for urlmon.dll and combase.dll are normal system files, so probably not an issue. SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll is also normal, as that's part of the Windows system.\n\nThe updater.exe from Google seems legitimate, but the command line is long. However, it's part of Google's updater, so unless there's a known issue, it's probably okay.\n\nThe Security Group Management events with no process involved might be related to group policy or Active Directory, but without more info, it's hard to tell. They could be benign.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious part is the PowerShell command that's enumerating system information. That's a common initial step in attacks. The multiple registry changes by Chrome might be a concern, but without more data, it's not definitive. The file creation by winlogbeat is normal. However, the combination of system enumeration and unusual registry activity could indicate a potential security incident. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, as the PowerShell activity is suspicious but not conclusive on its own.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains PowerShell commands enumerating system details (users, groups, credentials) and multiple registry modifications by Chrome, which may indicate reconnaissance or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: net1.exe is running with the command line 'net1 localgroup'. Wait, the name is net1.exe, but the command is 'net1 localgroup'. That seems odd because the standard 'net localgroup' command is part of the Windows net.exe tool. Maybe there's a typo here, like the process name is misspelled as 'net1.exe' instead of 'net.exe'? That could be a red flag. If the process is named net1.exe but executing a command that's part of the legitimate net.exe, that might be a sign of a malicious file trying to mimic a legitimate one.\n\nNext, there's a file created by powershell.exe at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. That path seems a bit unusual. The StartupProfileData-NonInteractive might be related to PowerShell profiles, but I'm not sure if that's normal. Maybe it's a legitimate profile, but I should note it as a potential area to check.\n\nThen, conhost.exe is involved in a registry value set event. Conhost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, so unless there's something unusual in the registry changes, this might not be suspicious. But I need to check if the registry changes are normal.\n\nThe next event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and sending logs, so that's probably normal. The path is in the Downloads directory, which is common for such files. However, the same file is mentioned again later, which might be redundant but not necessarily suspicious.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event creates a file called modulo_base.txt. That's a generic name; maybe it's just a regular file, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, if this file is part of a larger malicious activity, it might be relevant.\n\nThe MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process is running with a command line that includes '\/ua \/installsource scheduler'. The command line seems legitimate for an update process. The image loaded event points to taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate system file. So that might be normal.\n\nThe svchost.exe process is involved in a registry value set. Again, svchost.exe is a standard Windows process, so unless the registry changes are unusual, this might not be a problem.\n\nThen there's another powershell.exe event with a process accessed and a registry value set. These are common activities but could be part of something malicious if combined with other events.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious part is the first event with net1.exe. The name discrepancy between the process and the command could indicate a malicious file. However, the other events don't show clear signs of compromise. The presence of winlogbeat and PowerShell creating files might be normal, but the net1.exe event stands out. However, without more context, like if the file is in a non-standard location or if there are other anomalies, it's a bit hard to be certain. But since the user is asking for a classification, the presence of that one suspicious event might be enough to flag it as interesting, though with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The first event shows 'net1.exe' executing a command resembling 'net localgroup', which may indicate a suspicious process name (net1.exe vs. legitimate net.exe). Other events involve PowerShell and file creation, which are common but could be part of benign activities. The combination of unusual process names and typical system events warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
