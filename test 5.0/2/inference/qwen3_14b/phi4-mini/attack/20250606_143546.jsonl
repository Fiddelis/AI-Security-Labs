The first thing I notice is the creation of a file called identity_helper.exe in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. That path seems a bit off because Edge typically doesn't have an identity_helper.exe. Maybe it's a legitimate file, but sometimes malware uses similar names.\n\nThen there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. PowerShell is common, but the commands here are suspicious. There's a New-Service command creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to tarefa_logico.exe. That file is in a strange location: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\. The name \"tarefa_logico.exe\" doesn't ring a bell as a standard Windows executable. Also, the fact that PowerShell is being used to create and start a service is a red flag. Malware often uses PowerShell for such actions to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, PowerShell is loading various .NET DLLs, which is normal, but the presence of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender might be a sign that the malware is trying to interact with or bypass the antivirus. However, those are legitimate files, so that might not be conclusive on its own.\n\nThe file creation and deletion in the Temp directory is common for scripts, but the fact that the script is named with a random string and then immediately deleted could be an attempt to hide its presence. The use of __PSScriptPolicyTest in the filename might be a misleading name to appear benign, but the actions taken by the script are more telling.\n\nThere's also multiple Registry value set events from RuntimeBroker.exe and services.exe. While some registry changes are normal, excessive or unusual changes can indicate configuration of malware or persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if these are malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious points are the creation of a non-standard service via PowerShell, the use of a suspicious binary path, and the potential for the script to execute malicious code. Even though some elements are normal (like PowerShell usage and loading .NET DLLs), the combination of these events points towards possible malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because some files and processes are legitimate, but the overall pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events indicate potential malicious activity, including creation of a suspicious service (objeto_ativo) with a non-standard binary path (tarefa_logico.exe), file creation\/deletion in temp directory, and loading of potentially malicious DLLs.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed or created. The first event is Process accessed for powershell.exe. Then there's a Process Create for whoami.exe, which is a legitimate command, but then another Process Create for powershell.exe with a command line that looks suspicious. The command line includes importing a module from a path that seems odd, like \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The use of \"..\\\\\" suggests moving up directories, which might be a red flag. Also, the command line has some obfuscation with the backslashes and quotes. That seems like it could be part of a malicious script.\n\nNext, there are several Image Load events for powershell.exe loading DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, and clr.dll. These are .NET related DLLs, which might be normal, but combined with the other events, it's worth noting. Then there's a File created in the Temp directory, which is common for malware to drop files. However, the next event deletes that same file, which might be an attempt to clean up traces. The Pipe Created event could be related to inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad but might be part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking at other processes like svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, their events seem more benignâ€”like creating files in system directories or modifying registry values. However, the repeated activity around powershell.exe with suspicious command lines and file operations stands out. The use of the Temp directory for creating and then deleting a file could indicate an attempt to execute a script temporarily without leaving evidence. The path mentioned in the command line also has some unusual directory structures, which might be an indicator of malicious activity.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. The presence of multiple suspicious events related to PowerShell, along with the file creation and deletion in Temp, and the obfuscated command line, all point towards potential malicious behavior. However, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack yet. The classification is likely \"INTERESTING\" because these activities are indicative of possible exploitation or script-based attacks, even if not confirmed. The confidence would be around 0.8 because while there are clear red flags, it's not definitive proof without further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including obfuscated command lines importing modules from unusual paths, temporary file creation\/deletion, and loading of .NET DLLs.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. First, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are related to svchost.exe creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory. The files mentioned are things like UpdateAgent.dll, Mitigation.dll, and others. These are all .dll files, which are typically legitimate system components. However, the path is C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\... which is a known location for Windows Update to store files. So, creating files here might be normal during an update process.\n\nBut wait, the names of the DLLs are a bit generic. Also, there are multiple files being created in the Metadata subdirectory. The SoftwareDistribution folder is part of the Windows Update client, so this could be part of a normal update. However, the presence of multiple files being created might be suspicious if they're not part of a known update package. But without more context, like the exact version or the source, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there are some registry value set events from svchost.exe. Registry changes are common during updates, so that might not be an issue. However, if there's a pattern of registry changes that's not typical, that could be a red flag. But again, the logs don't show the specific registry keys being modified, so I can't say for sure.\n\nAnother point is that svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but it's known for hosting various system services. If it's creating files in the SoftwareDistribution folder, that's usually part of the Windows Update process. However, the presence of multiple such events might indicate a large update or a potential issue if the files are not expected.\n\nAlso, there's an event where backgroundTaskHost.exe loads urlmon.dll, and msedgewebview2.exe loads BitsProxy.dll. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. But if these processes are doing something unusual, like loading unexpected DLLs, that could be a problem. However, the logs only mention the standard system DLLs here.\n\nThe file created events also include an ETL file (waasmedic.20250606_143612_048.etl) which is a performance log file. These are typically created by system tools and are normal. The edbtmp.log files are part of the Windows Update DataStore, which is used for logging, so again, that's normal.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these events seem to be related to normal Windows Update activities. The svchost.exe process is involved in creating files as part of the update process, and the registry changes might be part of configuration updates. However, the sheer number of events could be a sign of a large update or possibly a malicious activity if the files being created are not part of a legitimate update. But without more information, like the source of the files or any other anomalous behavior, it's hard to determine if this is malicious.\n\nI need to check if there's any indication that the files are not legitimate. For example, if the files were created in unusual locations or if the process that created them is not the expected one. However, all the files here are in standard Windows Update directories, and svchost.exe is a legitimate process. The names of the DLLs are similar to those found in Windows updates, though they might be part of a specific update package.\n\nGiven that, I think the batch is not particularly interesting because the events align with normal system behavior related to Windows updates. However, the confidence isn't 100% because without more context, it's possible that these events could be part of a larger attack. But based solely on the information provided, there's no clear indication of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events align with normal Windows Update activity (svchost.exe creating files in SoftwareDistribution\/Download\/Metadata, registry changes during updates, and legitimate DLL loads).

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe is creating files in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory. That's a common place for Windows Update files, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a bunch of registry value set events from svchost.exe. A lot of registry changes could be a red flag, especially if they're all the same process. But I should check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nLooking further, there's MpSigStub.exe, which is related to Windows Defender. It's creating files in the Temp directory. Some of the file names have \"mpasdlta.vdm\" and \"mpavdlta.vdm\" â€“ those might be legitimate update files, but I need to be careful. However, the presence of multiple file creations and a pipe event might be normal during updates.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. The files like ie_to_edge_stub.exe, cookie_exporter.exe, and elevated_tracing_service.exe â€“ some of these names sound like they could be part of a legitimate Edge installation or update. However, the fact that setup.exe is creating these files might be okay if it's part of a known software installation. But I should check if there's any indication of unauthorized installation or if these files are in unexpected locations.\n\nWait, the first event mentions a file path that ends with \"de277232b2dba0a822b0b11fcd92b003058912cc\" which looks like a hash or random string. That might be a downloaded update package, which is normal. But then there's another file created in the same directory called \"Install\" and \"AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe\". Delta patches are common in software updates, so that might be legitimate.\n\nHowever, the repeated registry changes by svchost.exe could indicate some kind of configuration changes. If it's just normal update processes, then it's okay. But if there's a pattern of changing multiple registry values without a clear reason, that might be suspicious. Also, the presence of multiple file creations in the Temp directory by MpSigStub.exe might be part of a legitimate update process, but I should check if the files are signed and from trusted sources.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the process names. svchost.exe is a normal Windows process, but if it's doing a lot of file creation or registry changes, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, in this case, the events seem to be related to updates, which svchost.exe often handles. The setup.exe creating files in the EdgeCore directory might be part of an installation, which is normal.\n\nBut wait, the file names like \"cookie_exporter.exe\" and \"elevated_tracing_service.exe\" â€“ are these standard? I'm not entirely sure, but if they are part of a legitimate Edge update, then it's okay. However, if these files are not expected or if there's no corresponding installation process, that could be a problem.\n\nPutting it all together: the logs show activity related to Windows Update and Defender updates, which are normal. However, the high number of registry changes by svchost.exe and the creation of multiple files in Temp might be part of a legitimate process. But there's no clear indication of malicious activity here. The files created seem to be associated with updates and installations, which are expected. Therefore, this batch might not be interesting for investigation unless there's more context indicating otherwise. But I should check if the confidence level is high enough. Since all the activities are related to known processes and update mechanisms, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events relate to standard Windows Update operations (svchost.exe creating files in SoftwareDistribution\/Download, MpSigStub.exe handling Defender updates) and legitimate Edge installation files.

The first few entries show the process 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading various DLLs from Windows system directories like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These are legitimate .NET framework files, so that might be normal. But then there's a PowerShell process creating a file in the user's AppData folder, which isn't immediately suspicious. \n\nWait, but then there are multiple entries where a remote command is executed, pointing to a script called 'componente_auxiliar.ps1' located in 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario'. The command line shows that this script is being imported and Invoke-entrada_principal is called with OutputDirectory set to the user's Temp folder. Also, there's a part where a new service is created named 'objeto_ativo' with the binary path pointing to 'tarefa_logico.exe' in another directory. \n\nHmm, creating a new service and executing scripts from non-standard paths could be signs of malicious activity. The repetition of the same command lines suggests automated or scripted actions. Also, the use of 'Start-Sleep' might be to delay execution, which is sometimes used in malware to avoid detection. \n\nThe fact that the same PowerShell command is repeated multiple times might indicate that the process is being executed multiple times, possibly to maintain persistence or carry out further actions. The 'tarefa_logico.exe' is being loaded from different paths, which might be a red flag if it's not a standard system process. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating a service, executing a script from a non-standard location, and repeated commands could be indicative of a security incident. The logs show both normal system processes and suspicious activities.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a bunch of JSONL events. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the process entries. There are multiple entries where the command_line is using PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". Then it starts that service. That seems suspicious because creating a new service and starting it via PowerShell isn't typical for normal operations. Usually, services are set up during installation, not dynamically created at runtime. Also, the path mentioned is in a directory that has names like \"unidade_logico\" and \"registro_comum\" which might be Portuguese for \"logical unit\" and \"common record\", but that's just the naming. The fact that the service is being created and started repeatedly (multiple entries with the same command) could indicate an attempt to persist or execute malicious code.\n\nThen there are several entries where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path is \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\". This script is being executed multiple times. Executing remote commands, especially via PowerShell scripts, is a common tactic in attacks. The repetition here might indicate that the script is being used to perform actions on the system, possibly downloading more malware, establishing a backdoor, or exfiltrating data.\n\nThe winlog task entries include \"Provider Lifecycle\", \"Engine Lifecycle\", and \"Logon\". The \"Logon\" entry with the process \"services.exe\" might be normal, but the others are more concerning. The fact that the same PowerShell command is repeated multiple times across different tasks suggests a coordinated effort. Also, the combination of creating a service and executing remote commands could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nNow, looking for red flags. The use of PowerShell for creating services and executing remote scripts is a known method for attackers. The repetition of the same command in multiple logs indicates that this isn't a one-off event. The presence of both service creation and remote command execution points to possible persistence mechanisms and command and control communication. The filenames like \"tarefa_logico.exe\" and \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\" don't immediately ring any bells as standard system files, which adds to the suspicion.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any possibility of false positives. Maybe these are part of a legitimate software deployment? But the repetition and the specific actions (creating a service, executing remote commands) don't seem typical for standard operations. Also, the paths mentioned are in non-standard directories, which is another red flag.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch of events shows multiple attempts to create a service and execute a PowerShell script remotely. This behavior is consistent with malicious activity. The confidence level is high because the combination of these events is indicative of an attack, even though there's no direct evidence of malware. The classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show PowerShell creating a suspicious service (objeto_ativo) with a non-standard binary path and repeatedly executing a remote PowerShell script (componente_auxiliar.ps1), indicating potential malicious persistence and remote command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are a bunch of entries here. Let me start by scanning through them.\n\nFirst, I notice that almost all the entries have the same structure. The \"process\" is \"None\", the \"winlog\" task is \"Execute a Remote Command\", and the file path is always 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. There are 20 entries like this, except for one line where the winlog task is \"Windows Update Agent\" and the file is \"None\".\n\nHmm, so the repetition of the same file path and task multiple times might be significant. Typically, if a script is being executed remotely multiple times, especially from the same path, that could indicate something suspicious. PowerShell scripts (.ps1 files) are often used in attacks, especially if they're being executed remotely without proper authorization.\n\nBut wait, there's also that one entry about Windows Update Agent. That might be a legitimate process, but since it's only one occurrence and the rest are all the same, maybe it's just noise. The key here is the repeated execution of the same script. If this is part of normal operations, you'd expect some variation in the files or tasks. However, the repetition here could point to a potential security incident, like a malicious script being executed multiple times, possibly as part of a persistence mechanism or data exfiltration.\n\nAlso, the fact that the process is \"None\" might mean that the event wasn't logged with a specific process, which could be a red flag. Maybe the logs are incomplete, or the process is obfuscated. Either way, the repetition of the same event multiple times without any variation is concerning. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe this is a misconfiguration or a false positive. But given that it's the same script path and task, and the high number of repetitions, I lean towards this being interesting for investigation.
