The first one is about 'whoami.exe' being created, which is a legitimate Windows process that displays the current user's identity. The second entry is about 'powershell.exe' being accessed. Both processes are common in Windows environments.\n\nHmm, but wait. The first event's command line is \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\", which is the correct path. The second one just mentions 'powershell.exe' without a specific command line. But both processes are standard and often used in normal operations. \n\nHowever, the user is asking if the batch is interesting. I need to check for any signs of malicious activity. Whoami.exe alone isn't suspicious, but if it's being used in a way that's out of context, maybe. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate scripts, but sometimes abused by malware. But with just these two events, there's no clear indication of a threat. No unusual command lines, no unexpected parent processes, no network activity mentioned. \n\nSo, the classification here would be NOT INTERESTING because the events don't show any signs of malicious behavior. The confidence is medium to high since the processes are normal and there's no additional context pointing to a threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve standard Windows processes (whoami.exe and powershell.exe) with no suspicious command-line arguments or anomalous behavior detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the JSON entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a cmd.exe process creating a scheduled task with the command line that includes powershell.exe -ep bypass and a script path. The script name is \"c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\", which might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to disguise the script's name or it's a typo. Also, using \"-ep bypass\" in PowerShell is often used to bypass execution policies, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nThen there's another event with schtasks.exe creating a scheduled task again, this time with \"c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Again, the \"NonExistingScript\" part is suspicious. Scheduled tasks running daily under the system account could be a sign of persistence. Also, the task name \"win32times\" doesn't seem standard. Normal scheduled tasks usually have more descriptive names.\n\nOther events involve svchost.exe and chrome.exe with registry changes, but those might be normal unless there's a pattern. However, the repeated registry value sets from svchost.exe could indicate something, but not as immediately suspicious as the scheduled tasks. The FileCreated events for winlogbeat and some text files might be benign, like configuration files being written, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe key points here are the creation of scheduled tasks with PowerShell scripts that have non-existent filenames, using bypass execution policies, and the task names. These are indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some events might be normal, the combination of these specific events points towards an attempt to establish persistence on the system. The confidence is high because the use of schtasks with PowerShell and bypassing execution policies are well-known attack vectors. However, there's a slight chance that the scripts could be legitimate if the filenames are typos or misnamed, but the overall pattern is concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple scheduled task creations with PowerShell scripts using '-ep bypass' (bypass execution policy) and non-existent script paths (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), indicating potential persistence mechanism attempts. Schtasks.exe and cmd.exe activity with system-level task configuration raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
