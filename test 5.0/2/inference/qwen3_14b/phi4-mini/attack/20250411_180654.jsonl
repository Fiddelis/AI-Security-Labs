{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first two entries: both are about PowerShell creating and then deleting a temporary script file. That's common in some legitimate scenarios, but maybe not always. Then there's a pipe created event, which could be normal, but not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the fourth event, there's a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the TEMP directory. That script name sounds suspicious. Keystroke logging is often associated with malware trying to capture sensitive information. Also, the same script is mentioned again in another event, but with a different path. The fact that it's being executed multiple times might be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is the execution of PowerShell scripts in the Temp folder, which is a common tactic for malware to avoid detection. The presence of multiple file creations and deletions in temporary directories could indicate an attempt to hide activities. Also, the 'Execute a Remote Command' event might suggest that the system is being controlled remotely, which is a big red flag.\n\nThe other events involve svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files. Svchost is a normal system process, but creating files in system directories might be suspicious. However, the winlogbeat event seems related to a legitimate tool, so maybe not malicious here.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell executions running keystroke logging scripts, temporary files being created and deleted, and remote command execution. These are all signs of potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these specific behaviors points towards a possible security threat. So the classification should be interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions involving keystroke logging scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), temporary file creation\/deletion, and suspicious remote command execution patterns indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome doing registry changes could be normal, but repeated entries might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe just part of normal operations.\n\nNext, there's a whoami.exe process. That's a standard command to get user info. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNow, looking at the powershell.exe entries with command lines. There's one that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saves to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That script name sounds like it's capturing keystrokes, which is a red flag. Keylogging is typically malicious. The path mentioned is in the temp directory, which is common for malware to store logs.\n\nThen there are several Image Load events for PowerShell loading .dll files. Some of them are .NET framework DLLs, which is normal. However, the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be a sign that something is trying to bypass the antivirus, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, there are multiple instances of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 being executed from different paths. This repetition could indicate that the attacker is trying to ensure the script runs, maybe after some initial compromise. The fact that it's saving keystrokes to the temp directory suggests data exfiltration.\n\nAlso, the PowerShell process accessing other processes and registry changes might be part of persistence mechanisms. The combination of creating files, registry modifications, and keystroke logging points towards a possible malware infection or insider threat.\n\nI need to check if all these events are part of normal user activity. But the presence of keystroke logging scripts is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Even if some parts are normal (like Chrome's registry changes), the keylogging is a clear sign. Therefore, this batch should be classified as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in $env:TEMP, indicating potential keystroke logging (malicious behavior).
