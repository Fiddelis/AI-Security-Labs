Then there are a few entries from chrome.exe related to registry value sets.\n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe – I'm not too familiar with that process. Maybe it's a legitimate part of Office? But creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles folder... That seems odd. Usually, Office might have some resources, but creating so many files with different hashes (the min_... parts) could be a sign of something malicious. Also, the repetition of the same file paths being created multiple times might indicate an attempt to overwrite or install something.\n\nThen there's the chrome.exe entries.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each log entry and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a process called SDXHelper.exe creating a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The file name is officeaicopilot-strings.min with a long hash. Then, there are several more entries where SDXHelper.exe creates similar files with different hashes. There are duplicates, like the same file being created twice. Then there's a chrome.exe loading BitsProxy.dll, which is a legitimate Windows DLL, so that might be normal. Also, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is the main process here. I need to check if that's a legitimate process. Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages might be part of Office 365 or some add-ins. However, the repeated creation of JavaScript files with different hashes in the OfflineFiles subdirectory could be suspicious. Typically, such files might be part of an application's resources, but the fact that there are so many of them and they're all minified JavaScript might indicate something. \n\nWait, but the names include officeaicopilot-strings.min, which might relate to the Microsoft Copilot feature. However, the number of files created seems high. Also, the same file being created twice (like the one with hash 0d1ad4f1e67587dbd451127cb72e2305.js) could be a sign of duplication or maybe an error. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother point is the process winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, but creating a new configuration file might be part of setup. However, if this is unexpected, it could be something else. But there's only one event here, so maybe it's normal.\n\nThe main concern is the multiple FileCreate events by SDXHelper.exe. If this is part of a legitimate Office installation or update, it might be okay. However, if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, or if these files are being created in an unusual location, that's a red flag. \n\nBut looking at the paths, they are within the Microsoft Office directory structure, which is a common place for such resources. The fact that the files are named as minified JavaScript could be part of a legitimate application's resources, especially if they're related to Copilot. However, the sheer number of files and the repetition might be unusual. \n\nI should also check if there are any other suspicious activities. The chrome.exe loading BitsProxy.dll is normal, as that's part of the Background Intelligent Transfer Service. No signs of malware there. \n\nSo, the key points are: multiple FileCreate events by SDXHelper.exe in a legitimate-looking path, but with many files. The confidence here is moderate. It's not clearly malicious, but there's enough to warrant further investigation. Hence, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, all indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created several JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The first thing I notice is that all the files have names that start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a long hash. \n\nHmm, the process involved is SDXHelper.exe. I know that SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to Click-to-Run installations. Its role is to handle the deployment and management of Office solutions. However, the fact that it's creating so many JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory might be a red flag. \n\nWait, but why so many files? Each entry is a separate file creation event. The hashes in the filenames are unique, which could be normal if they're different versions of the same file. But I should check if this is typical behavior. Normally, SDXHelper might create files as part of updating or installing Office components, but creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles folder might be unusual. \n\nAlso, looking at the path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. That's a standard location for Office solutions, but the presence of so many files in the OfflineFiles directory could indicate either a legitimate update or something else. However, the filenames are all JavaScript files, which are typically used for client-side scripting. If these are part of a legitimate Office update, they might be necessary, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nAnother point is the repetition of some files. For example, the file with hash \"70e3fb050422d57503bf92969ce97c6d.js\" appears twice. Similarly, \"80edfe3cf51dd2aab621523006adfcaa.js\" and \"94649010c84dbf22dae304c33369015e.js\" are also duplicated. This might be a sign of redundancy or possible malicious activity, like attempting to overwrite or install multiple instances of the same file. \n\nBut I need to consider if this is normal. Sometimes, during installation or updates, multiple files might be created as part of the process. However, the sheer number of files here (over 15 entries) seems high. Also, the fact that all these files are JavaScript might be a concern because Office typically uses other file types for its components. \n\nAnother angle: the SDXHelper.exe process is known, but if it's creating a lot of files in a user's AppData directory, that's a place where malware might hide. However, without additional context like other suspicious activities (e.g., network connections, registry changes), it's hard to be certain. \n\nThe justification for classification would depend on whether this is outside the norm. Since the user hasn't provided any prior context about the system's usual behavior, but based on standard practices, creating numerous JavaScript files in that directory might be unusual. However, I should also consider that it could be a legitimate update. \n\nGiven that the files are all related to \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\", which might be part of a legitimate Office feature (like AI Copilot), but the high number of files and the repetition could still be suspicious. However, without more data, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nI think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because the volume of files created by a known process in a specific directory might indicate an anomaly.

However, if it's part of normal operations, like updating settings or add-ins, it might not be malicious. But combined with the file creations by SDXHelper.exe, which is not a standard Microsoft process, that's a red flag. SDXHelper.exe could be part of a malicious package or an add-in that's being installed.\n\nThe file paths mention SolutionPackages and PackageResources, which are typically used by Office when deploying add-ins.

Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: EXCEL.EXE is loading system DLLs like urlmon.dll and coml2.dll. That seems normal because Excel might need those for its operations. Then there's a file created in the Downloads folder named ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. The tilde and dollar sign in the filename suggest it's a temporary file or a backup, maybe from Excel itself. Not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nNext, there are several events from svchost.exe with registry value sets. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, so registry changes here could be normal, but multiple events might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen, SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. These files look like they're part of Office add-ins or solutions. The filenames include language codes and UI strings, which might be legitimate resources. But if these files are being created in unusual locations or with unusual names, that could be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, EXCEL.EXE is creating a file stream with a Zone.Identifier, which is typically used by Windows to mark files as coming from a different zone (like the internet). This might be part of normal file handling, but if there's a lot of such activity, it could indicate malicious activity, like downloading files from untrusted sources.\n\nThere's also a file created in the Recent folder with a .LNK shortcut. Shortcuts can be used to execute malicious code if they're crafted improperly. However, the presence of a .LNK file alone isn't necessarily bad unless it's pointing to something suspicious.\n\nThe HxTsr.exe process is modifying the registry. HxTsr is associated with some software, but I'm not sure if it's legitimate here. If this process is not expected on the system, that could be an issue.\n\nNow, looking at the overall pattern: most events seem to be related to normal Excel operations, Office add-ins, and standard system processes. However, the repeated registry changes by EXCEL.EXE might be unusual. Excel typically doesn't modify the registry much, so that could be a sign of something wrong. Also, the creation of temporary files and Zone.Identifier streams might be part of a larger pattern of malicious activity, like downloading and executing payloads.\n\nBut wait, the confidence here is tricky. The events don't show clear signs of malware, like unexpected processes, unusual network activity, or access to sensitive files. The majority of the events are related to legitimate processes and normal operations. However, the combination of multiple registry modifications by Excel and the creation of temporary files might warrant further investigation. \n\nI think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because there are some anomalies that could indicate a potential threat, but there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious activity.

It's usually involved in handling add-ins or solutions. But creating so many files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory might be unusual. Typically, Office might generate some temporary files, but the sheer number here could indicate something else. Also, the fact that there are duplicates might be a red flag. Maybe the process is trying to inject malicious code by creating numerous files, but I need to check if this is a known benign behavior.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're all under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. That's a legitimate location for Office solutions, but the filenames have \"ui-strings-json\" which sounds like user interface strings. However, the hash part of the filename is a bit concerning. If these files are part of a legitimate package, they might have more predictable names. The repetition of the same filenames could suggest an attempt to overwrite or replace existing files, which isn't normal.\n\nAnother point is that all the events are from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. If this process is compromised, it could be creating these files as part of a malicious payload. But I should also consider if this is part of a legitimate Office update or installation.

Typically, Office might store some resources, but creating a bunch of JS files with hashes in the PackageResources might be suspicious. Especially if they're not part of a known legitimate package.\n\nThen there are events related to chrome.exe. Chrome is creating a file in the Downloads folder called Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. Then there's a Zone.Identifier stream, which is usually created when a file is downloaded from the internet. That's normal. But then there are multiple FileCreateStreamHash events for the same Excel file. Also, a DNS query from chrome.exe. That's typical for browsing, but maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen, looking at the EXCEL.EXE process. It's opening the downloaded Excel file. Then, image loaded events for mscoreei.dll, mscoree.dll, and amsi.dll. Those are legitimate system DLLs used by .NET and anti-malware. But if there's an unusual number of image loads or if they're from unexpected locations, that could be a red flag. However, in this case, the paths are standard Windows system directories, so that's probably normal.\n\nAnother thing is the winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a new config file might be part of an update or configuration change. But if that's unexpected, it could be something else. However, the event just says \"File created\" without any indication of malicious activity.\n\nNow, looking at the SDXHelper.exe events again. The fact that it's creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office directory, and the filenames have hashes, which might be obfuscation. Also, the directory path is under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. SolutionPackages are part of Office add-ins, but creating files there might be part of a legitimate process.

The SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JS files in the Office directory. The Chrome events are normal, and the Excel events are also normal. Unless there's something else. But the JS files could be part of a malicious payload. However, without more context, like the content of the files or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say.

However, the repeated creation of these files might be a red flag.\n\nWait, but why are there multiple entries for the same file? Like, the mk-mk-ui-strings-json file is listed twice. That could be a duplication, which might indicate an error or maybe an attempt to overwrite. However, it's possible that the logging system just captured the same event twice. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother point is the process name. SDXHelper.exe is legitimate, but if it's creating a lot of files in non-standard locations, that could be suspicious. However, the paths here are within the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office directory, which is a common place for Office-related files. So maybe that's normal.\n\nBut then there's the registry event from EXCEL.EXE. Setting a registry value might be normal too, but combined with the multiple file creations, it might be part of a larger action. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nI should check if the files being created are expected. The names suggest they are UI string files for different languages. That makes sense if the user is installing a multilingual add-in or solution. However, if the user didn't initiate this, it could be malicious. But since the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Office, it's more likely to be legitimate.\n\nBut wait, the confidence level. If all these events are part of a legitimate Office operation, then it's not interesting. However, if the files are being created in a way that's not typical, or if there's a pattern that suggests data exfiltration or malicious code, then it would be interesting. However, the files here are just string files, which are usually benign.\n\nAnother angle: the use of SolutionPackages might be related to deploying Office add-ins. If the user is an administrator or if these packages are being deployed without consent, that could be a concern. But the logs don't indicate any malicious activity beyond the file creations.\n\nSo, considering all this, the events might be part of a legitimate Office operation, even though there are multiple file creations. However, the repetition of the same file and the number of files created might be worth investigating further. But without more context, like the user's actions or other suspicious events, it's hard to classify this as definitely malicious. Therefore, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence because the behavior is unusual but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory with localized UI string filenames. While SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate Office process, the repetitive creation of language-specific resource files in non-standard subdirectories may indicate unusual behavior or potential tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
