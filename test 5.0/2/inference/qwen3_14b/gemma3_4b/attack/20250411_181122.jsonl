The first event has a PowerShell command that uses findstr and select-string to search for 'password' in various file types. That seems like someone is trying to find passwords in files. That's a red flag. But wait, maybe it's a legitimate search? However, the command is a bit complex and uses a lot of wildcards, which could be part of a brute-force search or data exfiltration.\n\nThen there's a file created by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. The file path is in the Downloads directory, which isn't too suspicious on its own. But the presence of winlogbeat might be normal if the system is being monitored. Not sure yet.\n\nOther processes like notepad, calc, and svchost are common, but the repeated Registry value set events might indicate some configuration changes.

That's a common technique used in attacks to find sensitive information. Also, the same command appears multiple times in different events.

It's possible that this is part of a larger attack, like a data extraction attempt.\n\nAnother thing is the use of 'select-string' with -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue, which might be to avoid triggering alerts. The fact that it's searching across multiple file types in directories suggests a broad search, which is suspicious.\n\nEven though there are other events, the combination of the PowerShell command and the repeated attempts to search for passwords makes this batch interesting.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's part of the Winlogbeat tool, which is used for collecting Windows logs. Maybe that's normal, but then there's also powershell.exe creating a file called estrutura_ativo.txt. Not sure yet, but maybe that's just a regular file.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being used. The command lines for cmd.exe include schtasks commands to delete scheduled tasks. That's interesting because deleting scheduled tasks could be part of a cleanup after an attack. Also, there's a whoami.exe command, which is usually used to get the current user's identity. Not inherently bad, but combined with other actions, it might be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there are several entries about ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. The registry changes might indicate that something is modifying system settings. The use of schtasks.exe to delete tasks could be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity. Also, there's a cmd.exe command that uses wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That seems odd because why would someone delete notepad.exe? Maybe it's a red herring or part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother point is the repetition of certain processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe being accessed multiple times. High frequency of such events might indicate automated scripts or malicious activities. The presence of both ProcessCreate and ProcessAccess events could suggest that processes are being created and then accessed, which might be normal, but combined with registry changes and task deletions, it's more suspicious.\n\nI also notice that some of the commands are using redirection to suppress output, which is common in attacks to avoid leaving logs. For example, the cmd.exe command ends with >nul 2>&1, which hides the output. That's a common tactic used by attackers.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malware or data exfiltration here. The logs don't show any network activity or file downloads from suspicious sources. It's more about process manipulation and registry changes. But considering all these factors together, it's possible that this is part of a larger attack, like establishing persistence or covering tracks.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the combination of deleting scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and using commands to suppress output might indicate suspicious behavior.

So, first, looking through the events. There's a lot of entries with chrome.exe doing various things. The tasks include Registry value set, Dns queries, Network connections, and some Image loaded events.\n\nHmm, the first thing that stands out is that chrome.exe is making a lot of registry changes. Normally, Chrome might modify the registry for its own settings, but repeated changes could be suspicious. However, if it's just normal operation, maybe not. But then there's also the Image loaded events. One of them is amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. If Chrome is loading that, maybe it's interacting with Defender, but that's not necessarily bad. The other is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender Platform. Again, that's part of the system's security features. So maybe that's normal.\n\nThen there's a file created by powershell.exe named objeto_logico.txt. That's a regular text file, so maybe just a user creating a file. Not necessarily malicious. But then there's also a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The path is in the Downloads folder, which might be normal if they're setting up monitoring. But the .yml.new file suggests it's a configuration file being created. Maybe that's part of installation.\n\nNow, looking for any unusual patterns. The chrome.exe entries are numerous, but most are standard tasks. However, the fact that there are multiple registry value sets might indicate some configuration changes. But without knowing the specific keys or values, it's hard to tell. The Dns queries are also common, but again, not necessarily bad unless they're going to suspicious domains.\n\nWait, there's an entry where the process is None for a Dns query. That might mean the system is making a DNS query without a clear process, which could be a red flag. But maybe it's a system-level query. Not sure.\n\nPutting it all together: there's no obvious malicious activity here. The events seem to be a mix of normal operations, like Chrome using the registry and network, Defender components being loaded, and file creations by legitimate processes. The only slightly odd thing is the None process for DNS, but that might be a false positive or a system process. Without more context, like the actual registry keys changed or the DNS domains involved, it's hard to say. So maybe this is not interesting enough to warrant an investigation. But I'm not 100% sure. Confidence might be around 0.4, leaning towards not interesting, but not entirely certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of normal Chrome.exe operations (registry modifications, DNS queries, network connections) and benign file creations by PowerShell and Winlogbeat.

So first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe with process accessed and registry value set events. Those are common, but not necessarily malicious. Then there's WMIC.exe with a command line that deletes notepad.exe processes. That's a red flag because using WMIC to delete processes can be part of a malicious attack, like trying to remove other malware or legitimate processes to hide its presence.\n\nNext, the same WMIC.exe is loading several DLLs: urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a malicious process is loading amsi.dll, it might be trying to bypass detection by hooking into AMSI. Similarly, MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender. Loading these DLLs from unexpected locations or in unusual contexts could indicate an attempt to disable or subvert security features.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe performing registry value sets. While registry changes can be normal, the frequency here might be suspicious. Also, there's a command in cmd.exe that deletes a user account (\"net user \/del\"), which could be part of an attempt to remove a user or privilege escalation. The presence of \"net1.exe\" instead of \"net.exe\" might be a typo or a malicious replacement, but I need to check if that's a known issue.\n\nOther entries include whoami.exe, which is normal for checking user context, but combined with other activities, it might be part of information gathering. The \"User Account Management\" event could be related to the user deletion commands mentioned earlier.\n\nPutting it all together: the use of WMIC to delete processes, loading security-related DLLs, multiple registry changes, and user account deletion commands all point towards potential malicious activity.

So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe. There are several Image loaded events pointing to system files like clrjit.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate files from Microsoft, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a File created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of an attack, like dropping a payload and then cleaning up.\n\nAnother thing is the Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if it's unexpected, it might indicate something malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Also, there are multiple Process accessed events. These could be normal, but if they're accessing sensitive processes or files, that's a concern.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a PowerShell command with & {} which is just an empty block. That might be a test or a harmless script. There are also multiple instances of whoami.exe being executed, which is a standard command to check user context. But if it's being run excessively, maybe it's part of reconnaissance.\n\nThe presence of Winlogbeat is normal for log collection, but the File created event for .winlogbeat.yml.new might be part of configuration changes, which could be benign unless it's unauthorized.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the temporary file creation and deletion, and the multiple process accesses. However, many of these events could be part of normal operations or testing. Since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms, it might not be a high priority. But the temporary file actions are worth investigating further. So, I'd classify this as interesting but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events include temporary file creation\/deletion and process access attempts, which may indicate testing or malicious activity.

But the process is \"None\" and file is \"None\". Hmm, maybe those are just normal system events? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's an entry with \"cmd.exe\" running a command to delete a user, \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\", using the \"net user\" command with \/del \/domain. That seems suspicious. Deleting a user account might be part of an attack, especially if it's done without authorization. Also, the command_line is detailed here, which is a red flag.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of \"powershell.exe\" and \"cmd.exe\" executing commands related to registry changes and process access. For example, \"sc delete win32times\" is a command to delete a service. That could be part of disabling a system service to avoid detection. Also, the use of \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" events might indicate someone is trying to modify system settings or escalate privileges.\n\nLooking further, there's a \"net1.exe\" which is a suspicious name. The real \"net.exe\" is a standard Windows tool, but \"net1.exe\" might be a typo or a malicious binary masquerading as a legitimate one. The command here is also deleting another user account, \"tarefa_padrao_Admin\". Multiple user deletions could be part of an attack to remove other users or clean up after themselves.\n\nThe repeated use of \"whoami.exe\" might be checking the current user's privileges, which is common in attacks to confirm they have admin rights. Also, \"conhost.exe\" is a legitimate process, but if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, that might be a sign of something else.\n\nThere are several \"Registry value set\" events, which could indicate changes to system configurations, maybe to hide the attack or modify system behavior. The fact that multiple processes are accessing and modifying the registry might be part of a broader attack strategy.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple user deletions, attempts to delete system services, registry modifications, and the use of command-line tools to perform these actions. These activities are indicative of a potential security breach, such as an attacker trying to remove evidence, disable security services, or take control of the system.

The use of double percent signs might be an attempt to obfuscate the path. Also, the presence of 'calc.exe' in the filenames could be a red herring, but maybe part of a payload.\n\nMultiple process accesses and registry changes by PowerShell and CMD could indicate someone trying to manipulate the system. The fact that there are several image loads from .NET assemblies might be part of a legitimate script, but combined with the file deletions and registry changes, it's a bit concerning.\n\nI need to check if there's a pattern here. The repeated use of PowerShell and CMD, registry modifications, file deletions, and loading of .NET DLLs.

Then there's 'whoami.exe' being executed, which is usually a benign command to check user identity. \n\nNext, I see 'RuntimeBroker.exe' and 'notepad.exe' modifying registry values. That might be normal, but I should check if there's any suspicious pattern. Then, 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll' from the System32 directory. Wait, 'urlmon.dll' is a legitimate Windows DLL, so that might not be an issue. \n\nThere's a 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file could be normal. However, the filename has a .new extension, which sometimes indicates a temporary file, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking for other red flags: repeated 'Process accessed' events for powershell.exe might indicate someone is trying to execute scripts or commands through PowerShell. But without more context, like command-line arguments or unusual paths, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe 'Network connection detected' events for chrome.exe are probably just normal browsing activity. The DNS queries are also common. \n\nHowever, the combination of multiple PowerShell accesses and registry changes might be worth investigating.
