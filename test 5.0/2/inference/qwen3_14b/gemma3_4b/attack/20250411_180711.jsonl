But then PowerShell is involved multiple times. The command line in one of the PowerShell events stands out. It has a script that's encrypting some text using XOR with a key and then sending it to example.com. That seems suspicious because encrypting data and sending it to an external server could be part of exfiltrating information. \n\nAlso, there are several 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell.exe, which include various .dll files. Some of these are part of the .NET framework, which is normal, but the presence of multiple image loads might be normal for PowerShell scripts. However, the fact that it's loading clrjit.dll and others might be part of running .NET code, which isn't inherently bad, but combined with the encrypted data being sent out, it raises a flag.\n\nThen there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to leave no traces. The file name has a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting it quickly could be an attempt to execute a script without leaving evidence.\n\nPutting this all together: normal browser activity, but the PowerShell events with the encryption script, the image loads, and the temporary file creation\/deletion suggest potential malicious activity.

Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple PowerShell.exe processes. The first event has a command line that looks suspicious. It's using XOR encryption on a string that includes \"Path\\n----\\nC:\\Users\\victim\", which might be trying to obfuscate data being sent to example.com. That's a red flag because encrypting data before sending it could be exfiltrating sensitive info. The key used is a static string, which is common in simple obfuscation techniques. The use of Invoke-WebRequest to POST the encrypted data is another point of concern.\n\nThen, there's an event where PowerShell loads urlmon.dll. That's a normal system file, so maybe not harmful, but combined with other events, it might be part of something else. Another event shows a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. Maybe the attacker is trying to tamper with logs or install something. However, the file path seems like a temporary one, so maybe it's just a normal operation.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are several registry value sets and process accesses. Multiple PowerShell.exe entries accessing the registry or other processes could indicate persistence mechanisms or attempts to modify system settings. The presence of conhost.exe and other system processes might be normal, but the frequency of PowerShell activities is notable.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any clear malicious activity. The key part here is the first event with the PowerShell command that encrypts data and sends it to example.com. That's a strong indicator of data exfiltration. Even though some other events are normal, the combination of obfuscated data exfiltration via PowerShell and multiple registry changes might suggest a malicious actor trying to establish persistence and exfiltrate data.\n\nBut wait, the confidence level. The encryption and POST to example.com are strong signs, but without knowing the actual data being sent, it's a bit uncertain.

First, looking at the processes involved. There's svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. Some of these are normal system processes, like svchost and chrome. But powershell.exe being used multiple times might be a red flag, especially if it's doing things like registry modifications or process access.\n\nWait, there's a lot of Registry value set events. That's common in some legitimate scenarios, but if it's happening a lot, especially from different processes, it could be suspicious. Also, looking at the file paths. One entry mentions amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. But another entry has a file path in ProgramData for Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. That might be normal, but the presence of multiple registry changes and process accesses could indicate something's up.\n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of a legitimate setup. But the user might be collecting logs, which isn't necessarily bad. However, the combination of multiple powershell.exe activities, including a command that removes a file with a long path, might be part of a cleanup or attack.\n\nLooking at the command line for one powershell instance: it's removing a file named \"pacote_padrao_script.bat\" with a path that seems a bit convoluted. The use of \"Remove-Item\" with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore could be trying to delete a script without leaving traces. That's suspicious. Also, the fact that there are multiple ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe might indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated, which is not typical in normal operations.\n\nAnother thing is that chrome.exe is involved in multiple registry changes. Chrome itself might modify the registry for updates or settings, but the frequency here might be high. However, combined with other suspicious activities, it adds up.\n\nThe presence of ImageLoad events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll could be normal, but if those are being loaded in unexpected contexts, it might be a sign of something malicious. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious files being loaded.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry modifications, frequent process access events, a suspicious file deletion command in powershell, and the involvement of winlogbeat (which could be part of a legitimate log collection but might also be used in attacks).

The command_line for some is just 'powershell.exe & {}', which might be a placeholder or a script that's not doing much. However, repeated events could indicate something automated or a script running multiple times.\n\nThere's also a File created event for a PowerShell startup profile, which could be normal, but maybe not. The Registry value set events might be part of normal operations, but if they're modifying key settings, that could be suspicious. The whoami.exe executions are standard for checking user context, so probably benign.\n\nThe cmd.exe events include a delete command in the Temp directory, which might be cleaning up after itself.

The files mentioned are like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others from the .NET Framework. Those are legitimate system files, so loading them might be normal. But then there's a file created in the Downloads folder called estrutura_temporario.txt. That's a temporary file, maybe part of normal operations, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several events where Chrome.exe is setting registry values. A lot of them—like 8 entries. That seems unusual. Why would Chrome be changing the registry so many times? Maybe it's part of an exploit or trying to modify system settings. But I should check if that's normal behavior. Chrome might update registry settings during normal operation, but 8 times in a row? Maybe that's a red flag.\n\nNext, PowerShell is creating a file in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest... Then immediately deleting it. That could be part of a script testing or policy check, but the deletion might be to hide evidence. Also, the command lines show Remove-Item commands with paths that have ..\\ which might be navigating up directories. That could be a way to delete files in parent directories, which might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines, the paths have a pattern: they're removing .bat files in various directories. The use of -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore suggests that the script is trying to delete files without prompting errors. That might be part of a cleanup, but if those files are not supposed to be there, it could be malicious.\n\nAlso, the fact that PowerShell is loading several .dll files from the .NET Framework and then performing file operations might indicate that someone is using PowerShell for tasks that are not typical. But some of those DLLs are part of the .NET runtime, so they are legitimate.\n\nHowever, the combination of multiple registry changes by Chrome and the file creation\/deletion by PowerShell could be signs of something malicious. The registry changes might be modifying settings to persist or enable certain behaviors, while the file operations could be part of an attack chain.\n\nBut I need to be careful. Some of these events might be normal. For example, Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll is loaded, which is a legitimate file. The temporary file creation and deletion might be part of a script that's allowed. However, the multiple registry events from Chrome and the repeated Remove-Item commands with the ..\\ could be suspicious.\n\nConsidering all that, the batch has a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities.

Also, the paths mentioned like \"C:\\\\componente_principal\\\\pacote_comum\\\\..\\\\elemento_temporario\\\\tarefa_padrao_script.bat\" – the \"..\\\\\" part might be an attempt to navigate up the directory tree. That's a red flag for malicious activity, like trying to remove files in a way that's not straightforward.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe being used to stop and delete services with sc.exe commands. Stopping and deleting services can be part of a persistence or evasion technique. The commands are \"sc.exe stop objeto_temporario\" and \"sc.exe delete estrutura_secundario\". If these services are legitimate, it might be normal, but if they're not, it could be an attempt to remove malicious services or prevent them from running. However, without knowing what the services are named, it's hard to say, but the fact that they're being deleted could be suspicious.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe command, which is usually benign, just shows the current user. But combined with other activities, it might be part of a larger attack, like checking user privileges before proceeding with more actions.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are events related to registry changes, process creation, and file creation. The registry value sets and process accesses could indicate changes to system configurations or attempts to inject code. The FileCreated event points to a PowerShell startup profile, which might be normal, but if it's being modified, that's a concern.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell commands trying to remove files with Force and ErrorAction Ignore suggests that the attacker is trying to ensure the files are deleted even if there are errors, which is a common tactic in malware to clean up after itself.\n\nHowever, there are also some normal processes like services.exe and conhost.exe, which are part of the Windows operating system. But the combination of these with the suspicious PowerShell and cmd activities might indicate a larger attack.\n\nI need to check if there's a pattern here.

That path seems a bit off. StartupProfileData is usually related to PowerShell profiles, but the 'NonInteractive' part might be a clue.

The first event mentions a file created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\tarefa_comum.txt'. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a user downloading something. But then there's a recurring command line: 'Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore'. This command is trying to delete a file named key.log in the TEMP directory, and it's using -ErrorAction Ignore to suppress any errors if the file doesn't exist. That's a bit suspicious because why would someone try to delete a file that might not even be there? Maybe they're trying to clean up after themselves, which is common in malicious activities.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with the task 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. Those might be related to the PowerShell provider or engine, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the repetition of the same command line several times could indicate an automated process or script that's running multiple times, which is a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET Framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. Loading these DLLs is normal for PowerShell when running .NET code, but when combined with the other events, it might be part of a larger script or payload. However, there's also a mention of 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender, which is part of the antivirus software. That might be a legitimate process, but it's worth checking if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nAnother point is the 'File Delete logged' event for the temporary script file '__PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1'.
