{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is svchost.exe creating a file in the System32\\sru directory. SRUtmp.log is a temporary file related to the System Resource Usage (SRU) feature in Windows, which is part of the system's normal operations. So that might be legitimate.\n\nThe second event is winlogbeat.exe creating a new YAML file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so it's possible that this is part of its normal operation when setting up configurations. The file name includes .new, which suggests it's a temporary file during configuration updates. That seems okay too.\n\nNext, there's a registry value set by powershell.exe. PowerShell is a common tool, and modifying registry values isn't inherently malicious, but it depends on the context. However, there's no specific indication of malicious activity here.\n\nThe fourth event is a process access by powershell.exe. Again, PowerShell accessing processes is normal, but without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nLooking at all events together, none of them seem to indicate a security threat. The files created are in expected locations for their respective processes, and the actions taken (like registry changes) are not flagged as suspicious. There's no unusual combination of events that would suggest a compromise. So, I'd classify this as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate system processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) performing normal operations (file creation, registry modification, process access) in expected locations. No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through each entry to spot any suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe and chrome.exe doing DNS queries. That's normal, as browsers and system services often perform DNS lookups. Then there's MpDefenderCoreService.exe making network connections. That's part of Windows Defender, so probably legitimate.\n\nBut then I see multiple instances of chrome.exe making network connections. While Chrome might connect to various sites, the repetition might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe process created, which is a standard command to check user identity. But then there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that adds a domain user and adds someone to the Domain Admins group. The command line has \"net user\" and \"net group\" commands with domain admin privileges. That's highly suspicious because adding users to Domain Admins is a critical action that should be closely monitored. The usernames and passwords here look like they could be temporary or test accounts, but the fact that this is happening via cmd.exe might indicate someone is trying to manipulate the domain structure.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of net.exe and net1.exe being used to add users and groups. These commands are part of the Windows net utility, which is used for network administration. However, using these commands in a script or interactively without proper authorization is a security risk. The presence of these commands in the process create events suggests someone is trying to modify the domain's user and group structure, which is a clear indicator of potential malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there's a file creation event for winlogbeat.yml.new, which is related to Winlogbeat, a log shipper. But the other file created is pacote_base.txt, which might be a log or data file. However, the svchost.exe creating SRUtmp.log is normal as part of the System Resource Usage tracking.\n\nThe key points here are the multiple process creations involving adding domain users and administrators. These actions are typically done by administrators, but if they're being done without proper authorization or as part of a script, it could be a sign of compromise. The use of cmd.exe and net.exe to perform these actions is more concerning than using PowerShell, which is more common for such tasks. However, the presence of multiple such events in a short period could indicate automated or malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch includes several events that involve modifying domain user and group structures, which is a significant security concern. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events points towards potential malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin users via 'net' commands, repeated network connections from chrome.exe, and registry modifications. These patterns suggest potential lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
