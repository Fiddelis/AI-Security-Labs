Let's go through each line.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, maybe part of installation. Not suspicious yet.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe created 'entrada_ativo.txt'. PowerShell is common, but creating a file isn't necessarily bad. Maybe just a normal script.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe accessed a process. Process access can be normal, but maybe part of something else. Not sure yet.\n\nFourth: whoami.exe was executed. That's a standard command to get user info. Probably benign.\n\nFifth: another process access by powershell. Hmm, multiple process accesses might be a red flag. But need to check if there's a pattern.\n\nWait, the first event is winlogbeat creating a config file. That's part of its normal operation. The other events involve PowerShell creating files and accessing processes. But are there any signs of malicious activity? Like unexpected file paths, unusual commands, or multiple process accesses?\n\nThe files created are in the Downloads folder, which is common for user downloads. The names don't seem suspicious. The processes are all standard. No mention of network activity, registry changes, or other suspicious actions. The confidence is low because there's no clear malicious behavior. Maybe just normal user activity. So classification would be NOT INTERESTING with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve standard processes (winlogbeat, powershell, whoami) performing typical actions (file creation, process access) in user directories.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first entry, there's a process called powershell.exe with a task 'Process accessed'. Not too suspicious on its own. But then the second entry shows cmd.exe running a command that creates a scheduled task using schtasks. The command line includes creating a task that runs powershell.exe with -ep bypass and a script path. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\", which might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to hide the real script name or it's a typo. Also, the task is set to run daily under the system account. That's a bit concerning because running scripts as system with elevated privileges could be malicious.\n\nAnother entry has schtasks.exe creating another task with a similar command, pointing to c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the \"NonExistingScript\" part is odd. Maybe the scripts are named to avoid detection, or they're placeholders. Also, the scheduled tasks are named 'win32times' which doesn't seem like a standard task name. Typically, Windows tasks have more descriptive names.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of svchost.exe and other processes modifying the registry. svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's involved in registry changes, that might be part of a larger attack. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The fact that multiple processes are accessing the registry could indicate some kind of persistence mechanism being set up.\n\nThe FileCreate events mention files being created in the System32\\Tasks directory, which is where scheduled tasks are stored. That's normal, but combined with the suspicious task creation commands, it might be part of an attack. Also, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That might be normal if they're configuring it, but the other file created by powershell.exe, 'estrutura_geral.txt', doesn't seem suspicious unless it's part of data exfiltration.\n\nHowever, the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe are a bit odd. Chrome shouldn't be modifying the registry in such a way unless it's compromised. But there are eight entries of chrome.exe doing registry value sets. That's a lot. Maybe a browser exploit leading to persistence.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of scheduled tasks with powershell.exe using bypassed execution policies and non-existent scripts, combined with multiple registry modifications and file creations in system directories, suggests potential malicious activity. The use of 'NonExistingScript' might be a clue that the actual malicious script is elsewhere, or it's a misdirection. The fact that the tasks are set to run daily under the system account is a strong indicator of persistence and potential privilege escalation.\n\nHowever, there's also normal activity like winlogbeat creating a config file and a text file. But the overall pattern of scheduled tasks and registry changes seems more indicative of an attack. The confidence is high enough to flag it as interesting, but not 100% certain without more evidence like the actual content of the scripts or network activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: scheduled tasks created with PowerShell using '-ep bypass' (indicative of potential script execution bypassing security policies), non-existent script paths referenced (c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1, c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1), and repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe and svchost.exe (potential persistence mechanisms).\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
