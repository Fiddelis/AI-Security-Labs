The use of \"..\\\\\" suggests that the script is being imported from a parent directory, which might be a red flag because it could indicate attempting to access files outside the intended directory structure, possibly for evasion.\n\nThen there's the \"New-Service\" command creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". Creating a new service and starting it could be suspicious, especially if the service is not known or expected. The repetition of these commands across multiple log entries (multiple instances of the same process and file) might indicate a persistent attempt to execute these commands, which is concerning.\n\nLooking at the file events, there are several entries where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path is \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The fact that this script is being executed remotely multiple times could be a sign of a malicious actor trying to maintain access or execute commands on the system.\n\nPutting this together, the combination of importing a module from a suspicious path, creating a new service, and repeated execution of a remote script seems like potential malicious activity.

So, first, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created in the SoftwareDistribution folder, which is related to Windows Update. That's normal, but I should check the files. There are entries like ReserveManager.dll, WinREAgent.dll, and fvereseal.dll in the Metadata subfolder. Wait, those names sound a bit off. Normally, Windows Update would handle files like .cab or .msu, but dlls in Metadata might be unusual. \n\nThen there's a file created in the Download folder named AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe. That looks like a patch file, which could be legitimate if it's part of an update. However, the presence of multiple files with similar names and the use of svchost.exe as the process might be a red flag. svchost.exe is a normal system process, but if it's creating a lot of files in unexpected locations, that's suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are several registry value set events. While registry changes can be normal, multiple entries without clear context might indicate something trying to modify settings. However, the logs don't show the specific registry keys, so it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother point is the temporary files created by MpSigStub.exe, which is related to Windows Defender. Those files are in the Temp directory and seem to be part of signature updates. That's probably normal. \n\nBut the main concern is the unusual dll files in the SoftwareDistribution Metadata folder. Those could be signs of a malicious payload being dropped during an update process. Also, the fact that svchost.exe is involved in creating these files might indicate that a malicious process is masquerading as a legitimate one. \n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these files could be part of legitimate updates. The confidence here isn't 100%, but the combination of unexpected file types in specific directories and the use of svchost.exe makes this batch worth investigating further.

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess event. Not too suspicious yet. Then there's whoami.exe being created, which is a normal command to get user info. But then there's another powershell.exe process with a command line that imports a module from a path that looks a bit odd. The path has \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The use of \"..\" suggests moving up a directory, which might be a way to obfuscate the path. Also, the command line includes Invoke-entrada_principal, which doesn't look like a standard PowerShell cmdlet. That's a red flag.\n\nNext, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET. That's normal for PowerShell, but the specific ones here might be part of something else. Then there's a FileDelete event for a temporary script file. Deleting a temp file isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be hiding something.\n\nLooking at the other processes: sppsvc.exe creating a cache file, which is normal. Svchost.exe creating several files in the SoftwareDistribution directory. That's part of Windows Update, so maybe legitimate. But the number of files created might be a bit high. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key suspicious points are the PowerShell command importing a module from a potentially obfuscated path and the use of Invoke-entrada_principal, which isn't a standard command. Also, the deletion of the temp script file could be an attempt to clean up after executing malicious code. The combination of these events suggests that someone might be using PowerShell for something malicious, possibly downloading or executing a script from a non-standard location.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any other indicators. The other events don't show obvious signs of malware, but the PowerShell activities are concerning. The confidence here would be moderate because while there are suspicious elements, they could also be part of legitimate activities. But the obfuscation in the file path and the non-standard cmdlet usage make me lean towards \"INTERESTING\" as the classification.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit suspicious behavior, including loading obfuscated modules from non-standard paths (e.g., '..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'), executing non-native commands like 'Invoke-entrada_principal', and deleting temporary script files.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple file creations by setup.exe in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. The files created are named elevated_tracing_service.exe and elevation_service.exe. That seems a bit suspicious because those are not standard names for legitimate Microsoft files. Usually, Microsoft's Edge would have more generic names, and having something like \"elevated_tracing_service\" might be an attempt to mimic legitimate processes but with a twist.\n\nThen, there's a PowerShell process creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to a .exe file in a non-standard location: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. Creating a new service with a custom executable is a red flag. Legitimate services are usually installed through proper channels and not just created on the fly by scripts.\n\nLooking further, the PowerShell process is loading several DLLs from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. While loading clr.dll or mscoreei.dll is normal for PowerShell, the presence of MpOAV.dll (which is part of Windows Defender) might be a bit unusual here. However, that's not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nAnother point is the file deletion of a temporary script file. That's common in PowerShell scripts to clean up after execution, but when combined with other activities, it could be part of an attack.\n\nThen there are several entries where the process is \"None\" and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" pointing to a script in C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. That's a strong indicator of remote code execution or lateral movement. Also, the command line in some processes shows importing a module from a non-standard path and invoking a function called Invoke-entrada_principal, which doesn't look like a standard PowerShell cmdlet. The use of $env:Temp suggests that the script is using temporary directories, which is common in malicious scripts to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThe repeated entries of the same command line and Provider Lifecycle task might indicate that the script is being executed multiple times, possibly as part of a larger attack or persistence mechanism.\n\nPutting this all together: the creation of suspicious files, the use of PowerShell to create a new service with a non-standard executable, the execution of remote commands from non-standard paths, and the use of temporary files all point towards potential malicious activity. The combination of these events is more than just a single suspicious event; it's a pattern that could be indicative of an attacker trying to establish persistence or execute code on the system.\n\nHowever, I should consider if any of these could be false positives. For example, setup.exe creating files in EdgeCore might be part of an update, but the names of the files are unusual. The PowerShell scripts could be part of a legitimate administrative task, but the paths and the specific commands (like creating a service with a custom executable) are more indicative of malicious behavior. The presence of multiple events related to the same script and the use of non-standard directories further support the idea that this is not a normal process.\n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say around 0.85. The events are not 100% conclusive, but the combination of suspicious file names, service creation, remote command execution, and the use of non-standard paths makes this a high-probability candidate for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: setup.exe creating non-standard executable files in Microsoft EdgeCore directory, PowerShell creating a new service with a custom binary path, execution of remote commands from non-standard paths, and repeated invocation of a custom module with temporary output directories.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are a bunch of events here. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, almost all the entries have the same structure. The process is \"None\", which might mean that the event doesn't have a process associated with it, or maybe it's not logged properly. The winlog field has a task called \"Execute a Remote Command\", and the file path is always \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". \n\nWait, the same file path is repeated multiple times. That's a lot of entries—like 12 times. Then there's one entry where the winlog task is \"None\" and the file is \"None\". Hmm, maybe that's an error or a different event. But the rest are all the same.\n\nNow, executing a remote command via PowerShell scripts can be suspicious. Especially if it's happening multiple times. The same script being executed repeatedly might indicate something like a persistent backdoor or a script that's being called over and over again. But I need to check if there's any other context. \n\nHowever, all the events are the same. If this is a normal operation, maybe it's a scheduled task or a legitimate script that's being run multiple times. But the fact that the process is \"None\" might be a red flag. Maybe the event logging isn't capturing the process correctly, which could be a sign of something evading detection. \n\nAlso, the file path has some non-English terms like \"unidade_logico\" which translates to \"logical unit\" in Portuguese. Maybe the system is in a Portuguese-speaking environment, but that's not necessarily suspicious. However, the repetition of the same event multiple times is concerning. \n\nBut wait, the user said to consider the entire batch. If the same event is logged 12 times, that's a lot. Even if it's legitimate, that's unusual. But without more context, like other events or process details, it's hard to tell. However, the classification is whether it's interesting for investigation. \n\nSince the same script is being executed repeatedly with the same task, and the process is missing, this could be a sign of a potential security issue. The confidence might be around 0.75 because it's not definitive, but there are enough suspicious points to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated events show the same PowerShell script being executed remotely from a suspicious path, with no associated process.

Most of them have the same structure: the process is \"None\", the winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\", and the file path is always 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. There are a few other entries with different tasks, like \"Security Group Management\" and \"Logon\" with \"services.exe\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is a security threat. The repeated execution of the same PowerShell script from the same path is a red flag. Usually, PowerShell scripts are used for legitimate tasks, but when they're executed remotely multiple times, especially from a non-standard path, it could indicate something malicious. The fact that the process is \"None\" might mean that the event is logged without a specific process, which could be due to the way the logging is set up, but it's also possible that it's evading detection.\n\nLooking at the file path, \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\" translates to \"auxiliary component\" in Portuguese. That's a bit suspicious because attackers sometimes use descriptive names that might seem benign. However, the repetition of the same file being executed multiple times in a short period could suggest a scripted attack or a worm.\n\nThen there's the entry with \"Security Group Management\" and \"Logon\" with services.exe. The latter is a legitimate system process, so that might not be an issue. But the security group management task might be part of a larger attack, like modifying permissions. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key point here is the high frequency of the same remote command execution. Even if each individual event isn't a clear threat, the pattern is concerning. In cybersecurity, repetition of the same suspicious activity is a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior. The confidence here would be high because of the volume and consistency of the events. However, there's a chance that this could be a legitimate process, but given the lack of other processes involved and the repetition, it's more likely a false flag or an actual attack.\n\nSo, I think this batch is interesting because of the repeated execution of the same PowerShell script from the same path, which is a common indicator of malicious activity. The confidence is around 0.9 because while there's a possibility of false positives, the pattern is highly suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated executions of the same PowerShell script ('componente_auxiliar.ps1') from a non-standard path, all logged under 'Execute a Remote Command' task.
