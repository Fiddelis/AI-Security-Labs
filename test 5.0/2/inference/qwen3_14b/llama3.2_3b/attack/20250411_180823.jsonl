First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: chrome.exe has a network connection, which is normal. Then powershell.exe accessing a process, maybe legitimate. The third entry is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL, so that's probably okay. \n\nBut then there's an entry for cmd.exe with a command line that uses schtasks to create scheduled tasks. The command line has some strange names like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The command line parameters look a bit odd, especially the use of calc.exe being triggered on logon and startup. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with these names might be part of a persistence mechanism. Also, the tasks are set to run as the system user, which could be a sign of someone trying to maintain access.\n\nAnother entry shows powershell.exe again with ProcessAccess, but that's not necessarily bad. Then there's a schtasks.exe entry creating another task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same pattern. The command line here is similar, using calc.exe again. This repetition of creating tasks with similar names and using calc.exe might indicate an attempt to establish persistence.\n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe execution, which is usually used to check the current user, but in this context, it's just a single process. However, the combination of creating multiple scheduled tasks with unusual names and using calc.exe as the trigger is concerning. \n\nI should check if any of the files accessed are known malicious, but the paths provided are all standard Windows system files. The suspicious part is the scheduling tasks and the command lines. The use of \"OnLogon\" and \"OnStartup\" with calc.exe might be a red flag, even though calc.exe itself is a legitimate process. The way these tasks are created with non-standard names could be an indicator of compromise.\n\nAlso, the same command line structure is used in multiple entries, which might indicate a script or automated process trying to set up persistence. The fact that these tasks are created with the system user might give the attacker elevated privileges. \n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malware here, just the suspicious scheduling. But since the tasks are created with unusual names and the same command, it's worth investigating further. The confidence is moderate because while the actions are not definitively malicious, the patterns are suspicious enough to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious scheduled task creations with obfuscated names and use of calc.exe as payload, potential persistence mechanism detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
