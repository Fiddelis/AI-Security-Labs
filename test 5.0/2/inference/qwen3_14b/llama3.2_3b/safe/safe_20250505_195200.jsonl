However, the fact that multiple files are being created in the OfflineFiles subdirectory might be normal if it's part of an installation or update process.\n\nBut wait, the filenames have hashes in them, like e64cd0dc47a02cb26603e95624caee39.js.

However, if the process is known to be malicious or if the files are known to be harmful, confidence would be higher.

But the path here is in the AppData folder, which is common for both legitimate and malicious software. \n\nLooking at the winlog task, it's \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which is a standard event. The fact that these files are being created in a specific directory under Office's SolutionPackages might be part of a legitimate deployment.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, all showing files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names like excel-copilot-strings followed by some hash-like strings.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if these events are suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is a known Microsoft Office process, part of the Office Deployment Tool, used for installing and managing Office solutions. So, creating files in the SolutionPackages folder sounds normal for that process. But why so many files? Let me check the paths again.\n\nThe files are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory under PackageResources. The names of the files all start with \"excel-copilot-strings\" and have unique hash suffixes. That makes me think these might be part of a package or update. However, the repetition of some files (like two entries for d79c203bed721ff508c75221f3e02d77.js) might be a red flag. Are they duplicates? Maybe the system is trying to create the same file multiple times, which could indicate an error or maybe an attempt to overwrite.\n\nBut wait, the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is legitimate. Microsoft Office might be installing or updating, leading to multiple files being created. However, the fact that all these files are JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles folder could be unusual. Normally, Office might use .manifest or .cab files for updates. JavaScript files in that context don't ring a bell immediately. Maybe it's part of a new feature or a copilot-related component?\n\nAnother angle: the hashes in the filenames might be MD5 hashes. If I check the hash values, maybe they correspond to known malicious files. But without more info, that's hard to say. The user hasn't provided any indicators of compromise, so I can't confirm that. However, the sheer number of files being created by a single process might be considered abnormal. Legitimate installations usually don't create dozens of files in that directory.\n\nWait, but looking at the paths again, it's under the user's AppData folder. The SolutionPackages directory is typically used for storing packages, so maybe this is part of a custom solution or add-in. The presence of \"excel-copilot-strings\" suggests it's related to Excel Copilot, which might be a new feature. If that's the case, then these files could be part of a legitimate update.\n\nHowever, the repetition of the same files might indicate that the process is failing to create them once, leading to multiple attempts. Or perhaps it's a benign process that just creates many files. Without seeing other events (like process creation, network activity, or registry changes), it's hard to say. But based solely on the file creation events, the process is legitimate, but the volume and repetition might be worth investigating.\n\nSo, the classification here is tricky. On one hand, the process is known and the location is expected. On the other hand, the number of files and possible duplicates could be a sign of something unusual.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a new file in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are JavaScript files with names like \"word-copilot.min\" and \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by some hash-like strings.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior or something suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, right? It's related to the Office Deployment Tool or something similar. But creating multiple JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages folder... Hmm. Normally, SolutionPackages might be used for storing add-ins or solutions, but the filenames here look like they could be part of a copilot feature, maybe the AI assistant in Office.\n\nWait, but why are there so many files being created? There's also duplicates, like the same file being created twice. That might be a red flag. Also, the hash strings in the filenames are unique, which could be identifiers for different versions or packages. However, if these files are being created by SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process, it might be part of an update or installation process. But I should check if this is typical.\n\nAnother thing to note is the paths. They're all in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. That's a standard location for Office-related files. However, the presence of multiple JavaScript files might be unusual. Normally, you might see DLLs or other Office-specific files, but JS files could be part of web-based components or add-ins. \n\nBut wait, the filenames include \"copilot\" and \"strings.min\", which might relate to the Office Copilot feature, which is a new AI assistant. If this is a legitimate update, then maybe it's normal. However, the high number of files and duplicates could indicate something else. Also, the fact that all these files are created by the same process might be normal during an installation, but if this is happening frequently or without user interaction, that's suspicious.\n\nI should also consider if there are any known issues or malware using similar filenames. Sometimes, malware uses legitimate-sounding names to blend in. However, without more context, like process parentage, user interaction, or other logs, it's hard to tell. But given that all events are about file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a legitimate directory, and the filenames might be part of a feature update, it might be a false positive.\n\nBut the classification is whether it's interesting for investigation. Since there are multiple files created, some duplicates, and the process is SDXHelper.exe, which could be legitimate, but the sheer number of files might be worth looking into. However, considering that Office updates might involve creating multiple files, maybe it's not necessarily malicious. However, the presence of \"copilot\" in the filenames might be part of a new feature, so maybe it's normal. \n\nAlternatively, if the system is not expecting an Office Copilot update, this could be unexpected. But without knowing the system's context, it's hard to say. However, the fact that all the files are created by the same process and in the same directory might be normal for an installation. So, maybe this isn't suspicious. However, the justification would be that the files are created by a legitimate process in a standard location, but the high number of files and duplicates might be worth checking. But I'm not sure if that's enough to classify as interesting. Maybe the confidence is moderate. \n\nAlternatively, if there's no other suspicious activity, maybe it's not interesting. But the user is asking if the batch is relevant for investigation. Since all events are the same process creating files in a legitimate path, maybe it's not interesting. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nIf this were a normal installation, you might see a few files. But creating 12 files, some duplicates, might be more than usual. However, without knowing the normal behavior of SDXHelper.exe, it's hard to tell. But given that the files are in the correct directory and the process is legitimate, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the files are not expected, maybe it's interesting. But since I don't have more context, I have to go with the information given. The safest bet is to say it's not interesting because the process is legitimate, and the files are in the correct location, even though the number is high. But I'm not 100% confident. Maybe confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate file creation by SDXHelper.exe (a known Microsoft Office process) in standard Office SolutionPackages directories.
