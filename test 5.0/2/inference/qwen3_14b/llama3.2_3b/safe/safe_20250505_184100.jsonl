{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. The first few are about Discord.exe starting up and loading some DLLs, which seems normal. Then there's Update.exe creating files like Discord.lnk on the desktop and in the Start Menu. That might be part of a legitimate update process, but I need to check further.\n\nWait, there's a reg.exe command adding Discord to the Run key in the registry. That's a red flag because adding to Run can cause programs to start automatically. Also, there's another reg.exe command modifying the Discord protocol handler. That could be related to creating a custom protocol, which is sometimes used by malware to launch applications via URLs.\n\nThen, multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe and Discord.exe. While ProcessAccess alone isn't malicious, the combination with registry changes and file creation might indicate something's up. The fact that Update.exe is creating shortcuts and modifying the registry to run at startup could be part of a persistence mechanism. Also, the use of reg.exe to modify the registry without user interaction is suspicious.\n\nI should consider if these actions are part of a legitimate update. However, the repeated ProcessAccess events and the registry modifications might be signs of malicious behavior. The presence of multiple FileCreate events for Discord.lnk in different locations could be an attempt to create persistence or spread the application. The overall pattern of modifying the registry, creating files, and accessing processes might be indicative of a malicious payload trying to establish persistence on the system.\n\nBut I need to be careful. Some legitimate software might do similar things. However, the combination of these events, especially the registry changes and the creation of shortcuts, along with the use of Update.exe, which is not typically used by Discord for updates, raises suspicion. It's possible this is a legitimate activity, but the indicators lean towards being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: registry modifications adding Discord to the Run key and creating a custom protocol handler, repeated ProcessAccess events for Update.exe, and creation of Discord.lnk shortcuts in user directories.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about Update.exe being created with a command line that includes --install. That's part of the SquirrelTemp directory, which I know is often used by installers. Then there's a File created event for DiscordSetup.exe in the same SquirrelTemp folder. That seems normal for an installation process.\n\nNext, there are several Image loaded events for Update.exe loading system DLLs like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. Those are part of the .NET runtime, so that's expected if the application is using .NET. Then there's a File created event for Discord.exe in the Discord app directory. That's part of the installation, I think.\n\nThen there are multiple Process accessed events for Update.exe and Discord.exe. Those might be normal, but multiple accesses could indicate something, but not sure yet. Then another Process Create for Update.exe with a command line that includes --createShortcut and --setupIcon. That's part of setting up shortcuts and icons, which is typical during installation.\n\nAnother Image loaded event for Discord.exe loading ffmpeg.dll. That's a media library, so if Discord uses it, that's normal. But looking at the command line for Discord.exe, there are a bunch of parameters like --type=gpu-process and some other flags. Those seem like standard command-line arguments for a GPU process, maybe part of the application's normal operation.\n\nWait, but all these events are related to installing Discord. The initial events are about creating processes and files during installation. However, there's a lot of activity from Update.exe, which is common in installers. But the question is whether this is suspicious.\n\nI should check if there's anything unusual. The command line for the first Update.exe is --install, which is part of Squirrel's update process. The other command line for Update.exe includes creating a shortcut and setting up an icon, which is normal during installation. The loaded DLLs are all legitimate system or application files. The Discord.exe process is created with typical parameters for a GPU process.\n\nSo, putting this all together, it seems like a standard installation of Discord. There's no indication of malicious activity here. The events are all related to legitimate installation steps. Therefore, this batch is probably not interesting for investigation. The confidence would be low because all activities are normal for an installer.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent a standard software installation process (Discord) using legitimate system components and typical installer behavior (e.g., process creation, file creation, DLL loading). No suspicious or anomalous activity detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. The user provided a bunch of log entries, all related to Discord.exe and some reg.exe commands. The task is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the events: there are multiple entries of Discord.exe being accessed, some process creations, and a few reg.exe commands modifying registry keys related to Discord. The reg.exe commands are adding entries under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord, which seems to be setting up a protocol handler. That's normal for applications to register their own protocols, like \"discord:\/\/\" URLs. But I should check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nThe command lines for reg.exe look legitimate. They're adding the URL protocol, default icon, and the command to open the URL. The paths point to the Discord installation directory, which is expected. However, the fact that reg.exe is being used multiple times might be a red flag. But reg.exe is a standard Windows tool for registry edits, so unless there's something unusual in the parameters, it's probably normal.\n\nThen there's the Discord.exe process creation with a long command line. That's typical for applications with many command-line arguments. The arguments include things like --type=renderer, which is part of how Chrome-based apps (like Discord) launch their processes. The presence of --no-sandbox and --no-zygote might be worth noting, but those flags can be used for performance reasons or specific configurations. Not necessarily malicious, but maybe something to check.\n\nThere are also multiple ProcessAccess events for Discord.exe. If this is a legitimate application, having multiple access events might be normal, especially if it's communicating over the network. The Network connection detected event could be part of Discord connecting to its servers, which is normal behavior.\n\nHowever, the combination of multiple registry modifications and process accesses might indicate that Discord is behaving in a way that's more active than usual. But without any anomalies like unexpected network destinations, unusual file operations, or unexpected command-line arguments, it's hard to say this is malicious. The events don't show any signs of privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.\n\nOn the other hand, the repeated ProcessAccess events could be a sign of something. But if the application is just running normally, those events are expected. The key here is whether the events deviate from normal behavior. Since all the commands and processes are related to Discord, which is a legitimate application, and the registry changes are standard for setting up protocol handlers, I think this is not suspicious.\n\nSo, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING because the activities are consistent with normal Discord operation. The confidence is medium, maybe around 0.6, because while there's a lot of activity, it's all within expected parameters for the application.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events relate to legitimate Discord application behavior, including standard process creation, registry configuration for protocol handling, and network connectivity. No anomalous or malicious patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. First, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to Discord.exe. There are multiple instances of \"Pipe Created\" events, which might be normal for a messaging app. Then there's an entry with reg.exe modifying the registry, adding a command for Discord. That's a bit suspicious because registry changes can be part of malware installation. But I should check if it's legitimate. The command line shows it's setting the default value for a Discord shell command, which might be part of the app's normal setup, but I need to be cautious.\n\nNext, there are process accesses and terminations for Discord.exe, which are normal. Then there's an \"Update.exe\" process creating a file named Discord.lnk on the desktop. Creating a shortcut might be benign, but if it's part of an update process, maybe. However, the fact that Update.exe is involved could be a red flag. Also, there are multiple process accesses for Update.exe, which might indicate some activity that's not standard.\n\nLooking at the command lines for Discord.exe, they have various parameters like --type=crashpad-handler, --type=gpu-process, etc. These seem to be legitimate arguments for different processes within Discord, like handling crashes or GPU tasks. But I should check if the paths are correct. The executable path is in the AppData folder, which is common for applications, but sometimes malware uses similar paths.\n\nThe \"Image loaded\" events for Discord.exe and libEGL.dll are normal, as those are typical DLLs for graphics. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events could be a sign of something, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nNow, the key points are the registry modification by reg.exe and the creation of the Discord.lnk by Update.exe. The registry change might be part of a legitimate installation, but if the user didn't initiate it, that's a problem. The shortcut creation could be part of a legitimate update, but if the Update.exe isn't a trusted process, that's concerning. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious activity like network connections to suspicious IPs or execution of unknown files. All the processes are related to Discord, which is a legitimate application.\n\nBut wait, the command line for reg.exe is adding a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord\\shell\\open\\command. This is setting the default command to launch Discord.exe with some parameters. That's part of how applications set their associations, so it could be normal. However, if the user didn't install Discord, this might be a sign of a malicious installation. But without knowing the context, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple events related to Discord and the creation of a shortcut might be normal for an application update.\n\nConsidering all this, the events don't show clear signs of malware. They could be part of normal Discord operations, like updates or process creation. However, the combination of registry changes and shortcut creation by an Update.exe might warrant further investigation. Since the user is asking for classification, and there's no explicit malicious activity, but some suspicious elements, I would classify this as INTERESTING with moderate confidence. It's not a clear-cut attack, but there are enough anomalies to warrant looking into it more.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'Pipe Created' events for Discord.exe, registry modification via reg.exe, and creation of a Discord.lnk shortcut by Update.exe suggest potential legitimate activity but warrant further investigation due to unusual process interactions and file creation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

So, first, I need to check all the events together.\n\nFirst event: Discord.exe is created with a long command line. The command line has some parameters like --type=utility and --utility-sub-type=unzip.mojom.Unzipper. That seems odd because Discord normally doesn't handle unzipping. Maybe someone is using Discord to unzip files, which is not standard.\n\nSecond event: FileExecutableDetected for Google.Widevine.CDM.dll in the Temp directory. Widevine is related to DRM, but why is it being detected here? The file path is in the Temp folder, which might be normal, but the fact that it's being detected as an executable could be suspicious. Also, the process is Discord.exe, which might not typically interact with Widevine.\n\nThird and fourth events: Network connections from Discord.exe. Discord usually connects to its servers, but multiple network connections might be normal. However, if there's a pattern or if they're going to unusual destinations, that could be a red flag. But the logs don't mention the destination IPs or ports, so maybe not enough info here.\n\nPutting it all together: Discord.exe is involved in unzipping a file (which is not its usual function), and there's an executable detected in the Temp folder. The network connections are normal but could be part of malicious activity if the unzipped file is malware. However, without more context, like the file's hash or network destinations, it's a bit unclear. But the combination of unusual command line arguments and an unexpected executable might indicate a potential security issue. So, the classification is probably INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Discord.exe is involved in unusual activities including unpacking operations (unzip.mojom.Unzipper), detection of a Widevine CDM DLL in the Temp directory, and multiple network connections.
