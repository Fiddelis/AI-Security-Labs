{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's cmd.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. The winlog events are mostly Registry value set, Image loaded, and File created. \n\nNow, the first thing that stands out is that chrome.exe is involved in multiple Registry value set events. But chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much. However, there are also Image loaded events where chrome.exe loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. Loading these files isn't necessarily bad, but if they're being loaded by chrome.exe, that might be unusual. Maybe a malicious script is using chrome to load these DLLs? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are file creation events. The svchost.exe and powershell.exe processes are creating files in the Downloads directory. The user 'fiddelis' is involved here. The files are named componente_principal.txt, elemento_base.txt, and a winlogbeat configuration file. The winlogbeat file is part of a log shipper, so maybe someone is setting up monitoring. But why would svchost.exe and powershell.exe be creating these files? That could be normal if the user is downloading files, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it might be suspicious.\n\nAnother point: there are multiple Registry value set events by chrome.exe. If chrome is modifying registry keys, that could be a sign of a browser hijack or some kind of persistence mechanism. However, chrome does use the registry for some settings, so it's not always malicious. But combined with the other events, it might be a red flag.\n\nAlso, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file might indicate someone is trying to set up log collection, which could be part of a security investigation or maybe an attacker trying to exfiltrate data. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: The events include normal activities like file creation and registry changes, but the unusual aspects are chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times and loading specific Defender DLLs. Also, the use of svchost and powershell to create files in the Downloads directory might be benign, but could be part of a larger malicious activity. However, there's no direct evidence of malware here. The confidence is moderate because while some events are suspicious, they could also be part of legitimate user activity. So maybe \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing registry modifications and loading Windows Defender DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) may indicate evasion techniques.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. Now, PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's used with Start-Process and some batch files, that might be a red flag. Let me check the command lines. \n\nThe first entry has a command line that starts a process with a path like \"C:\\\\objeto_padrao\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\..\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\entrada_base_script.bat\". Wait, the path has \"..\\\\tarefa_ativo\" which is a directory traversal. That might be an attempt to access a parent directory, which could be part of a path manipulation attack. \n\nAnother entry has \"C:\\\\estrutura_base\\\\objeto_principal\\\\..\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\modulo_principal_script.bat\" again using \"..\\\\\". This pattern is repeated in another entry with \"C:\\\\tarefa_secundario\\\\estrutura_principal\\\\..\\\\componente_logico\\\\unidade_temporario_script.bat\". The use of \"..\\\\\" in the paths could indicate that the attacker is trying to navigate up the directory tree, possibly to access files that shouldn't be accessible or to execute scripts from unexpected locations.\n\nAlso, there are multiple events related to Registry value sets, which might be normal, but when combined with the PowerShell activities, it could suggest configuration changes. However, the more concerning part is the command line arguments with the directory traversal. \n\nAnother thing to note is that some of the paths have \"script.bat\" files being executed through PowerShell. While executing batch files isn't inherently malicious, the combination with the suspicious paths and the use of PowerShell's Start-Process might be indicative of an attempt to run scripts in a way that bypasses normal execution policies or hides the true origin of the script.\n\nThere's also a mention of \"File created\" event with a path in the AppData directory. While creating files in AppData can be normal, it's sometimes used by malware to store configuration or temporary files. However, without more context, it's hard to say, but combined with the other events, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nOther processes like chrome.exe and Calculator.exe are present, but their events are mostly registry changes, which might be normal. The ApplicationFrameHost.exe and conhost.exe are also part of standard Windows processes, so their presence isn't necessarily suspicious.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated use of PowerShell with directory traversal in the command lines. This could be an attempt to execute scripts from non-standard paths, possibly to evade detection. The confidence level is medium because while the patterns are suspicious, they might not be conclusive on their own. However, the combination of these events does warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute batch files with suspicious directory traversal patterns (e.g., '..\\\\tarefa_ativo'), which may indicate attempts to access parent directories or bypass path restrictions. This behavior is commonly associated with malicious activity, such as executing payloads from obfuscated paths.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, right? Unless there's something suspicious like connecting to unusual domains, but the logs don't mention specific domains here. So maybe not a red flag yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe involved. The first notable event is a registry value set, which isn't too bad on its own. But then there's a process creation event where powershell.exe is starting a script located at \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\\". Wait, the path has \"..\\\" which is a directory traversal. That might be a way to access files outside the intended directory. Hmm, that's a bit suspicious.\n\nNext, there are several image load events for powershell.exe, loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are normal. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so maybe legitimate. But I should check if there's any unusual loading here.\n\nThen there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting a temporary file could be normal, but combined with other activities, it might be part of something malicious. The script's name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which sounds like a test, but maybe it's a way to execute code without leaving traces.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe starting various scripts through Start-Process. The paths here also have directory traversals like \"..\\\". For example, \"C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\unidade_comum\\..\\\". This pattern could be used to bypass security restrictions or access files in parent directories, which might be a sign of an attack trying to execute scripts from unexpected locations.\n\nAlso, the command lines show that PowerShell is being used to start these scripts. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use in this manner, especially with multiple scripts and directory traversals, raises concerns. It could be part of a script-based attack or attempting to execute malicious code under the guise of normal operations.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of PowerShell being used with directory traversal in file paths, creating and deleting temporary scripts, and multiple network activities might indicate a potential security incident. Even though some activities are normal (like Chrome's network traffic), the PowerShell-related events with suspicious file paths and temporary script handling are red flags. The confidence here is medium because while there are suspicious elements, more context (like the actual content of the scripts or the domains being accessed) would be needed for higher confidence. But based on the given logs, it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show suspicious behavior, including directory traversal in file paths (e.g., '..\\\\'), temporary script creation\/deletion, and execution of batch files from non-standard locations.
