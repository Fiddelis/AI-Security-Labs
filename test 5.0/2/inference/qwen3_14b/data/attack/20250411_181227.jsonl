{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve PowerShell commands. The command_line fields show that they're using the ScheduledTask module to create new scheduled tasks. Each task is set to run calc.exe, which is a common legitimate tool, but the context here might be suspicious. The triggers are set to AtLogon, which means the task runs when a user logs in. The principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest, meaning it's running with elevated privileges. That's a red flag because creating scheduled tasks with admin rights can be part of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nNow, there are multiple entries with similar PowerShell commands, each registering a different task name like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. The repetition of such commands might indicate an attempt to create multiple scheduled tasks, possibly for persistence or to execute malicious code under admin rights. Even though calc.exe is a benign application, the method and the context (using PowerShell with admin privileges) are concerning.\n\nThen there are other events related to PowerShell, like registry value sets and process accesses. These could be part of the same malicious activity, such as modifying registry keys to ensure the task runs on startup or to hide the activity. The ImageLoad events mention loading mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are related to .NET Framework. While these are legitimate, their loading in this context might be part of a more complex attack, like using .NET to execute payloads.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any indication of actual malicious activity beyond the scheduled tasks. The logs don't show any direct execution of malware or network activity, just the creation of tasks and some registry changes. But the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with admin rights is a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior, even if the immediate action (running calc.exe) is harmless. Attackers often use such techniques to maintain access or execute commands later.\n\nThe presence of multiple similar events increases the confidence level. Even though some entries are just process accesses or registry changes, the combination with the scheduled task creations suggests a coordinated effort. The classification here should be INTERESTING because the pattern of creating multiple high-privilege scheduled tasks with PowerShell is a known tactic in cyber attacks. The confidence is high, maybe around 0.9, because the indicators are clear and repeated.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges (RunLevel Highest) under BUILTIN\\\\Administrators group, executing calc.exe. This pattern is commonly used for persistence or privilege escalation in malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: they're all about PowerShell loading various DLLs from Windows directories like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are all legitimate .NET framework files, so loading them isn't necessarily bad. But then there's an entry where PowerShell creates a file in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest... and then deletes it. That's a bit odd. Creating and deleting a script file might be part of a test or a legitimate process, but it's worth noting.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command line that's pretty complex. It's using ScheduledTask cmdlets to create a task that runs calc.exe at logon, with the Administrators group and highest privileges. That's a red flag. Using Scheduled Tasks to execute a calculator is unusual, and having it run as Administrators with high privileges could be an attempt to escalate privileges or perform malicious actions. The command line is obfuscated with & { ... }, which is common in PowerShell scripts to evade detection.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Chrome.exe setting registry values. However, Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry much, but maybe it's part of an extension or a legitimate update. However, with so many repeated entries, it might be worth checking if there's an anomaly here. But since they're all the same task and process, maybe they're just normal operations.\n\nThe later entries have \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks with the process field as None. That's suspicious because if the process is None, it might indicate that the event is not properly logged, or maybe it's a failed attempt or a system event that's not tied to a specific process. Multiple entries of this could point to attempted remote code execution, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the presence of these events in the batch might indicate a potential security issue.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell events, especially the ScheduledTask creation, are concerning. Creating a task that runs calc.exe with Admin rights is a clear indicator of potential malicious activity. The Temp file creation and deletion might be part of a script execution. The Chrome registry events might be benign, but the remote command executions with no process are suspicious. However, the main red flag is the PowerShell command that sets up a high-privilege scheduled task. This seems like a clear attempt to escalate privileges, which is a strong indicator of a security incident. Therefore, the batch is interesting and needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events indicate suspicious activity, including creation of a scheduled task with elevated privileges (running calc.exe as Administrators), temporary script file creation\/deletion, and loading of potentially legitimate but contextually suspicious DLLs. The 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process also raise concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, looking at the events, most of them are from chrome.exe with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". That's a lot of entries. But wait, chrome.exe modifying the registry—could that be normal? Well, Chrome does use the registry for some settings, but maybe not in such a high volume. However, all the entries here are the same: same process, same task, same file as None. Maybe that's just normal behavior, or maybe it's a sign of something malicious.\n\nThen there are a few other entries. One is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. Another entry is from powershell.exe creating a file called \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\". PowerShell is often used for scripting, but creating a file isn't necessarily suspicious. However, the name \"objeto_auxiliar\" is in Spanish, which might be a red flag if it's part of a larger set of suspicious activities.\n\nBut looking at the entire batch, the majority are chrome.exe registry events. If there's no other suspicious activity, maybe it's not that interesting. However, the repetition of the same event multiple times could indicate a potential issue. But I need to check if that's normal. Chrome might update its registry settings frequently, but if all the events are identical, that might be a sign of a problem. Alternatively, maybe the logs are being generated by a monitoring tool that's capturing the same event multiple times.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the events are in JSONL format, one per line. Are there any other anomalies? The other events don't seem too bad. The winlogbeat file is in the Downloads folder, which is a common place for such files. The powershell-created file might be benign. But the chrome.exe events—maybe they're related to a registry modification that's part of a malicious payload. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to say. \n\nThe classification should be \"INTERESTING\" if there's a potential threat. But since the majority of events are from chrome.exe doing registry sets, which could be normal, but the repetition might be a red flag. However, without more data, like the registry keys involved, it's hard to be certain. The presence of other events like file creation from powershell and winlogbeat might not be enough to raise a flag. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that there are multiple registry events from chrome.exe could be indicative of something. But I need to balance between false positives and actual threats. Since the user wants the entire batch considered, and the majority are chrome.exe registry events, but there's no clear malicious activity in the other events, maybe the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\". However, the repetition of the same event might still be suspicious. \n\nHmm, but in the absence of other indicators, maybe it's not enough. The justification would be that the majority of events are from chrome.exe, which is normal, and the other events don't show clear malicious behavior. Therefore, the confidence might be low, but not enough to classify as interesting. Alternatively, if the repetition is considered suspicious, then it's interesting. But I need to decide based on standard threat indicators. \n\nIn standard security practices, repeated registry modifications by a single process could be a sign of persistence or configuration changes. However, chrome.exe might do that during normal operations. Without more context, it's hard to say. So, maybe the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear malicious activity, but the confidence is moderate. However, the presence of multiple registry events might be a red flag. I think I need to lean towards \"INTERESTING\" because of the repeated registry modifications, even if they're from chrome.exe, as it's unusual and could be part of a larger attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated registry modification events from chrome.exe may indicate unusual behavior, potentially linked to persistence mechanisms or configuration tampering. Additional file creation events from PowerShell and Winlogbeat could be benign, but the volume of identical registry events raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if the whole batch is interesting for investigation. The options are either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence score.\n\nLooking at the events, the first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries with \"winlog\": \"{'task': 'Execute a Remote Command'}\". That seems suspicious because executing remote commands can be a sign of malicious activity, like a hacker trying to take control of the system. However, there are a lot of these entries, and they all have \"process\": \"None\", which might be a red flag. If the process is None, maybe the logs are incomplete or the event didn't capture the process details properly. But then again, maybe it's a legitimate activity, but I need to check more.\n\nThen, there's an entry where the process is \"WmiPrvSE.exe\" and the file path is \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskschd.dll\". WmiPrvSE.exe is related to Windows Management Instrumentation, which is a legitimate process, but taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler. However, if this is being loaded, maybe it's part of a scheduled task. But I need to see if there's any malicious activity here.\n\nAnother entry has \"svchost.exe\" with \"Registry value set\" events. svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, and changing registry values could be part of normal operations or malicious configuration. There are multiple entries here, which might indicate some changes happening, but I need to see if they're part of a pattern.\n\nThen there's a process called \"powershell.exe\" creating a file in the user's AppData directory. Creating files in AppData can be normal, but sometimes malware uses these directories to store malicious scripts. Also, there's a line with \"New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \\\"calc.exe\\\"\" which seems like a PowerShell command to create a scheduled task that runs calc.exe. But calc.exe is a legitimate calculator, so maybe this is a test or a red herring. However, if this is part of a larger malicious script, it could be a sign of something more serious.\n\nAnother entry shows \"svchost.exe\" creating a file in \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum\". The name \"unidade_comum\" doesn't ring a bell immediately, but creating a task in the System32 Tasks directory might be suspicious. Scheduled tasks in that location could be part of a persistent mechanism for malware.\n\nThen there's a \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so this might be part of normal operations, but the file name \".winlogbeat.yml.new\" could be a configuration file. Maybe it's just updating the configuration, but I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity around it.\n\nAlso, there's a \"chrome.exe\" loading \"amsi.dll\" and \"MpOAV.dll\". AMSI is the Windows Anti-Malware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender. Loading these might be normal, but if there's an unusual number of such events, it could indicate that something is trying to bypass these security features.\n\nPutting this all together: there are multiple \"Execute a Remote Command\" events, which are concerning. The PowerShell script creating a scheduled task with calc.exe might be a red flag, especially if it's part of a larger malicious payload. The creation of a scheduled task in the System32 directory could be a sign of persistence. Also, the multiple registry changes by svchost.exe could be part of a configuration change or something more malicious.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be benign. For example, creating a scheduled task with calc.exe might be a test or a legitimate action. The presence of winlogbeat.exe and chrome.exe might be part of normal system operations. But the combination of multiple suspicious events, especially the remote command executions and the scheduled task creation, makes me lean towards this being interesting for investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be normal, but the cluster of suspicious activities is enough to warrant further look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events, PowerShell creating a scheduled task with calc.exe, and suspicious file creation in system directories suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
