{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice a few processes that are normal, like chrome.exe and whoami.exe. But then there's a lot of activity with certutil.exe. Certutil is often used for encoding and decoding files, which can be legitimate, but in some contexts, it's used in attacks. For example, the command line shows encoding calc.exe into a temporary file and then decoding it back. That's suspicious because calc.exe is a normal Windows utility, but using certutil to encode\/decode might be part of a larger malicious payload.\n\nLooking at the events, there's a process where certutil is decoding a file from the temp directory into another executable. That decoded file is then executed, which could be a malicious payload. Also, there are multiple registry value set events, which might indicate changes to the system's configuration, possibly to persist the attack or modify behavior.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. These are system files, but if an unexpected process is loading them, it might be a sign of something malicious. Also, the file created event for winlogbeat.yml.new might be related to configuring a log collector, but if it's part of an attack, that's a red flag.\n\nHowever, there are also some normal processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe. But the combination of certutil's usage, the registry changes, and the suspicious file operations makes me think this could be part of a malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because some of these processes are legitimate, but the pattern here is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files (potentially exfiltrating data or executing payloads), registry modifications, and creation of temporary executable files. SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs (combase.dll, urlmon.dll) raises concerns about potential injection or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are about chrome.exe doing network connections and modifying the registry. That's pretty common, right? Browsers often connect to the internet and might change some registry settings. But there are a few other events that stand out.\n\nLooking at the sixth event, there's a file created by powershell.exe at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\componente_auxiliar.txt'. Creating a file in the Downloads folder might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with other events, it could be a sign of something. However, the file name seems generic, so maybe it's just a normal file.\n\nThen there's the 14th event where SDXHelper.exe loads urlmon.dll from System32. Wait, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Loading urlmon.dll is normal, but the process name might be unusual. However, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate software. Maybe it's part of some application, but without more context, it's hard to say. But since the file path is System32, which is a trusted location, it might be okay.\n\nAnother event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation. The file path seems to be part of an installation directory, so that's probably legitimate.\n\nThen there are multiple events from powershell.exe accessing the registry and processes. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a standard tool for administrators. However, multiple registry changes and process accesses might indicate some activity. But again, without more context like unusual commands or unexpected modifications, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, considering all events together. The majority are from chrome.exe doing normal activities. The other events are either from legitimate processes (winlogbeat, powershell) doing normal tasks or from SDXHelper.exe, which could be a red flag if it's not known. However, there's no clear indication of malicious activity here. No suspicious file paths, no unusual network connections beyond what a browser would do, and no signs of privilege escalation or data exfiltration.\n\nSo, the justification here is that while there are some non-standard processes, they don't show clear signs of malicious behavior. The confidence is moderate because there's no concrete evidence, but the presence of SDXHelper.exe might warrant further investigation. However, since the user wants a classification based on the entire batch, and there's no definitive malicious activity, it's probably not interesting. But I need to check again.\n\nWait, SDXHelper.exe is not a known Windows process. If that's a third-party application, maybe it's legitimate. But if it's not, that's a problem. However, the event only shows that it loaded urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL. Without more events related to that process, like network activity or file creation, it's hard to say. The rest of the events are normal. So overall, I think the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The confidence is around 0.6, as there are some unusual processes but no concrete indicators.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Most events involve standard chrome.exe network activity and registry modifications. Other events include legitimate processes (powershell.exe, winlogbeat.exe) performing normal operations, and SDXHelper.exe loading a standard system DLL (urlmon.dll). No clear indicators of malicious behavior or anomalous patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
