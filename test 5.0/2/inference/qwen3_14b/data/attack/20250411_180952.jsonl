{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe doing a DNS query, MpDefenderCoreService.exe having a network connection, and chrome.exe doing similar things. Those seem normal. Browsers and system services often make network connections and DNS queries. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nBut then I see a cmd.exe process with a command line that adds a user to the domain with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and adds them to the Domain Admins group. That's a red flag. Creating domain admin accounts is a big deal. The password looks temporary, which might be part of an attack where they're setting up access.\n\nNext, there's a net1.exe process, which is unusual. The regular net.exe is common, but net1.exe might be a typo or a malicious binary. The command lines for adding users and groups to the Domain Admins group are repeated. That's another sign of someone trying to escalate privileges.\n\nThen there are multiple PowerShell processes accessing files and registry events. While PowerShell is common, the combination with registry changes and file creations could be part of persistence mechanisms. Also, the file creation by winlogbeat.exe might be normal, but the other files created by powershell.exe and svchost.exe need checking. However, the main issue here is the domain admin account creation and the use of net1.exe.\n\nThe presence of multiple commands adding users to Domain Admins, using potentially malicious executables like net1.exe, and the command-line arguments suggest an attempt to compromise the domain. This is a clear indicator of suspicious activity that requires further investigation. The confidence is high because these actions are typically associated with malicious intent in a network environment.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin accounts via 'net.exe'\/'net1.exe' with temporary passwords, repeated registry modifications, and unusual process executions (e.g., 'cmd.exe' adding users to 'Domain Admins' group). These indicate potential privilege escalation and lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these four events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each one.\n\nFirst event: svchost.exe created a file at C:\\Windows\\System32\\sru\\SRUtmp.log. Wait, SRUtmp.log is part of the System Resource Usage temporary files. I remember that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. Creating SRUtmp.log might be normal, like during system updates or service operations. Not sure yet, but maybe not suspicious.\n\nSecond event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a Beats tool used for collecting and forwarding logs. If the user is installing or configuring it, creating a new config file (.yml.new) makes sense. But I should check if the path is typical. The file is in the Downloads folder, which is common for user-installed software. Maybe not suspicious unless there's unexpected behavior here.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe set a registry value. Registry changes can be risky. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also used by administrators. Without more context, like which registry key was modified, it's hard to tell. But the event mentions \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"â€”maybe the rule is part of a monitoring system. Not sure yet.\n\nFourth event: powershell.exe accessed a process. Process access could be normal, like when PowerShell is managing other processes. But again, without more details, it's hard to say. Maybe part of a script or legitimate activity.\n\nLooking at all events together: svchost and winlogbeat are legitimate processes. The first event's file path is system-related, which might be normal. The second event is about a user-installed tool's config file. The PowerShell events could be part of normal administration, but registry changes and process access might be red flags if they're unexpected. However, since there's no indication of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unusual command lines, or multiple suspicious events, maybe it's not a high priority. But the combination of PowerShell events might warrant further investigation. However, the confidence isn't extremely high. Maybe \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence because PowerShell activities are often associated with attacks, but the other events don't show clear signs of compromise. Alternatively, if the PowerShell events are part of normal operations, it might be not interesting. I need to balance between the potential risks and the lack of clear malicious indicators. Maybe the justification is that PowerShell activities could be legitimate, but the presence of multiple events might be worth looking into. So, classification is \"INTERESTING\" with confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities (registry modification and process access) alongside legitimate process file operations may indicate potential system interaction or configuration changes requiring further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
