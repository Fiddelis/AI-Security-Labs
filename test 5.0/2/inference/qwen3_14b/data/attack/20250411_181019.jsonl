{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not. The main thing here is to look for any suspicious activity that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file called .winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipper, and creating configuration files is part of its setup. But maybe the path is in the Downloads folder, which could be a red flag if it's not expected. However, the file name is a typical config file, so maybe that's just a regular installation.\n\nThen there are several entries about ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe having registry value set events. Registry changes can be suspicious, but these processes are legitimate. For example, Calculator.exe is a standard app, and ApplicationFrameHost is part of the Windows UI. PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, so maybe that's just normal user activity. But if there's a lot of registry changes from PowerShell, that could be a sign of something malicious, like changing settings to persist or hide.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are numerous. Most of them are registry value sets and image loaded events. The image loaded events point to amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. Loading those is normal, so that's probably just Chrome interacting with the system's security features. However, the sheer number of registry changes from chrome.exe might be worth looking into. Could Chrome be doing something unusual here? Maybe, but Chrome is a common application, so it's possible that these are just normal operations.\n\nAnother thing to note is the presence of multiple registry events from different processes. While some are from legitimate apps, the repetition might indicate automated scripts or malware trying to modify the registry. But without more context, it's hard to tell. The fact that there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious events makes this a bit tricky.\n\nThe main red flag here might be the multiple registry modifications, especially from processes like PowerShell and Chrome. However, since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity (like unauthorized access, unexpected network traffic, or suspicious file downloads), it's possible that this is just normal user behavior. But the high number of registry events could be a sign of something more, so maybe it's worth investigating further.\n\nOverall, I'm leaning towards INTERESTING because of the high volume of registry changes and the involvement of PowerShell, which is often used in attacks. But I'm not 100% sure, so the confidence might be around 0.6 or 0.7. The justification would be the multiple registry modifications and the presence of PowerShell, which could indicate potential malicious activity that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events from legitimate processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe) combined with a file creation event by winlogbeat.exe in a temporary directory may indicate either benign configuration changes or potential malicious activity. The high frequency of registry events warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe activities. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The events mention 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set', which might be normal, but I need to check for suspicious patterns.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe entries, one of them has a command line that includes creating a service with a binPath pointing to a script that doesn't exist: \"c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\". The fact that the script is non-existent could be a red flag. Attackers might try to execute non-existent files to test if they can bypass defenses or to indicate an attempt to run malicious code that's not yet present.\n\nAnother cmd.exe entry has a command line that creates a service with another non-existent script: \"c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1\". This seems similar. Creating services with non-existent paths might be an attempt to establish persistence or to set up a backdoor that's not immediately active.\n\nThere's also a 'sc create' command for a service named 'win32times', which is a suspicious name. Services with unusual names can be indicative of malicious activity. The use of 'sc' (Service Controller) to create services is normal, but combined with the non-existent paths and the PowerShell access events, it raises suspicion.\n\nThe 'Registry value set' events are frequent. While changing registry values is normal, if done in a way that modifies startup entries or service configurations, it could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context on what specific registry keys are being modified, it's a bit hard to tell. But combined with the service creation attempts, it might be part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nThe 'Image loaded' events for urlmon.dll are mentioned. Urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows component, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a sign of something wrong. However, in this case, the events are for 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe', which are standard applications. It might not be directly malicious, but the context of other events could make this suspicious.\n\nThere's also a 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' entries with registry modifications. These are system processes, so their activity in the registry might be part of normal operations, but again, the combination with other suspicious commands could indicate something more.\n\nThe presence of multiple 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell might indicate that it's being used to execute commands or scripts. However, without seeing the actual commands, it's hard to be certain. But when combined with the service creation attempts and registry changes, it's a pattern that could be part of an attack.\n\nNow, considering all these points: the non-existent scripts in service creation, the frequent registry modifications, and the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for potentially malicious tasks. Even though some of these actions could be part of normal system behavior, the combination here seems to point towards an attempt to create persistence mechanisms or execute scripts that aren't present, which could be part of an attack.\n\nTherefore, I think this batch of events is interesting for investigation. The confidence is medium because while some actions are normal, the combination of non-existent file paths in service creation and multiple registry changes suggests potential malicious activity that needs further examination.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: (1) Attempts to create services with non-existent scripts (e.g., 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1'), (2) Frequent registry modifications by system processes (services.exe, svchost.exe), (3) PowerShell\/cmd.exe usage patterns that may indicate persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
