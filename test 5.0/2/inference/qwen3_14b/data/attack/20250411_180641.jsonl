{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look at these logs. The first event is about chrome.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender DLL. That's a bit unusual because Chrome typically doesn't need to load Defender's DLLs. The path is in the ProgramData directory, which is common for system files, but maybe this is a legitimate update or scan. However, the second event shows chrome.exe setting a registry value. That could be normal if it's part of an extension or update, but it's also a potential red flag if it's modifying settings without user consent.\n\nThe third event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file makes sense, especially if it's part of setup or data collection. The file name includes .new, which might indicate it's a temporary file being moved into place. \n\nPutting it all together, the first two events involving Chrome might be benign, but the combination of loading a Defender DLL and changing registry values could be suspicious. However, without more context like unusual process behavior or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say. The third event seems normal. Overall, there's a moderate risk here, but not enough to be certain. I'd classify this as interesting but with medium confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Chrome.exe loading a Windows Defender DLL and modifying registry values could indicate potential tampering or malicious activity, though further context is needed to confirm.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to chrome.exe making network connections. That's normal, but there are a few other processes that stand out. There's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times, which can be a red flag if it's doing something unusual. Then there's whoami.exe, which is a legitimate command to get user info, but maybe in this context, it's part of something else.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process that runs a command involving csc.exe, which is the C# compiler. The command line seems a bit suspicious with the use of temp directories and compiling a .cs file into an executable. That might be part of code injection or compiling malicious code.\n\nThen there are several file creation events for executables in the Temp directory. Files like pacote_logico.exe and unidade_padrao.exe are created, which could be malicious payloads. Also, image load events for various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework, which might be normal, but combined with the other activities, it's concerning.\n\nThe presence of multiple process creations and registry events, especially with PowerShell and CMD, along with the compilation and execution of temporary files, suggests potential malicious activity. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination and the use of temp directories for executable creation are suspicious. This could indicate an attack, like a phishing attempt or a dropper dropping malware.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the batch does show signs of potentially malicious behavior. The confidence is high because of the multiple suspicious events and the use of system tools in a way that's often seen in attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell and CMD processes executing compiled code in temporary directories, creation of executable files in AppData\/Local\/Temp, and loading of unusual DLLs. These patterns are commonly associated with malware execution and persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the log entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first entry: tarefa_base.exe loaded clrjit.dll. That's a .NET framework DLL, so maybe part of normal operations. But I should note that. Then elemento_ativo.exe terminated. Not sure yet. \n\nNext, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, notepad.exe, and others are setting registry values. That's common, but maybe if there's a pattern. Powershell.exe being accessed and process access events might be normal, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell for malicious activities. \n\nThen, calc.exe loaded urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate DLL, but why is it being loaded by calc.exe? Maybe not a big deal. Then, Calculator.exe (capitalized?) also loaded urlmon.dll. Wait, the process name is Calculator.exe, which might be a typo or a different executable. Maybe a malicious version? But without more info, hard to tell.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a log shipper, so creating a config file is normal. But the filename is .yml.new, which might be part of an update or configuration change. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen, chrome.exe has multiple registry value set events. Chrome does a lot of registry changes, especially with updates or extensions. But the repetition might be normal. However, one of the chrome.exe entries loaded amsi.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's legitimate. But if there's an unusual path or if it's being accessed in a non-standard way, that could be a red flag.\n\nWait, looking back, there's also a task for Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad) for tarefa_base.exe with clrjit.dll. That's a .NET JIT compiler, so that's normal. But maybe the process name tarefa_base.exe is not a standard Windows process. Similarly, elemento_ativo.exe isn't a standard process either. Those names might be in Portuguese, like \"tarefa\" meaning task and \"elemento\" meaning element. Could be legitimate, but could also be malware using localizable names.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple registry changes by various processes might indicate some configuration changes. But without more context, like unusual keys or values being modified, it's hard to say. However, the presence of non-standard processes and the repetition of certain events might be worth looking into.\n\nAnother point is that Calculator.exe is mentioned twice, once with ImageLoad and once with a registry event. If that's a legitimate process, it's normal. But if there's a discrepancy in the process names (like Calculator.exe vs. calc.exe), that could be a sign of something. However, Windows does have both calc.exe and Calculator.exe (the latter being the full name, maybe from a different source).\n\nOverall, there's some suspicious process names and multiple registry changes, but nothing definitively malicious. However, the combination of non-standard process names and multiple events might warrant further investigation. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there's enough to flag it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple non-standard process names (e.g., 'tarefa_base.exe', 'elemento_ativo.exe') and repeated registry modification events by common utilities (chrome.exe, powershell.exe) suggest potential anomalous behavior.
