{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_194600.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: svchost.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, svchost hosts various system services, so DNS queries are common. Not a red flag here.\n\nNext, User Account Management event. That could be something like a user being created or modified. But since there's no process name, maybe it's a system event. Not sure yet, but not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen, notepad.exe loading urlmon.dll. Urlmon is part of Windows for handling URLs, so loading that from notepad might be normal, but maybe if it's from an unusual path? The path here is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is standard. So that seems okay.\n\nWinlogbeat creating a file in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. The file path looks like a typical setup. But there are multiple entries for the same file being created. Maybe it's just part of the setup process, but repeated events might be worth checking.\n\nServices.exe and logon events. Services.exe is a legitimate process, and logon events are normal. The Special Logon event might be related to a service account, which is normal too.\n\nMpDefenderCoreService.exe has a network connection. That's part of Windows Defender, so connecting to the network is expected for updates or scanning.\n\nNotepad creating arquivo.txt in Downloads. That's a user-created file, which is normal. The same file is created multiple times, but maybe the user is just saving it multiple times. Not suspicious.\n\nAnother notepad.exe event with a registry value set. Notepad doesn't typically modify the registry, so that might be odd. But the event says \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" under notepad. Wait, notepad.exe isn't known for changing registry keys. That could be a sign of something unusual. Maybe a malicious process is using notepad as a dropper?\n\nLooking at the command line for rundll32.exe: it's running shell32.dll with a specific GUID. That might be part of a legitimate process, but sometimes malicious software uses rundll32 to execute code. However, the command line here seems to be a standard one for creating a local server, so maybe it's okay.\n\nExplorer.EXE modifying the registry. Explorer can modify the registry, but it's a bit unusual. However, if the user is interacting with the system, maybe they're changing settings. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother notepad.exe process creating arquivo.txt. The same as before. Maybe the user is just working on that file.\n\nThe repeated creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new by winlogbeat. That's part of the setup, so normal. But multiple entries might be noise.\n\nNow, looking for anomalies: the notepad.exe modifying the registry. That's a red flag. Notepad isn't supposed to modify the registry. That could indicate a malicious process or a hijacked notepad. Also, the same file being created multiple times might be a sign of something, but if it's just a user saving the file, it's normal. However, the registry modification by notepad is suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the rundll32.exe command line. The GUID {9aa46009-3ce0-458a-a354-715610a075e6} is associated with the Windows Search service, so that's legitimate. So maybe that's okay.\n\nSo the main suspicious event is the notepad.exe modifying the registry. That's not normal. Also, the multiple file creations could be part of a setup, but combined with the registry change, it might be worth investigating.\n\nTherefore, the classification would be INTERESTING because there's a notepad.exe process modifying the registry, which is unusual and could indicate malicious activity. The confidence is around 0.65 because while there's one suspicious event, others are normal. But I need to check if there are other signs. The other events are mostly legitimate system processes. So the main indicator is the registry modification by notepad.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple notepad.exe processes are involved in registry modifications (RegistryEvent) and file creation, which is unusual behavior for a standard text editor. This could indicate potential malicious activity or process injection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
