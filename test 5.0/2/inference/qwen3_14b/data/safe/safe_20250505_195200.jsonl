However, the fact that multiple files are being created with similar names could indicate something. The hash part of the filenames might be unique identifiers for different versions or resources, which could be normal during an update. But the repetition of the same filenames being created multiple times might be a red flag. \n\nWait, looking closer, some files are listed more than once. For example, \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_8d60ff5953a3c5a0b82fae7df2198cbc.js\" appears twice.

However, without any other suspicious activity (like network connections, unusual process behavior, or other security events), it's hard to say.\n\nAnother angle: the hash in the filename might be part of a naming convention for different language packs or versions. If multiple files are being created as part of an installation, that might be normal. However, the same file being created multiple times could be a mistake in the installation process or a sign of something wrong.\n\nBut considering that all the events are from the same process and the same directory, and the files are JavaScript files, which are common for web-based applications or Office add-ins, this might be part of a legitimate operation. However, the high number of files (over 15 entries) might be more than typical for a normal installation. \n\nOn the other hand, if this is part of a malicious activity, the attacker might be using SDXHelper.exe to drop files in that directory. However, without any other indicators like unusual process arguments, parent processes, or network activity, it's hard to confirm. \n\nSince the user is asking for a classification based on the batch as a whole, and the only thing observed is the creation of multiple JavaScript files by a legitimate process, the justification is that while the activity is unusual, it's not definitively malicious. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a moderate confidence, but there's a possibility it's \"INTERESTING\" if the repetition is considered suspicious. However, given that the process is legitimate and the files are in a known directory, the confidence might be lower. \n\nWait, but the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could be a sign of an issue.

Since the files are named with hashes and the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is legitimate, it's more likely benign. So, the confidence would be around 0.6, but maybe higher. Alternatively, if the system is not using Copilot, this could be suspicious. But without that context, it's safer to say not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, which appears to be part of legitimate Office functionality (e.g., Excel Copilot resources).

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by scanning through the entries.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files located in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames have hashes in them, which might be normal for some kind of packaging or resource management. But why so many files being created? Maybe it's part of a legitimate Office update or something related to Excel Copilot? But then again, that's a bit unusual. I should check if there's any pattern here.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're all under the user's AppData Local Microsoft Office folder. That's a common place for temporary files or application-specific data. However, the fact that multiple files are being created with similar names and hashes might indicate some kind of automated process. But is that suspicious? Maybe not on its own, but combined with other events?\n\nWait, there's also an entry about MdSched.exe being created as a process. MdSched is part of the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool, right? But the command line here is just \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\MdSched.exe\", which seems normal. However, if this is part of a scheduled scan, maybe that's expected. But I don't see any other events related to that process beyond the creation. Hmm.\n\nThen there's consent.exe loading amsi.dll and urlmon.dll. Consent.exe is typically related to Windows updates or system changes, and loading amsi.dll (Antimalware Scan Interface) is normal for security checks. Urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer, so that's also normal. These might just be part of regular system operations.\n\nNow, considering the SDXHelper.exe activity. SDXHelper is a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, especially for handling add-ins or solutions. But creating multiple JavaScript files in that directory... Maybe it's part of a legitimate Office add-in deployment. However, the repetition of the same filenames with different hashes might be a red flag. Are these files being created multiple times? If they're being created multiple times in a short period, that could be suspicious. But looking at the logs, each entry is a separate event, but I don't have timestamps. Wait, the user didn't provide timestamps, so I can't tell if they're spread out or clustered.\n\nAnother point: the files are named with \"excel-copilot-strings\" followed by a hash. Excel Copilot is a feature in Microsoft 365, so maybe these are localization files or resources. But again, the same file being created multiple times might be an issue. However, if the hash changes each time, that could be part of updates. But the same filename with different hashes could also be a sign of something malicious trying to replace files.\n\nBut wait, the same filename is repeated in the logs. For example, \"excel-copilot-strings_2318d1a7dc81650aee9c1ed4ec091415.js\" appears twice. That might be normal if the process is creating the same file multiple times, but maybe that's just part of the process. However, if that's happening a lot, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nAlso, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file is normal. But the fact that it's in the Downloads folder might be a bit odd. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together: The majority of events are from SDXHelper.exe creating files in a legitimate Office directory. The other events are from normal system processes. There's no indication of network activity, privilege escalation, or other suspicious behaviors. The files created might be part of a legitimate Office feature, but the repetition and the hash-based filenames could be a red flag. However, without more context or anomalies like unexpected network connections or unauthorized access, it's hard to be certain.\n\nSo, the classification here is a bit tricky. On one hand, the SDXHelper activity could be legitimate. On the other, the repetition and the location might be suspicious. But since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity beyond the file creation, and considering that Microsoft Office processes do create files in these directories, I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a moderate confidence. However, if the user is looking for potential threats, the repetition might be worth investigating further, but based on the given data, it's not conclusive enough to classify as \"INTERESTING\".\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, which may be part of legitimate Office add-in or resource management.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a file in specific directories under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages.

SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in managing add-ins or solutions. But creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory... Hmm. Normally, Office might download or generate files as part of its operations, but the repetition here might be a red flag. \n\nWait, looking at the file paths, they're all under PackageResources\\OfflineFiles. That directory is typically used for storing files that are part of Office add-ins or solutions when they're being used offline. However, the names of the JavaScript files don't seem to match standard Office components. For example, \"excel-copilot-strings\" might be related to a feature like Excel Copilot, but the presence of multiple files with different hash-like names could indicate that something is trying to deploy a lot of resources, which might be part of a malicious payload.\n\nAlso, the same process, SDXHelper.exe, is creating these files repeatedly. If this is part of a legitimate Office update or add-in installation, I would expect some variation in the process names or maybe other related events like network activity or registry changes. But here, it's just file creation events. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the hashes in the filenames are unique, which might be used to obfuscate the actual content of the files. Malware often uses such techniques to avoid detection. However, without analyzing the content of the files, it's hard to be certain. But the mere fact that so many files are being created by a process that's typically associated with Office solutions could be benign if it's part of an add-in deployment. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the batch is interesting for investigation. The key here is that all these events are from the same process and same directory structure. If this is a normal operation, there might be a pattern that's consistent. However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files with similar naming conventions might be indicative of a malicious activity, such as downloading components of a malware or an exploit kit. \n\nAlternatively, it could be a legitimate scenario where a new add-in is being installed, and the files are part of that add-in's resources. But given that the files are JavaScript, which are often used in web-based attacks, it's possible that this is part of a phishing or exploit scenario. \n\nConsidering the confidence level, I would say there's a moderate chance of this being malicious. The justification is the unusual number of file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard way, but without more context, it's not definitive.

The file names are all similar, starting with \"excel-copilot-strings_\" followed by a hash. There are multiple entries for each file, but they seem to be duplicates, maybe from different log entries or timestamps. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, part of Microsoft's Office suite, right? It's involved in handling add-ins or solutions. But creating multiple files with hashes in the OfflineFiles folder... Hmm, that might be normal if it's part of an update or installation. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could be a red flag. Maybe it's a sign of something malicious trying to inject files or replicate itself. \n\nWait, but there's also an entry from MdSched.exe, which is related to the Microsoft Search service. The event here is a registry value being set. That's a normal operation for MdSched.exe, so that might not be suspicious. \n\nThe key point here is the repeated creation of files by SDXHelper.exe.

However, if the process is part of Office's normal operations, maybe it's just updating or re-creating files. Alternatively, if these files are being created in a location that's not typical for Office, or if the process isn't supposed to be creating files there, that could be an issue. However, the path does point to a legitimate Office directory, so that might be okay.\n\nAnother angle: the names of the files. The \"excel-copilot-strings\" suggests they're language strings for Excel Copilot, which is a feature in newer Office versions. The other files with \"vendors~\" might be third-party libraries.

Also, the hashes in the filenames are unique, which could be an attempt to obfuscate the file names, making them harder to detect.\n\nConsidering that all the events are from the same process and the same directory, but different files, it's possible that this is a legitimate process, but the high volume and the nature of the files might be worth investigating.

However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files in the same location could be a red flag. \n\nWait, but is this normal behavior? If the user is installing multiple packages or updates, maybe this is expected.

So, there are multiple entries here, all showing that the SDXHelper.exe process is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with a pattern that includes \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a long hash-like string. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, right? It's involved in managing solution packages. But creating so many files with those names... Hmm. The filenames look like they might be minified JavaScript files, which are common in web applications. However, the location is within the Office installation directory, which is a bit unusual for JavaScript files.\n\nNow, the repetition of the same process and the same file paths multiple times. Each entry is almost identical, just the hash part changes. That could indicate that the process is creating multiple files, maybe as part of an update or deployment. But why so many? Also, the hashes don't look like standard ones. They might be unique to this particular deployment, but that's not necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\nWait, but the fact that all these files are being created by SDXHelper.exe in the SolutionPackages folder. If this is a legitimate update, the files might be part of a new Office add-in or something similar. However, the presence of \"aicopilot\" in the filename makes me think of Microsoft's AI Copilot feature. Maybe this is related to that. But I should check if this is a known legitimate process.\n\nAlso, the path is under \"OfflineFiles,\" which might be part of an offline installation or cached resources. But the repeated creation of these files could be a sign of something else. If this is a normal process, there might be a larger number of such files, but maybe not with such specific naming patterns.\n\nAnother angle: the use of \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" in the winlog task. That's an event ID 1, which is part of the Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Detection. This rule is triggered when a file is created, and it's used to detect potentially malicious activity. However, the presence of this event doesn't automatically mean it's malicious. It's just an indicator that the system is monitoring file creation.\n\nBut considering that all these events are coming from SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process, but creating a lot of files with similar names. If this is part of a legitimate update, the system might be downloading and installing multiple resources. However, the repetition of the same process and the same directory might be a red flag. Also, the fact that the same file is being created multiple times (as seen in the JSON entries) might indicate a loop or a mistake in the process.\n\nWait, looking again, each entry is a separate file with a different hash. So maybe each entry is a different file, but all created by the same process. That's possible. However, the number of files is quite high. Let me count: there are 16 entries here. So 16 different files created by SDXHelper.exe. That seems like a lot for a normal process. Maybe during an installation, but even then, it's a lot.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the hash in the filename. If these are legitimate files, they might have consistent naming conventions. But the hashes here are long and random-looking, which might be a sign of obfuscation. However, that's not definitive. Alternatively, they could be checksums or unique identifiers for each file.\n\nI should also check if SDXHelper.exe is known to create such files. If this is a legitimate process, then it's not a security issue. However, if there's no known legitimate activity associated with this, then it could be a sign of malicious behavior. Since I don't have access to external databases, I have to rely on my existing knowledge.\n\nIn some cases, attackers might use legitimate processes to create files in trusted directories to avoid detection. But SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office, so it's a trusted process. However, if it's creating files that are not part of the expected Office components, that could be suspicious.\n\nPutting this all together: the events are all from a legitimate process, but the volume and the nature of the files created might be unusual. The fact that the same process is creating multiple files with similar names in a location that's not typical for JavaScript files might indicate something. However, without more context, like other events or indicators of compromise, it's hard to be certain.\n\nBut since the user wants a classification, I have to decide. The repetition and the location might be enough to flag it as interesting. However, the confidence might be moderate because it's not a clear-cut case.

The logs only mention file creation, no other events like network connections, registry changes, or process injections. That could mean it's a benign process, but it could also be that the logs are incomplete. \n\nI should also think about the frequency. There are multiple entries, but each file is created twice.

However, the classification is whether it's interesting for investigation. Since all events are the same process creating similar files in expected locations, maybe it's not interesting.

All the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are JavaScript files with names that include \"officeaicopilot-strings\" and \"word-copilot.min\" with various hash-like suffixes.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office software, possibly related to the AI Copilot feature. The files are being created in the OfflineFiles subdirectory, which might be part of the Office installation's package management. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could be a red flag. \n\nBut wait, looking at the paths, they all point to different package directories (like 82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b and 8988909c18d8bf3dd4c823acc260243c). These look like unique identifiers for different packages. The JavaScript files might be part of the Office Copilot feature's resources. However, the fact that the same file is being created multiple times in the same package could indicate a problem, such as a loop or a malicious payload being injected.\n\nHowever, considering that these files are named with minified JavaScript and have hash suffixes, they could be legitimate resources. The repetition might be due to a logging issue or a normal process that's being logged multiple times. But if the same file is created multiple times by the same process without any changes, that's unusual. \n\nAnother angle: the presence of multiple entries for the same file might indicate that the process is attempting to create the file repeatedly, possibly due to an error or a malicious attempt to overwrite or inject code. However, without additional context like process arguments, parent processes, or other anomalies (like network activity or registry changes), it's hard to confirm malicious intent.\n\nOn the other hand, if these files are part of a legitimate Office update or installation, then the events might be normal. But the fact that the same file is created multiple times in the same directory could still be suspicious. \n\nConsidering all this, the logs show a pattern of repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe, which might be benign if part of a normal process, but the repetition could also indicate an anomaly. Since the classification needs to be based on the entire batch, the repeated creation of the same files in different packages might not be enough to classify as interesting unless there's a clear indicator of compromise.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, there are multiple entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files have names like word-copilot.min_... and officeaicopilot-strings.min_... with different hashes.\n\nHmm, first, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, Microsoft Office might use such helper executables for various tasks, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the fact that these files are being created in the SolutionPackages directory, which is part of Office's local storage, might be normal for updates or add-ins. But wait, the filenames include \"copilot\" and \"strings,\" which could relate to Microsoft Copilot features. However, the hashes in the filenames are unique each time, which might indicate different versions or packages. \n\nBut here's a thought: if these files are being created repeatedly by the same process, maybe there's an issue. However, looking at the paths, they are all under the user's AppData directory, which is typical for user-specific files. Also, the same file paths are logged multiple times, but maybe that's just because the event was logged multiple times for the same file creation. However, the timestamps aren't provided here, so I can't tell if they're spread out or all happening at once.\n\nAnother angle: the process name SDXHelper.exe. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. If I recall, Microsoft has a process called SDXHelper.exe related to Office, but I'm not 100% certain. If it's legitimate, then creating these files could be part of normal operations, like installing or updating add-ins. However, if this process isn't known, that might be a red flag. \n\nBut wait, the files are JavaScript files (with .js extension), which are typically used for web-based features. Microsoft Office might use these for copilot features, which are web-integrated. So maybe this is normal. However, the repeated creation of these files could be part of an update process, or maybe something else. \n\nHowever, the key point is that all the events are the same: SDXHelper.exe creating files in the same directory structure. There's no variation in the process or the files except for the hash part of the filename. That could be normal if they are different versions of the same file. But if the same file is being created multiple times, that might be an issue. However, the logs show different hashes, so maybe they are different files. \n\nBut why are there so many entries? Each line is a separate event, but they all seem to be the same action. Maybe the system is logging each file creation event, which is normal. However, if this is part of a larger pattern, like a lot of files being created in a short time, that could be suspicious. But without timestamps, I can't assess the timing. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of multiple files with similar names but different hashes might be part of a legitimate update or package installation. However, if these files are not part of any known Office update or add-in, that could be a concern. \n\nBut given the information provided, I don't see any obvious signs of malicious activity. The process seems to be creating files in a legitimate directory, and the files are JavaScript files which are common for web features. Unless there's a known malicious use of SDXHelper.exe, which I'm not aware of, this might be a false positive. \n\nHowever, the fact that the same process is creating multiple files with different hashes could be part of a larger attack, but without more context, like other events (e.g., network connections, registry changes), it's hard to tell. Since the user is asking if this batch is interesting for investigation, and considering that all events are the same and possibly legitimate, I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING.\" But I'm not entirely certain. However, the confidence level would be moderate because there's not enough information to confirm malicious intent, but the repetition and the specific process might warrant further investigation. Wait, but the user wants a classification based on the entire batch. If all these events are normal, then it's not interesting. But if there's something suspicious, like unexpected file creation by a helper process, maybe it's interesting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the files are being created in a location that's not typical for that process. But since they're in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which is part of the user's AppData, it might be okay. \n\nI think I need to conclude that without more context, these events might be legitimate, so the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence of around 0.6. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, that might be a red flag. However, I believe SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, so it's likely legitimate. Therefore, the justification is that the events are likely part of normal Office operations, hence not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, which appears to be part of normal Office add-in or feature installation\/update processes.

Maybe it's part of some software, but I should check if it's a legitimate process. Microsoft Office's directories are usually for installed components, but the filenames here look like they might be related to Office AI Copilot or some add-in. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be a red flag. \n\nWait, looking at the paths, they're in the SolutionPackages folder, which is part of Office's setup for add-ins or solutions.
