I see that there are multiple entries from two different processes: MpCmdRun.exe and git.exe.\n\nStarting with MpCmdRun.exe, it's associated with Windows Defender components being loaded. The file paths point to MpClient.dll and MpCommu.dll. These seem legitimate as they're part of the standard Windows Defender setup. There’s nothing unusual here that would raise a red flag—no signs of tampering or unexpected locations.\n\nNow, looking at git.exe entries. All these events are from the same user directory: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\semver\\\". The files being created are JavaScript files related to semver (semantic versioning). This seems like a normal operation if the user is working with Node.js modules, especially semver, which is commonly used in software development for version comparisons.\n\nThe pattern here is consistent—multiple file creations by git.exe in a node_modules directory. It's typical during npm installs or when cloning repositories. There’s no indication of malicious activity like unusual file names, locations outside the expected project structure, or attempts to execute scripts without proper context.\n\nConsidering all events together, everything aligns with legitimate user activities: using Windows Defender and working on a software project with Node.js.

The common thread here is that each one involves the process \"git.exe\" creating a file. The files being created are all within the \"node_modules\/semver\" directory, with various JavaScript files like major.js, minor.js, index.js, and some internal files.\n\nHmm, first thing I notice is that git.exe is typically associated with version control systems, specifically Git for software development. The path shown is under a user's Downloads folder, in a course named \"Qualidade de Software\" which translates to \"Software Quality.\" That suggests this might be part of a educational project or someone setting up a development environment.\n\nThe files created are all related to the 'semver' package, which I know is used for semantic versioning. Node modules are standard in JavaScript\/Node.js projects, so it makes sense that these files would be created during the setup or update of such a project. Each event shows a different file being created, but they're all within the same directory and by the same process.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual processes, no attempts to access restricted areas, and nothing out of the ordinary for someone working on a software project using Git and Node.js. The user is likely just cloning or initializing a repository that includes these semver files as part of its dependencies.\n\nSo, considering all these points, this batch doesn't seem to indicate any suspicious behavior.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first two events are about MicrosoftEdge setup.exe file creation and its time being changed. That seems normal during updates. Then there's CompatTelRunner.exe loading some DLLs, which is standard for running certain processes.\n\nNext, setup.exe creates a pipe. Pipes can be legitimate but sometimes used maliciously. I'll keep that in mind. Services.exe and special logon events are part of the system's normal operation, so those don't raise flags on their own.\n\nThere are multiple User Account Management tasks logged. These could be from account creation or access changes. Without more context, it's hard to tell if they're suspicious.\n\nThe event involving taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll is typical for scheduling tasks, which isn't concerning unless there's an unusual pattern. Svchost.exe modifying the registry might be normal for services but could also indicate malicious activity.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell command executed with -ExecutionPolicy Restricted. That caught my attention because even though it's restricted, sometimes attackers use such commands to execute scripts. The command seems to check .inf files in the Windows directory, which could be part of legitimate system checks or potentially malicious actions like installing drivers.\n\nAnother taskhostw.exe and svchost.exe events follow, maintaining a similar pattern. Powershell creates a profile data file, which is standard if it's non-interactive. The Chrome DNS query isn't suspicious on its own but adds to the baseline noise.\n\nConsidering all these together, while most events are normal system behavior, the PowerShell execution stands out as potentially malicious. However, without more context or additional signs of compromise, I'm not certain. But since there's a possible malicious script execution attempt, it's worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes events related to file creation and modification times for Microsoft Edge setup files, which could indicate tampering or unauthorized updates.

Winlogbeat is a known tool for collecting logs, so that seems normal unless it's accessing restricted areas, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries from svchost.exe setting registry values and creating files. Svchost is a legitimate process used by various services, but sometimes malware can hide under its name. The fact that there are several such events might raise some flags, but without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That sounds suspicious because Calculator isn't expected to interact with URL-related functions. This could indicate a potential exploit or unauthorized activity.\n\nLooking further, there's an instance of MsMpEng.exe loading taskschd.dll. MsMpEng is related to Windows Defender, so that seems legitimate. The taskschd DLL is part of the Task Scheduler, which is standard.\n\nI notice multiple entries from MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating and deleting files in different locations. While Edge updates are common, the specific paths here might be worth monitoring, especially if they're accessing unusual directories or files.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe loading various Defender-related files doesn't seem concerning on its own. However, there's an event where it creates a lock file in the Windows Temp directory, which is standard for processes needing exclusive access.\n\nThere are also events from conhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values. Conhost is typically used by command-line tools, and mintty is associated with Cygwin environments. While these can be legitimate, they might also be indicators of remote sessions or scripts running in non-standard environments.\n\nPutting it all together, the Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll stands out as potentially malicious because that combination doesn't align with expected behavior. The other events are mostly normal system activities, especially since many involve known processes like svchost and Defender components. However, the volume of registry changes by svchost and the edge update activity could warrant closer inspection to ensure there's no underlying issue.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains events that may indicate suspicious activity such as Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is unexpected behavior.

Git is a version control system, and when you clone a repository or update dependencies, it often downloads and extracts files into node_modules for npm packages. The semver package is related to semantic versioning, which makes sense because it's part of the node_modules structure.\n\nLooking at all these events together, they're all file creation events from git.exe in the same directory.

Let me start by looking at the structure of each event.\n\nEach JSON object represents an event with three main fields: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always \"git.exe,\" which suggests Git-related activity. The task in the winlog field is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate),\" indicating that a file was created. The file paths all point to locations within a directory named \"node_modules\" under a user's Downloads folder.\n\nI notice that each event creates a different file, such as LICENSE, README.md, package.json, and others typical of npm packages. Since Git is involved, this could be part of cloning a repository or installing Node.js modules. The repeated creation of files in node_modules suggests that this might be during a project setup or an update.\n\nI should consider the context. If these events occurred during legitimate development work, they wouldn't raise any red flags. There's no evidence of unusual file names, access times outside normal working hours, or signs of tampering. The pattern is consistent with standard Git and npm operations.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that there aren't any hidden indicators. Are these files being created in an unexpected location? The path seems like a typical project directory on a user's machine. There are no executable files or scripts being written here; it's mainly text files and package metadata.\n\nAnother angle: is the volume of events unusual? Nine file creation events might be normal during an install or clone, but without knowing the baseline for this system, it's hard to say. But given that each event involves a different file in node_modules, it aligns with standard behavior.\n\nI should also think about potential malicious activities. Malware typically doesn't create so many files in a structured manner like this. It would more likely perform actions like unauthorized access or deletion rather than creating numerous files in a predictable pattern.\n\nConsidering all these points, the events don't exhibit signs of malicious behavior.

When you clone a repository or install dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager), it's normal for the system to create files and directories. The node_modules folder is where npm stores the packages and their associated files, including modules like sshpk, which I recall is related to secure shell key management.\n\nEach event shows that git.exe created a different file within the sshpk module. Since this is part of a typical development setup, these events are likely just part of installing or updating dependencies. There's nothing unusual about git creating files in a node_modules directory during such operations.\n\nI also consider whether these activities could be indicative of malicious behavior. However, since they're all within a user's downloads folder and under a standard project structure, it doesn't raise any red flags.

The task in each case is \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate\". The files being created are various .json, .js, .d.ts, license, and readme.md files located inside different node_modules folders.\n\nHmm, I recognize that node_modules is a common directory in Node.js projects where third-party libraries are stored. Git.exe is typically used for version control, so when someone clones or updates a repository, git might create new files or directories as part of the checkout process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to specific modules like \"sshpk\", \"string-width\", \"strip-ansi\", and \"strip-final-newline\". These seem to be standard Node.js packages.

That tells me that whatever is happening here is related to Git operations. I know that Git is a version control system used for managing source code, so it's pretty common in development environments.\n\nThe task field says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means each event is about creating a file. So, these are all file creation events triggered by the Git process. That makes sense because when you clone a repository or perform operations like 'git pull' or 'git fetch', Git needs to download and create new files in your local directory.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\". This seems to be a user's Downloads folder on their Windows machine. The specific path includes folders like 'node_modules', which is a common directory in Node.js projects where third-party modules are stored.\n\nBreaking down the files being created:\n- There are several entries under \"signal-exit\", including LICENSE.txt, README.md, index.js, etc.\n- Similarly, there are files under \"slice-ansi\" and \"sshpk\".\n- Each of these has various subfiles like .travis.yml, Jenkinsfile, LICENSE, README.md, and some executable scripts in the bin folder.\n\nGiven that all these files are part of what seems to be a Node.js project setup (judging by 'node_modules'), it looks like someone is setting up or working on a software project.

Interesting here would mean there's something unusual or potentially malicious going on. Not interesting would mean it's normal user activity that doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nLooking at the events, they're all file creations by Git.exe in a standard project directory structure. This is exactly what you'd expect when someone is cloning a repository, updating dependencies, or pulling changes from a remote repository. The files created are typical for a Node.js module setup—licences, READMEs, source code, and configuration files.\n\nI don't see any signs of suspicious activity here. There's no indication that these files are being accessed in an unusual way, nor are there any indicators of malicious processes or file hashes associated with known threats. The fact that it's all within a 'node_modules' directory suggests this is part of a legitimate development environment.\n\nThe confidence level would be high because the events fit a clear pattern of normal Git and npm activity.

Well, repeated file creations by git.exe in a node_modules directory don't raise any red flags. It's standard behavior when managing dependencies for a software project. There's no indication of access to sensitive files, failed login attempts, or other signs of malicious activity.\n\nI should also consider the context: this is happening within a user's Downloads folder under \"inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\".
