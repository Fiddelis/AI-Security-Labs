The filenames are variations of \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\" with different hashes.\n\nFirst thought: SDXHelper.exe is probably a legitimate tool since it's related to Microsoft Office and file handling. These events seem like normal operations where files are being created in an offline cache or similar location, which is typical for software updates or package resources.\n\nThe same process creating multiple files isn't inherently suspicious unless it's doing so excessively beyond usual behavior.

The paths vary slightly but follow a pattern with similar filenames. Since they're all being created by the same process and in a Microsoft Office directory, this might be part of normal operations, especially since the files are JavaScript resources which could be related to features like Excel Copilot.\n\nI should consider whether these events indicate malicious behavior. SDXHelper.exe doesn't ring any immediate bells as a known malware. The act of creating multiple JS files during an Office process sounds legitimate, perhaps for loading different components or scripts needed by the application.\n\nThe fact that each file is created twice with similar names suggests it's part of a standard installation or update routine where redundant steps are taken. Alternatively, maybe there was a delay in writing the files, so they're retried. Either way, this doesn't seem unusual for legitimate software behavior.\n\nI don't see any signs of suspicious activity like unauthorized access, changes to system files, or attempts to execute code outside the expected paths.

So, it's not immediately suspicious, but I should check what this process does normally.\n\nThe task in each event is \"File created\" with the rule \"FileCreate\", which means these are just standard file creation events.

That makes me think it's a legitimate application since it's consistent across all events.\n\nLooking at the task in each event, they're all about file creation (rule: FileCreate). So, the system is logging that files are being created. The paths point to various JavaScript files inside the Office Solution Packages directory for \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\". These look like resource files related to Excel's Copilot feature, which I know is a legitimate part of Microsoft Office.\n\nWhat catches my attention is the repetition: each event is almost identical except for the file path. There are multiple entries with different filenames, but they all follow a similar naming convention and reside in the same directory. This repetition makes me think that these might be generated by a script or an automated process, perhaps part of an update mechanism or cache clearing.\n\nI also note that the user is \"fiddelis\", which seems like a regular username, nothing suspicious there. The files are located under the AppData Local folder, which is standard for application data storage, especially for Office applications.\n\nConsidering the nature of these events, file creation logs alone aren't typically malicious unless they're part of a larger pattern of suspicious activity. Here, since all the events come from the same process and target known legitimate files, there's no indication of any unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\n\nI should also think about whether multiple file creations in this directory are normal. From what I know, applications often create temporary files or cache data upon startup or during updates. So, it's plausible that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is responsible for generating these files as part of its operation.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether the filenames look like they could be related to malicious activities, such as encoding them in a way to avoid detection, but all the filenames here seem to follow a predictable pattern without any obvious signs of obfuscation or suspicious naming conventions.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to keep an eye on file creation events, especially from processes you don't recognize, \"SDXHelper.exe\" seems legitimate and its activity here appears normal.

Each one has a unique hash in their names. Maybe they're part of an update process where multiple strings files are being deployed or cached. Office add-ins often have such structures for localization or feature updates.\n\nHowever, since all the events are from the same process and only involve file creation without any associated permissions changes or network activity mentioned, it's less likely to be malicious. If these were part of a wider range of activities like writing to unexpected locations, changing system settings, or communicating over the network, I'd be more concerned.\n\nAnother point is that \"SDXHelper.exe\" doesn't immediately ring a bell as a known malicious process. It sounds like something related to Office add-ins or updates. If this were a well-known malware, it would probably show up in more obvious ways.\n\nBut let me think about possible red flags. The fact that the same process is creating multiple files could be part of legitimate operations, especially if the application is updating or initializing resources. However, excessive file creation without reason might indicate something suspicious, but I don't have enough context to say for sure.\n\nAlso, all these events are happening in a specific folder under Office's SolutionPackages. That's a standard place for such components, so it doesn't seem out of the ordinary.\n\nI should also consider if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known legitimate process. A quick mental note—yes, I recall that SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office, handling things like add-ins and customizations. So this activity aligns with what's expected from such processes.\n\nIn summary, while the repeated file creations could be concerning at first glance, they seem to fit within normal operations for an Office-related process. The duplication of some files might just be part of how updates or resources are managed in the application.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events show multiple file creation actions by \"SDXHelper.exe\" within a standard Microsoft Office directory. These appear to be legitimate as SDXHelper is known to handle Office add-ins and related resources.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events from SDXHelper.exe in a known Office directory, likely part of normal operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

The first thing I notice is that every event has the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's interesting because it suggests all these activities are coming from the same source.\n\nLooking deeper into each event, they all have a task labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So, this means the system is logging file creation events. The files being created are located in a specific path under the user's AppData directory. The exact paths vary slightly but follow a pattern like \"excel-copilot-strings_*.js\". Each filename seems to have a unique hash-like suffix, which probably differentiates them.\n\nI'm thinking about what \"SDXHelper.exe\" is. It might be an Office-related process since the path includes Microsoft's SolutionPackages directory. These files are likely related to Excel's Copilot features, as indicated by \"excel-copilot-strings\". So, these events are part of normal Office operations, specifically when using Excel with Copilot enabled.\n\nThe repetitive nature of these events—each one creating a new file but under the same parent directory and following a naming convention—doesn't raise any immediate red flags. It doesn't look like there's any irregularity in the process name or the files being created. The fact that each event is similar suggests it's part of a legitimate process, perhaps during an update or when certain features are loaded.\n\nI also consider whether multiple file creations could be indicative of malicious activity, such as creating temporary files or dropping malicious scripts. However, given the context (Microsoft Office) and the naming pattern, this seems more like standard operating procedure for Office applications, especially with features like Copilot that might require several resources to load.\n\nThere's no evidence in these logs of access to restricted areas, attempts to modify system settings, or other signs of malicious behavior. The files are being created in a user-specific directory, which is typical for application data. Additionally, the fact that all events are from the same process and follow predictable patterns makes me lean towards this being non-malicious.\n\nI also think about how attackers might obfuscate their activities, but these file names are quite clear and seem related to known components of Excel's functionality. If there were malicious scripts or files, they'd likely have different naming conventions or locations.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to monitor for unusual activity, in this case, the events appear to be part of a legitimate process within Microsoft Office.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of log events. So, I'm seeing a JSONL file with multiple entries. Each entry is a JSON object representing some system activity.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal because winlogbeat is likely a log shipping tool or part of an ELK stack setup. It's probably just creating configuration files during its operation. No red flags here.\n\nThen, I notice that most of the other events are all coming from SDXHelper.exe. Each event is a \"File created\" task under winlog, and they're all pointing to similar file paths in the Microsoft Office OfflineFiles directory. The filenames have varying GUID-like strings, which might indicate different language packs or resource files for Excel's Copilot feature.\n\nHmm, multiple entries with the same process creating similar files. I should consider whether this is typical behavior for SDXHelper.exe. Since it's part of Microsoft Office, and given that these are likely related to the Copilot feature, which requires various resources, this seems like legitimate activity. It could be during an update or installation phase where multiple resource files are being downloaded or extracted.\n\nI'm trying to think if there's any indication of malicious behavior here. Are there too many file creations in a short period? The logs show several events with the same process and similar file paths, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's suspicious. It could just be how Office handles its resources, especially for features like Copilot which might require multiple files.\n\nAnother angle: are these files being created in unexpected locations or with unusual names? The paths look standard for Microsoft Office's OfflineFiles directory. The filenames seem to follow a pattern with GUIDs and \"strings\" appended, which is typical for resource files. No signs of encoding that would hint at malicious payload.\n\nI should also check if the process SDXHelper.exe is known for such behavior. From what I recall, it's associated with Office add-ins and helper services. So multiple file creations here wouldn't be unusual unless there's an anomaly in frequency or file paths.\n\nIs there any chance of persistence mechanisms or lateral movement? The files are all being created in the same directory under AppData, which is a common place for application data, so that doesn't raise flags on its own.\n\nCould this indicate a configuration issue instead of malicious activity? Maybe winlogbeat is misconfigured and creating unnecessary files. But without more context, it's hard to say, but that would likely be a lower priority than potential security issues.\n\nPutting it all together: one normal log from a log shipping tool and multiple legitimate file creations by an Office helper process for Copilot resources. No signs of unauthorized access, strange processes, or unusual file activities. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file creation activity by known system processes related to log shipping and Microsoft Office features.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the data structure: Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The keys are \"process,\" \"winlog,\" and \"file.\" \n\nThe process name in all these events is \"SDXHelper.exe.\" I know that this might be a legitimate Windows process, possibly related to system diagnostics or something similar. But sometimes, malicious actors can disguise their processes with names like this.\n\nNext, the winlog field shows that each event is a \"File created\" task under the rule \"FileCreate.\" So these are file creation events. That's pretty standard and not inherently suspicious on its own, as legitimate processes create files all the time.\n\nLooking at the file paths: All of them are located in the same directory under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. The filenames have a pattern like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_{hash}.js\". This looks like JavaScript files with different hashes, possibly related to language strings for an Office add-in or similar application.\n\nI notice that each file path is slightly different because of the varying hash suffixes. However, this could be normal if these are dynamically generated or cached files. For instance, web applications often create unique cache files to store temporary data, which might explain multiple identical events with different filenames.\n\nBut why are there so many duplicates? Each event is almost identical except for the filename. This repetition might indicate that SDXHelper.exe is creating several files in quick succession, perhaps during a process like unpacking an Office package or generating cache entries. Legitimate software updates or installations can cause multiple file creations as part of their setup.\n\nIs there any red flag here? The path structure seems nested and specific to user data, which isn't unusual. The fact that all events are from the same process and involve file creation doesn't immediately raise a warning unless we have context about what SDXHelper.exe is supposed to do.\n\nHowever, since the event types are repetitive and don't show any signs of other activities like deletion or access patterns beyond creation, there's no indication of malicious intent in these logs alone. They could simply be part of a normal software operation.\n\nI should also consider whether multiple identical events could be an attempt to flood logs, but given that each file is unique, it's more likely related to legitimate operations rather than an attack vector.\n\nIn summary, without additional context suggesting that SDXHelper.exe is malicious or that these files are being used for something nefarious, the batch doesn't seem interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. The events are consistent with normal file creation activities by a known system process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by SDXHelper.exe, likely related to legitimate Office package operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, looking at the events provided, each one is a JSON object representing an event where \"SDXHelper.exe\" creates a file. The paths in each event are all under the same directory, and the filenames vary slightly but follow a pattern with hashes.\n\nFirst off, I notice that the process name is consistent across all events—every single log entry comes from \"SDXHelper.exe\". That tells me it's likely the same application or process creating these files. The task in each event is also the same: \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So, no variation there either.\n\nNow, looking at the file paths, they all point to a directory within the user's AppData folder, specifically under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. That seems normal because Office applications often store various resources and packages in such locations. The naming of the files includes \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by different hashes. This suggests that these are likely string resource files for the AI Copilot feature in Office.\n\nI think about why this might be happening. It could be part of a legitimate update or installation process where multiple resources are being written. The repetition and consistent naming make me lean towards this being expected behavior rather than malicious activity. Malware often shows more varied file operations across different directories, whereas here everything is contained within a known Office-related folder.\n\nThere's also the number of events to consider—16 in total. While that might seem like a lot, if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is part of an update process or regularly runs to create necessary files, this could be normal. Plus, each file has a unique hash suffix, which doesn't raise red flags for me.\n\nI should also think about whether these hashes are known malicious indicators. Since they follow a standard naming convention and aren't obviously suspicious (like names associated with known malware), it's less likely they're part of an attack. Moreover, the fact that the same process is creating all these files without any deviations in the event data makes me more confident this isn't something to worry about.\n\nConsidering all these points—consistent process name, file creation task type, and legitimate-looking file paths—I don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. It's probably just Office doing its thing with resource files.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in a known Microsoft Office directory, likely related to legitimate updates or resources.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst off, every event has the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's interesting because it suggests that whatever is happening here is coming from the same source or related process each time.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, the task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So, each of these events is logging a file creation. The exact same action repeated multiple times might not be suspicious on its own, but the number and pattern could matter.\n\nNow, looking at the file paths in each event:\n\n- They all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\...\"\n\nIt's the same user, \"fiddelis\", and the same path structure each time. The specific files being created are various \".js\" files with different hashes in their names.\n\nI notice that some file paths repeat:\n- For example, the path ending with \"_01b8fae0e347988f62adc5207c7a379b.js\" appears twice.\n- Similarly, others like \"_028115e67b5197aac9e7cacf78e95a8c.js\" also repeat.\n\nThis repetition makes me think: Is this normal? How often does a legitimate process create the same file multiple times?\n\nSDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Office, probably handling some package resources. It's possible that during updates or installations, multiple files are being written sequentially. But seeing so many identical events in such a short span might be unusual.\n\nI'm also considering whether these file creations are part of a legitimate update process. However, the fact that each file creation is logged as an event with the exact same structure and only varying in the filename makes me wonder if there's something more to it.\n\nIs SDXHelper.exe known for creating multiple files like this? I should check if this activity is typical. If not, then having 14 events of the same type might be a red flag.\n\nAnother angle: could this be part of an installation or update process where several files are being written one after another? It's possible, but usually, these processes don't generate so many identical log entries unless something is off.\n\nAlso, looking at the file names: they all have the same prefix \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a long hash. This suggests that these might be parts of a larger file or maybe chunks being written sequentially. That's not typical for legitimate processes, which usually write entire files in one go rather than in multiple small writes.\n\nThe user account is \"fiddelis,\" which seems like a standard Windows username, so no immediate red flags there.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple identical file creation events from the same process, writing similar files into the same directory. While not necessarily malicious on their own, the sheer number and repetition could indicate something unusual, such as an attempted persistence mechanism or part of a larger attack vector.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it's unexpected behavior that might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events from the same process, potentially indicating unusual activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

That's interesting because it suggests that whatever is happening here is related to this specific executable.\n\nNext, all these events are Windows log entries with the task being \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate\". So, each event is indicating that a file was created. The files in question have paths like \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\[some GUID]\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_[hash].js\".\n\nI'm noticing a pattern here: the same process is creating multiple files, each with different hashes appended to the filename. The file paths are all within an Office Solution Packages directory. This makes me think that these could be related to some kind of plugin or add-on for Microsoft Office, as those often store their resources in such locations.\n\nThe fact that there are duplicate events—each file creation is happening twice except maybe the last one? Wait, looking again, each unique hash appears exactly twice except possibly one. That might just be how many files were created during this time period. It's not necessarily suspicious on its own, but it's something to note.\n\nNow, considering that \"SDXHelper.exe\" sounds like a legitimate Windows process, perhaps part of the Office suite or an associated tool. Microsoft Office does use such helper processes for various tasks. The act of creating files in the OfflineFiles directory suggests these are cache files or resources used by the Office AI Copilot feature, as indicated by \"officeaicopilot-strings\".\n\nSo, putting this together: multiple instances of a legitimate process creating files in an expected location related to Microsoft Office's features. There doesn't seem to be any signs of malicious behavior here. No unusual paths, no unexpected file types beyond .js which fits the context, and the process is known.\n\nHowever, I'm wondering why there are so many identical events. Is it normal for this process to create multiple files in quick succession? Maybe during an update or a cache refresh. Since all events are consistent and don't indicate any deviations from expected behavior, it's likely not concerning.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of log spamming, but since each event is legitimate and there's no deviation from standard operations, that seems unlikely.

My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the events, each one has three main parts: process information, Windows log details, and file information.\n\nThe \"process\" field shows that all events are created by \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's a consistent process name across all entries. I'm trying to recall if SDXHelper is known for anything malicious or not. From what I remember, it might be related to some system tools or maybe Office-related processes, like handling updates or package installations.\n\nThe Windows log task in each event is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So the events are all about files being created. The exact file path varies slightly in each event but follows a pattern. For example, the paths are under the user's AppData Local folder within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory. Specifically, they're in the OfflineFiles subdirectory and have filenames like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by different hash-like suffixes.\n\nI'm noticing that each file path is unique but follows a predictable naming convention. The process creating these files is the same across all events, so it's not something unexpected from a different process. \n\nNow, considering if this batch should be classified as interesting or not. Since all events are created by the same process and involve legitimate-looking file operations within an expected directory structure for Office packages, there doesn't seem to be any immediate signs of malicious activity. It could just be part of normal Office operations, perhaps during updates or cache creation.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether multiple FileCreate events in a short time might indicate something suspicious, like rapid file generation which could be part of a data exfiltration or installation process. But without more context, such as timestamps showing very close together creation times or unusual file sizes, it's hard to say definitively. \n\nAnother point is the path structure. The files are in \"OfflineFiles\", which might be related to Office's offline content, so legitimate processes would create these files when necessary. If this were a malicious process, I'd expect perhaps more varied file names, different parent directories, or other anomalies.\n\nAlso, all events share the same rule name for the Windows log task, \"FileCreate\". That's consistent with standard logging practices and doesn't raise flags on its own.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to keep an eye on process activity, especially repeated writes to the filesystem, in this case, there's no evidence pointing towards malicious behavior.

All the events are JSON objects and they each have similar structures. Let me try to parse through them one by one.\n\nFirst off, each event has a \"process\" field indicating it's \"SDXHelper.exe\". That seems like a legitimate Windows process name, possibly related to system diagnostics or maybe some office software since I see Microsoft in the path later on.\n\nNext, looking at the \"winlog\" field, every single event says the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So it's logging that a file was created. That seems normal, but I wonder why there are so many such events in a row.\n\nThe \"file\" path is where things get interesting. All the files being logged are under:\n\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\\\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\\\PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\...\"\n\nThe filenames all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by different hashes. For example, \"87e25f4a4a1edc118c864f0b023b2ecf.js\" and others.\n\nSo, breaking this down: these are JavaScript files being created in an Office-related directory under the user's AppData folder. The same file path is repeated across all events, just different filenames. It looks like multiple JS files are being generated with unique hashes each time.\n\nNow, why would this be happening? Let me think about possible scenarios. If SDXHelper.exe is part of a legitimate Office update or installation process, creating several JavaScript files might make sense—maybe it's downloading or extracting some resources. Alternatively, if these files were created rapidly in succession and have suspicious hashes, they could indicate malicious activity, like dropping multiple files as part of an infection process.\n\nBut wait, the fact that all events are from SDXHelper.exe makes me think about what this process does. If I recall correctly, Office add-ins or components sometimes run under such names to handle updates or package resources. The path structure also aligns with how Microsoft packages might store their offline files for features like AI Copilot mentioned in the filenames.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether these files are expected or not. Are multiple JS files being created at once normal during an Office operation? If yes, then this batch might not be suspicious. But if the number of files is unusually high or they're created by a process that's not typically associated with such operations, it could be concerning.\n\nAnother angle: looking for repeated file creation events in a short period. In cybersecurity, sudden spikes in file activity can indicate malicious behavior, especially when combined with unknown processes. Here, there are 15 events of the same type, which might not be too alarming on their own but could still warrant investigation if they don't fit usual patterns.\n\nI should also check for any anomalies in the hashes. If these JS files have been flagged as malicious elsewhere or resemble known malware components, that would increase the suspicion level. But without knowing the specifics of each hash, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because of the repetitive file creation events by the same process in a specific directory. While it might be part of normal operations, the volume and consistency could indicate something more nefarious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events from SDXHelper.exe targeting an Office-related directory suggest potential unusual activity that may warrant investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes. I need to classify it as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING,\" provide a concise justification, and give a confidence score between 0 and 1.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of each event. Each JSON object has three main keys: process, winlog, and file. The process key contains the name \"SDXHelper.exe.\" The winlog key indicates that the task is related to a file creation event (specifically, \"File created\" with a rule named \"FileCreate\"). The file key includes the path of the file that was created.\n\nLooking at all the events, they are almost identical. Each one has the same process name and the same file path structure, just varying in the last part of the filename. For example:\n\n- officeaicopilot-strings.min_6bce757cc270c1ada438b863338d0d2f.js\n- officeaicopilot-strings.min_6c878e617b5cdf6ec02250c4701fa7ea.js\n- And so on.\n\nI notice that each file is located in the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. This path seems typical for application data, possibly related to Microsoft Office or a similar software's package resources. The naming pattern of the files suggests they are JavaScript resource files with unique hashes at the end.\n\nNow, considering each event is a file creation by SDXHelper.exe, I need to assess whether this batch is unusual. SDXHelper.exe sounds like it might be part of a legitimate software setup or update process. Microsoft Office often uses such helpers for installing or managing components.\n\nThe fact that multiple files are being created in quick succession with similar names could indicate a normal installation or update procedure. However, if these files were created outside the expected locations or had suspicious content, they might raise red flags. But from what's given, the paths and filenames don't look malicious at first glance.\n\nI should also consider the frequency of events. There are 15 entries in this batch, all occurring within a short time frame, likely during an update or installation process. Legitimate software updates often create multiple files quickly when extracting or installing resources.\n\nAnother point is that each event is logged as a file creation with the same rule (FileCreate). This consistency suggests it's part of a standard logging process for such operations rather than something nefarious trying to hide its tracks.\n\nI might be concerned if these files were created by an unexpected process, but SDXHelper.exe appears related to Microsoft Office. I can't recall any specific malicious activity associated with this name off the top of my head, but it's possible without more context.\n\nThe file paths don't show any signs of being in system directories or areas where malware typically hides (like the Windows directory or Program Files). Instead, they're in a user-specific AppData folder under Office resources, which is a usual place for application data.\n\nMoreover, each file has a .js extension, indicating JavaScript files. These could be part of web-based resources that the Office suite uses, perhaps for AI features like Copilot mentioned in some filenames. This makes sense as an update or cache of such resources.\n\nIn summary, while I can't rule out all possibilities without deeper analysis, the surface-level details suggest these are legitimate file creation events during a software update or installation process. There's no immediate red flag indicating malicious activity, and the consistency across events supports this conclusion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by SDXHelper.exe for JavaScript resources in expected locations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

My task is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. The final output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of each event. Each JSON object has three main keys: process, winlog, and file. The process key contains the name \"SDXHelper.exe\", which is consistent across all events. The winlog indicates that a file was created (rule: FileCreate). The file path varies but follows a specific pattern.\n\nI notice that each event is almost identical except for the file paths. All files are under the same directory, specifically in the OfflineFiles folder within SolutionPackages. The filenames seem to follow a naming convention with \"min_\" and various suffixes like b073bf860080b51dd95889317aadf7d4.js and others.\n\nMy first thought is that SDXHelper.exe is likely a legitimate Windows process. It's commonly associated with Microsoft Office, possibly related to updates or package management. The creation of multiple JavaScript files under the OfflineFiles directory suggests these might be cached files for offline use in Office applications, such as Word or Excel, to improve performance when not connected to the internet.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, although they aren't provided here, if all events occurred within a short timeframe, it could indicate that these are part of an update or installation process. The repetition of file creation events with different filenames might be due to multiple files being downloaded or extracted during an Office update.\n\nI should consider whether this activity is normal. Legitimate software updates often involve creating new files in such directories. However, the presence of multiple identical events could raise a flag if it's outside the usual update cycle. But given that these are all under a known Microsoft-related directory and the process name is consistent with Office components, it seems less likely to be malicious.\n\nTo further assess, I might cross-reference SDXHelper.exe against known threat intelligence databases or analyze its behavior in more detail. If this process is part of standard operations, then creating multiple files isn't suspicious. But if there's any deviation from expected patterns—like unusual file sizes, unexpected locations, or execution outside normal hours—it could warrant closer examination.\n\nAnother angle is the number of events. There are 14 identical entries in a row, each creating a new JavaScript file. This clustering might be due to an automated process updating multiple files at once. Such behavior is typical during software updates but could also be indicative of malicious activity trying to write multiple files quickly. However, without additional context like network traffic or other log entries, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI should also consider the user context. The file paths point to a user profile (C:\\Users\\fiddelis), which is standard for per-user application data. If this were a high-privilege account or if these files were being accessed by multiple processes, that might be more concerning. But as it stands, the files are in an expected location for Office-related data.\n\nLooking at the file names again, they all start with \"officeaicopilot-\", which suggests they're related to AI Copilot features in Office. These features require such resources to function offline. So the creation of these files is likely part of enabling those functionalities.\n\nIn terms of confidence, while there's a slight possibility that this could be part of an adversarial activity mimicking legitimate traffic, the consistency and location strongly point towards normal operations. Unless there are other indicators like failed file operations or deviations in timestamps, I would lean towards this being non-malicious.\n\nFinally, weighing all these factors—consistent process name, known Microsoft-related directory, plausible explanation as cached files for Office features—the batch doesn't seem to warrant further investigation. Therefore, the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in a known Microsoft Office directory suggest normal update or cache activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they are interesting or not. Let me start by looking at the details.\n\nEach event is a JSON object with three main parts: process information, Windows log task, and file details. The process name in all events is \"SDXHelper.exe\". This seems familiar; I think it's related to Microsoft Office updates or settings. \n\nThe Windows log task consistently says \"File created\" with the same rule identifier. So each event indicates that a file was created by SDXHelper.exe.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to locations within the user's AppData folder under Microsoft Office. Specifically, they're in the SolutionPackages directory, which I believe is where Office stores add-ins and other solution packages. The filenames have a pattern like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" or \"word-copilot.min_...\", followed by various hashes. These seem to be JavaScript files related to AI features in Office, possibly Copilot.\n\nNow, considering the number of events: there are 14 entries. Each seems to involve creating different JS files. The repetition might suggest that these files were created multiple times or during different sessions. Since they're within an expected directory for Office-related packages, this activity is likely normal.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known process. A quick mental recall tells me it's associated with managing Office solutions and updates. So its file creation activities in the specified paths are part of standard operations.\n\nThe fact that each event is identical except for the file path makes me think this isn't malicious activity, which usually shows more variation. Instead, this looks like legitimate operations by Office components updating or initializing AI features.\n\nTherefore, while it's not unusual to see multiple file creations, especially in a batch from the same process, there's no evidence here of anything suspicious. The files are where they're expected, and the naming conventions align with known Microsoft Office structures.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access, encryption, or other red flags. All events fit within normal user activity related to software updates and feature installations.\n\nIn conclusion, this batch doesn't raise any red flags for malicious behavior. It's likely just part of the regular operation of Microsoft Office components.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe within expected Microsoft Office directories, likely related to legitimate updates or AI feature initialization.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I've been given a set of system log entries in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event. My task is to analyze all these events together and determine if the batch as a whole is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at each event, they all seem similar. The process name is consistently \"SDXHelper.exe\". The type of event is always a file creation, according to the winlog field. The files being created are JavaScript files located in various paths under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. Each path has a unique GUID-like identifier for the package and specific filenames with hashes at the end.\n\nI notice that some of these file paths repeat. For example, \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_d2a01ab8f8d7605cd831c73c13f130ca.js\" appears twice, and similar duplicates are present for other filenames. This repetition makes me think that these might be legitimate actions by the Office software or a related update process.\n\nThe fact that all events come from the same process and involve creating files in standard locations suggests it's part of normal operations. \"SDXHelper.exe\" sounds like it could be a system or Microsoft-related tool, possibly handling updates or package installations. The paths point to \"OfflineFiles\", which might indicate cached content for offline use, a common practice for productivity applications.\n\nI also consider the possibility of malicious activity. However, without evidence of deviations from expected behavior—such as unusual file locations, unexpected processes accessing them, or signs of unauthorized access—it's hard to flag these events as suspicious. The consistent nature and repetition suggest routine operations rather than an attack.\n\nIn summary, while it's important to monitor such activities, especially when dealing with system files, there's nothing in this batch that stands out as malicious or unusual. The repeated file creations by a known process likely serve legitimate purposes related to Office functionality.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in expected locations, likely part of normal Office operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. All the entries have the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task is consistently a file creation event under the rule \"FileCreate\". Each event shows that a file was created in specific paths within the Microsoft Office OfflineFiles directory.\n\nHmm, so first, what's SDXHelper.exe? I'm not immediately sure, but I can try to recall. It sounds like it might be related to system or office applications. Maybe part of Office's setup or update process?\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to locations within the \"Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\" directory. The filenames are variations of \"word-copilot.min\" and \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\", followed by different hashes. These seem like JavaScript files, possibly related to Office's AI features or Copilot functionality.\n\nGiven that these are file creation events from a single process creating multiple JS files in an Office-related directory, it might be part of normal software operations. When Microsoft Office updates or installs new features, it might create such files offline for use when the application is run without internet access.\n\nBut wait, why so many files? There are several entries with different hashes—could these be incremental updates or different language versions? Or perhaps they're temporary files being written during an update process. Since all events are from the same process and in a known Microsoft directory, it's less likely to be malicious activity like ransomware or unauthorized access.\n\nI should also consider whether repeated file creation could indicate something suspicious, but in this case, the files are within expected locations for Office components. Malicious actors often target well-known directories, but here, the naming aligns with legitimate software functions.\n\nAdditionally, looking at each event, they all follow a similar pattern without any anomalies like unexpected paths or execution logs alongside file creation. There's no evidence of other actions such as deletions, modifications to system files, or network activities that would raise red flags.\n\nSo, putting it together: these events are likely part of normal Office operations, specifically related to the installation or update of AI features (like Copilot). Therefore, they don't indicate malicious behavior and aren't particularly interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in the Microsoft Office OfflineFiles directory.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events, and all the JSON objects are pretty similar. Each one has a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\", a file creation event under winlog, and specific file paths.\n\nFirst off, SDXHelper.exe doesn't ring any bells as malicious to me. It seems like it's related to Microsoft Office or something legitimate because of the path structure in the files being created.\n\nLooking at the file paths: they're all inside the AppData folder, which is a common spot for applications to store data. The specific paths mention \"Microsoft\", \"Office\", and \"SolutionPackages\". These are standard locations for Office-related package resources.\n\nThe filenames have hashes or random-looking strings, but given that these are offline files for copilot in Word and Office AI Copilot Chat, they're probably part of legitimate updates or cached content. There's no indication of anything suspicious like executable files being created or writes to system directories.\n\nAlso, I notice some duplicate entries—same paths appearing multiple times. This could just be the application creating these files repeatedly or during different sessions, which is normal behavior rather than malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together, there's nothing here that stands out as unusual or indicative of a security threat.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each event is a JSON object with details about a file creation task done by the process SDXHelper.exe. The first thing that stands out is that all these events are identical in structure and content, just different file paths each time.\n\nI notice that the same executable, SDXHelper.exe, is creating multiple files in specific locations within the user's AppData directory under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The file names vary slightly but seem to follow a pattern with UUID-like prefixes and hashes as suffixes. These files are JavaScript (.js) files related to \"officeaicopilot\" and \"word-copilot,\" which makes me think they might be part of some legitimate software update or package installation.\n\nHowever, I'm also considering the possibility that repeated file creation by the same process could indicate something suspicious. For instance, if an application is generating numerous files quickly, it might be a sign of malicious activity like creating temporary files for persistence or dropping payloads. But in this case, all events look consistent—same source process, same task type, and similar file structures.\n\nI check the file paths more closely. The locations seem standard for Office-related packages, which suggests that these could be legitimate operations during an update or installation of add-ins. Additionally, the naming conventions with hashes might indicate static resources being stored locally, which is common in software distribution to ensure consistent files across different instances.\n\nAnother angle is the frequency and volume of events. There are multiple entries creating files, each under a specific package ID and within OfflineFiles. This could be part of a normal process where Office is downloading or caching resources for offline use. If this happened once or twice, it might not raise flags, but having so many similar events makes me question if the system is behaving normally.\n\nI also consider whether SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. A quick mental check tells me that I'm not immediately recalling it as malicious. It's possible that this is part of Microsoft Office's setup or update mechanism. But since all these files are being created in a loop, there's a slight concern about resource exhaustion or unintended behavior.\n\nTaking into account the lack of other anomalies and the consistent nature of each event, I'm leaning towards the batch not being particularly suspicious on its own. The justification is that it appears to be legitimate file creation as part of an Office package update process.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe, which appears to be related to Microsoft Office package updates.
