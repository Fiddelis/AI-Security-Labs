The process name is always Dism.exe, which stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool in Windows. That's legitimate software used by IT pros for managing Windows images.\n\nThe winlog field consistently reports \"File Executable Detected\" with the same rule ID every time. This indicates that the system detected an executable file being accessed or executed. However, since Dism.exe is a known legitimate process, it's not unusual for it to interact with various files, including DLLs.\n\nLooking at the file paths, all of them are in a temporary directory under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp followed by different provider names like DmiProvider.dll.mui, FolderProvider.dll.mui, etc. These seem to be part of language-specific resources or components used by Windows for deployment purposes. The .mui extension suggests they're resource files, which are typically not executable but contain localized strings and other non-executable data.\n\nSince all events involve the same process and similar file accesses, there's no indication of varied or suspicious behavior across different processes or locations. Additionally, Dism.exe is a well-known tool, so its activity alone doesn't raise red flags unless it's doing something out of the ordinary.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, most events are from powershell.exe. That catches my attention because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The events show various operations like ImageLoad, ProcessAccess, FileCreate, and PipeCreated. These actions can be part of normal scripting but could also indicate something suspicious.\n\nI notice the command line in one event: it's executing powershell.exe with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. That might limit what scripts can do, but sometimes attackers use such policies to evade certain detections while still performing malicious tasks. The script is checking for specific .inf files and looking for a particular pattern. This could be part of reconnaissance or trying to access sensitive information.\n\nLooking at the files loaded by PowerShell, they're all system-related DLLs, which isn't unusual on its own. However, the fact that so many are being loaded in quick succession might be a red flag. Malware often injects into processes and loads various modules, so multiple ImageLoad events could indicate such activity.\n\nThere's also a file creation event for a .psm1 script in the Temp directory. Temporary PowerShell scripts can be part of malicious activities, especially if they're created by external processes like powershell.exe. This might suggest that a script is being generated or dropped during execution, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there are pipe creations and process accesses, which can be used for inter-process communication. Attackers might use pipes to create隐蔽 channels between different malicious processes, making it harder to detect their activities.\n\nWhile some of these actions could be legitimate (like system administration scripts), the combination—especially the PowerShell execution with specific command-line arguments, multiple file loads, and temporary script creation—is concerning. These together raise suspicion about potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity including image loading, process access, and file creation suggest potential malicious behavior or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The paths all lead to various .dll files in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder.\n\nFirst off, Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing the operating system, like installing updates or configuring settings. It's not something malicious on its own. But seeing it execute multiple times and accessing these DLLs could be concerning.\n\nEach event shows that Dism.exe is detecting a file executable. The files in question are all named things like SysprepProvider.dll.mui, TransmogProvider.dll.mui, etc. These seem to be legitimate system files related to different providers. MUI stands for Multi-Use Interface, which usually indicates language packs or localization files.\n\nThe fact that multiple DLLs are being accessed by Dism.exe might not be suspicious on its own since Dism can interact with various system components during servicing operations. The repetitive nature of these events—each one accessing a different provider DLL—could suggest normal operation rather than malicious activity.\n\nI also notice that all the file paths point to a single temporary directory. This is typical when Windows is performing updates or installations, as it often extracts files into temp directories for processing. There's no indication here that these files are being executed outside of what Dism.exe is supposed to do.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the number of events is within normal variance. While multiple such events might raise an eyebrow, they don't necessarily indicate malicious intent unless there's something unusual about the files or their execution context. Since all these DLLs seem to be standard system components, it's less likely to be a red flag.\n\nI also think about whether Dism.exe has been used maliciously before. From what I know, it's not commonly exploited because it requires specific conditions and permissions to run commands, which are usually only accessible by the OS itself or authorized processes.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated detection of file executables by Dism.exe accessing standard system files in a temp directory doesn't provide enough evidence for malicious behavior. It seems more like normal servicing operations. However, I'm not entirely certain because sometimes attackers can abuse legitimate tools.

The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst event: process is cmd.exe with a command line that looks like it's calling Dism.exe with several parameters including disabling Windows Defender, removing it, and running quietly. The winlog indicates it's a Process Create event. This seems legitimate because I know that Dism can be used to manage features on a system.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe is accessed. The task is ProcessAccess, which typically means something opened or accessed the PowerShell process. But without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious. However, the following events show Dism.exe being used multiple times with various file operations.\n\nThird event: Dism.exe is created again, same as before. Winlog shows Process Create, so nothing unusual here yet.\n\nLooking at the subsequent events, I see a lot of File Executable Detected and File Created events from Dism.exe accessing files in a temporary directory. The paths are all under C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with various DLLs and .mui files. This seems like normal activity for Dism as it's processing or extracting components, especially since the command line was about removing Windows Defender.\n\nThe repeated file accesses might be part of a legitimate update or removal process. I don't see any indicators of malicious behavior here, like unusual file creation times, access to restricted areas, or unexpected network connections. All the files are in temporary directories, which is where you'd expect Dism.exe to work.\n\nAnother point: The initial command line uses \/Remove and \/NoRestart, which suggests someone is intentionally disabling Windows Defender, perhaps during an update or troubleshooting. It's not uncommon for admins to do this, so it doesn't raise a red flag.\n\nI'm considering if the repeated File Executable Detected events are normal. Since Dism.exe is known to access various DLLs and executables as part of its operations, these detections don't indicate malicious activity on their own. There's no sign of file modifications or deletions outside the temp directory, which would be more concerning.\n\nNo other processes like msbuild.exe or regsvr32.exe are involved, which are often used in attacks. The user account is 'fiddelis', which seems to be a standard username, not something elevated that might suggest an attack.\n\nIn conclusion, all these events fit within the expected behavior of using Dism.exe to modify system features, specifically removing Windows Defender. There's no evidence of unauthorized access or malicious code execution. Therefore, this batch isn't particularly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate use of Dism.exe to manage system features, specifically removing Windows Defender, with normal file operations in temporary directories.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

I know Dism.exe is related to Windows Deployment Services, used for installing and configuring Windows. It's legitimate, so that doesn't raise any flags on its own.\n\nNext, the winlog entries all mention a 'File Delete logged' task with the rule FileDeleteDetected. This indicates that a file was deleted and it triggered some monitoring rule, which is standard for security logging.\n\nLooking at the files being deleted, they're all under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with various .dll.mui extensions.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, all the events have \"process\" as 'Dism.exe'. Dism is short for DISM (Deployment Image Service Installer), which I know is a built-in Windows tool used for servicing operating system images. It's commonly used during installation or updates to configure Windows.\n\nLooking at the first event: it says that there was a file deletion logged, specifically for a file named 'DismCorePS.dll'. Then the next event is about changing the creation time of another file called 'DismHost.exe' also in the same Temp directory. That's a bit odd because why would you change the creation time? It might be trying to avoid detection by altering timestamps.\n\nThe subsequent events all follow the same pattern: they're all file delete logged events for various .dll and .mui files in the same temporary path. The paths are variations of different provider files, like 'DismProv.dll', 'en-US\\AppxProvider.dll.mui', etc. These seem to be related to language packs or system components.\n\nI'm thinking about what's normal here. Dism.exe typically handles image servicing tasks. When it runs, it might create temporary files and then delete them as part of its process. So the deletions themselves could be normal if they're part of a legitimate operation. However, the fact that there are multiple deletion events for different files in a short time span makes me wonder if this is part of an automated script or perhaps something malicious.\n\nAnother point to consider is the path where these files are located: 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...'. Temporary files here are common, but again, multiple deletions could indicate something suspicious. Also, changing the file creation time might be a tactic to bypass certain detection mechanisms or to make log analysis harder.\n\nI'm also thinking about possible attack vectors. Could this activity be part of a larger campaign? Maybe the files being deleted are malicious ones that were dropped earlier, and this is an attempt to clean up traces. Alternatively, it could be a legitimate process gone wrong, but given the repeated deletions and timestamp changes, I'm leaning towards it being potentially suspicious.\n\nSo putting it all together: Dism.exe is performing multiple file deletions in a temporary directory, which on its own might not be alarming, but combined with the change in file creation times and the specific files involved, there's enough here to raise an eyebrow. It doesn't definitively prove malicious activity, but these actions are out of the ordinary and could warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletion events from Dism.exe targeting various .dll and .mui files in a temporary directory, along with a file creation time change, suggest potential suspicious activity that may require deeper analysis.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I notice that all the events are related to powershell.exe processes. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nLooking deeper, many events show that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, like clrjit.dll and MpClient.dll. Legitimate scripts can load these, but sometimes attackers use such modules for obfuscation or persistence. Also, there are multiple file creations and registry modifications, which could be part of setting up a persistent backdoor.\n\nThe command lines in some events stand out. One uses \"-ExecutionPolicy Restricted\" with specific commands that just write to the host. While restricted execution policies prevent script execution, an attacker might use this to bypass detection. Another command queries INF files looking for certain patterns. That's unusual; attackers might be checking for system configurations or trying to identify something.\n\nThere are several events where the process accesses other processes and writes to the registry. These actions could be part of a larger campaign to modify system settings or establish persistence mechanisms. The repeated commands and tasks like \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" suggest ongoing activities that might be part of a script's initialization or cleanup phase.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it seems suspicious. The combination of multiple powershell.exe instances, unusual file operations, registry changes, and specific command-line patterns could indicate malicious behavior. While some events alone might not raise flags, the whole batch looks like a coordinated effort that merits closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes show file creation, registry modifications, and suspicious command-line activities indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, each event is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always 'Dism.exe', which I recognize as the Deployment Imaging Service and Management tool in Windows. This is typically used for deploying and managing Windows images, so it's a legitimate system process.\n\nThe winlog field consistently mentions a 'File Delete logged' task with the rule 'FileDeleteDetected'. So each event is logging a file deletion. That seems normal because Dism.exe would need to delete files as part of its operations when cleaning up or modifying image files.\n\nLooking at the file paths, all the events are deleting DLL files located in a specific temporary directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\[some GUID]\\*. The names of the files being deleted vary but they're all providers like FolderProvider.dll, GenericProvider.dll, and so on. These seem to be related to various system functionalities—like imaging, setup, or management.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about whether this activity is normal. Dism.exe does perform file deletions when it's working with image files, especially during cleanup operations after deploying updates or performing servicing actions. The fact that multiple provider DLLs are being deleted suggests that Dism.exe is cleaning up temporary files generated during a servicing operation.\n\nI also notice all events have the same process and similar file paths. This consistency makes me think it's part of a standard process rather than something malicious, where you might see varying processes or inconsistent file paths over time.\n\nConsidering the possibility of an attack: If Dism.exe was being exploited, I would expect more varied activities, like executing arbitrary code or accessing unexpected files. But in this case, it's just deleting known provider DLLs from a temp directory, which is within its normal operations.\n\nThe volume of events here—14 deletions—is significant but not necessarily suspicious on its own. It's possible that a large servicing operation was performed, leading to the deletion of multiple temporary files.\n\nAnother angle: Could this be part of a larger attack where these deletions are just one step? While it's possible, given the uniformity and nature of the events, there's no evidence in the logs provided to suggest any malicious intent. No unusual process names, file accesses outside the temp directory, or other red flags.\n\nAlso, looking at the timestamps if available (though not provided here), but assuming they're sequential and within a short period, it would support the idea that this is part of a single operation rather than multiple separate actions.\n\nIn summary, each event seems to be a legitimate action by Dism.exe as part of its normal operations. The repeated deletion of specific DLLs from a temp directory doesn't indicate any malicious behavior based on the provided data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Dism.exe deleting temporary files, which is normal during cleanup after servicing operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing some system activity. My job is to analyze all these together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I see that the command line starts with powershell.exe and mentions ExecutionPolicy Restricted. That's interesting because PowerShell scripts can be a vector for attacks, especially when executed with certain policies. The command seems to be checking INF files in the Windows directory for specific patterns. The task is 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. I'm not entirely sure what those tasks mean, but it could relate to system service events.\n\nThen there are multiple entries doing the same thing—querying INF files and looking for a particular string. This repetition makes me think that maybe this script is running multiple times, possibly across different services or components. It's either part of legitimate system maintenance or something malicious trying to stay under the radar by checking various locations.\n\nThe next set of events changes slightly. The command line now uses powershell.exe without ExecutionPolicy, and it's removing a specific file in the Temp directory: *entrada_principal.zip. This filename looks suspicious—maybe it's related to some malicious payload that drops files there. Removing such files could be part of an attack to clean up evidence or as part of a script intended to delete unwanted files.\n\nI also notice that both types of commands are being executed multiple times, with the same task categories. The repetition is notable because it suggests automation—like scheduled tasks or scripts running periodically. If this were legitimate, I might expect more variation in the command lines and perhaps different task events. Instead, seeing the exact same command lines repeatedly raises flags about possible automated malicious activities.\n\nAnother point is that both parts of the commands could be indicators of compromise (IoCs). The first part checking INF files for certain patterns could be related to detecting installed drivers or components, which in some cases might be malicious. Alternatively, it could be a legitimate script doing system checks. However, combined with the removal of specific Temp files, it seems more suspicious.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility of these events being related. Maybe an initial script is looking for certain INF patterns to determine if an environment is suitable for an attack, and then another part deletes evidence in the Temp directory. This sequence would make sense as a way to avoid detection by cleaning up after dropping malicious files.\n\nThe fact that both command types are repeated and have similar task events makes me lean towards this being malicious activity. The exact repetition without variation could indicate script-based attacks that are designed to be persistent or widespread across different services or components on the system.\n\nOverall, while there's a chance these could be legitimate system processes, the combination of checking INF files for specific patterns and removing files in the Temp directory, along with repetitive execution under restricted policies, suggests malicious intent. Therefore, I classify this batch as interesting because it has potential indicators of compromise that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated PowerShell commands checking system INF files and deleting specific Temp files, potentially indicating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this JSON data and trying to understand what's going on. There are multiple entries with keys like \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". Each entry seems to represent some activity on the system.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that there are several instances of \"powershell.exe\" being involved in different actions. For example, one entry shows that powershell.exe was accessed, another indicates it was created with a specific command line. The command line mentions removing an item from the Temp folder, which makes me think this script might be trying to delete some files there.\n\nThere's also mention of services.exe and svchost.exe interacting with the registry, which could indicate some system configuration changes or service modifications. Registry events often relate to how software is installed or configured on a system, so that's something to keep an eye on.\n\nI see that powershell.exe loads several DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET framework components. This makes sense because PowerShell often relies on these libraries for executing scripts.\n\nOne entry stands out where a file is created in the Temp directory with a name __PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1. Then, immediately after, it's deleted. This could be part of a script testing permissions or policies, but it might also be an indicator of malicious activity trying to remove evidence.\n\nThe repeated access and modifications involving powershell.exe are concerning. It's common for both legitimate scripts and malware to use PowerShell due to its powerful scripting capabilities. However, the combination of file creation\/deletion in Temp and registry modifications could suggest that something is attempting to maintain persistence or alter system behavior without proper authorization.\n\nI'm also noting the process names like services.exe and svchost.exe because they're often associated with legitimate Windows processes, but they can sometimes be used by malware to hide malicious activities. The specific tasks logged, such as \"Registry value set\", need to be evaluated in context—whether these are normal operations for those processes or not.\n\nThe fact that some entries have no file information while others do suggests varied activities: some actions involve files, others don't. This could mean a range of behaviors from script execution to service management.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of powershell.exe performing deletions and creating temporary files, along with registry modifications, raises red flags for potential malicious activity. However, without more context or knowing if these activities are part of legitimate operations, it's hard to be certain. It would be wise to investigate further, possibly checking logs around the same time period, verifying if these scripts are authorized, and scanning for any signs of malware.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided JSON data represents a series of system events logged on a Windows system.
