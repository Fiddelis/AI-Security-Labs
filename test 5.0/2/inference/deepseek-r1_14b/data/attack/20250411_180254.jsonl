{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's see what each part tells me.\n\nThe first event shows a process named \"chrome.exe\". That makes sense because Chrome is a common application and it's expected to appear in system logs when it's running or doing something. So nothing suspicious there at first glance.\n\nLooking at the second event, it mentions a Windows log related to a registry value being set. The task field says 'RegistryEvent', which I know is typically used by legitimate software to modify system settings. This could be Chrome adjusting some settings while running, which isn't unusual. However, sometimes malicious actors also use registry modifications for persistence or other purposes.\n\nSince there's no file information provided in the third part of this event, it's hard to tell if any files were accessed or modified during this process. Without that context, it's harder to determine if something suspicious happened. \n\nConsidering all these points together: a legitimate application (Chrome) making registry changes is pretty standard. There's no indication of unusual behavior or multiple events that might suggest an attack. So I think this batch isn't particularly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The event shows a legitimate process (chrome.exe) making a registry change, which is common and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm seeing a bunch of entries here. First, there are two events from winlogbeat.exe where files are being created. One creates a .winlogbeat.yml.new file and another seems to be the same file again.\n\nThen, there's an ApplicationFrameHost.exe accessing something in the registry. But that might just be normal Windows stuff.\n\nNext, I notice multiple entries from powershell.exe setting registry values. That could be concerning because PowerShell is often used for scripting and can be a vector for attacks. But I'm not sure if this is malicious or just legitimate script execution.\n\nLooking further down, there are a lot of Registry value sets by chrome.exe—like 14 times. Chrome might do some registry changes, but that many entries seem excessive. Also, chrome.exe loading modules like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll could be normal, but it's worth double-checking if these are legitimate or part of some exploit.\n\nThere's another file creation event by powershell.exe creating an 'objeto_padrao.txt' file in the Downloads folder. That filename looks unusual—it might be Portuguese for \"default_object.txt,\" which doesn't immediately ring any bells as malicious, but it could be a beacon or something suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry writes from different processes, especially powershell.exe and chrome.exe repeating similar actions, plus the creation of an odd-named file. These could indicate some form of script activity—maybe installing malware or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by different processes, including PowerShell and Chrome, along with file creations by winlogbeat.exe and an unusual file creation by PowerShell suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the events involve various processes like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, systeminfo.exe, and others. Notably, there are multiple entries from svchost.exe, which is a known process that can be legitimate but sometimes used by malware.\n\nLooking at the tasks: there are registry value sets, file creations, image loads, and process accesses. These activities aren't inherently suspicious on their own because many legitimate processes interact with the registry and load images.\n\nI see cmd.exe being used in command lines like \"systeminfo & reg query...\", which is a common technique for gathering system information and querying the registry. However, when combined with other actions, it might raise suspicion. But individually, these commands are often part of normal system administration tasks.\n\nPowershell.exe appears multiple times with process accesses and registry events. While PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, it's also widely used legitimately. The lack of unusual command lines or indicators like base64 encoding makes me think this could be normal admin activity.\n\nThere's a mention of WmiPrvSE.exe, which is associated with WMI services. It's legitimate but can be abused for persistence or lateral movement in attacks. However, without specific signs of abuse, it might just be standard operation.\n\nThe file paths mentioned are all within the Windows system directories and don't point to unusual locations like user-created files or network shares. This makes me less concerned about malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's no clear indication of malicious behavior. While some activities could potentially be suspicious in isolation, as a whole, they seem consistent with normal system operations and administrative tasks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of common system processes and events such as registry queries and file creations that do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
