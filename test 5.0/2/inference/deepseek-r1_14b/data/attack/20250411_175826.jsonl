{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let's break down each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial entries, there are multiple events from chrome.exe with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. Chrome doing some normal activity isn't unusual, especially if the user is browsing. I don't see any red flags here yet.\n\nNext, there are events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool for both admins and attackers, so I need to be cautious. The first event shows Process Create for powershell, which itself isn't suspicious, but I should check what's happening next.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the powershell.exe processes: it seems like it's executing some script that modifies file timestamps. That caught my attention because changing file times is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection. It might be trying to make files look older or newer than they are, which could hide malicious activities.\n\nThen, there are several Registry value sets by powershell.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms used by attackers to ensure their code runs on each system boot. This is a point where I should consider potential tampering or malicious behavior.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created and then immediately deleted. The path mentioned is temporary, which makes me think it's trying to execute something from memory or clean up evidence quickly. This quick file creation and deletion can be signs of suspicious activity, possibly indicating that the script didn't want to leave traces on disk.\n\nAdditionally, there are other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe making registry changes. While not all registry writes by these processes are bad, unusual activities here could indicate they're being exploited or misused as part of an attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated powershell.exe activity with file manipulation, registry edits, and the temporary script creation\/deletion points towards potential malicious behavior. This combination isn't typical for regular user actions and could be indicative of a cyberattack attempting to maintain persistence or hide its tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell activities, including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and script execution that may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at the process names and command lines:\n\n- There are multiple events where 'powershell.exe' is running with specific command-line arguments. Each command seems to be using a different path but follows a similar pattern. They're using Get-ChildItem to find files and then setting their LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\", which is a common tactic in malware to hide file creation times by resetting them to an early date.\n\n- The paths mentioned like 'modulo_logico', 'unidade_logico', etc., suggest they're targeting specific files. This kind of activity could be part of data exfiltration or sabotage, as modifying file timestamps might help avoid detection or alter logs.\n\nNext, the tasks in winlog:\n\n- Most events under 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' related to PowerShell starting up are normal but combined with the command-line arguments, they raise suspicion. The repeated use of these tasks could indicate a script running multiple times.\n\nLooking at other processes:\n\n- There's an event where 'svchost.exe' is setting registry values. Since svchost is commonly used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware, this requires attention, especially if combined with previous PowerShell activity.\n\n- 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' loading urlmon.dll might not be unusual on their own, but considering the overall context of other suspicious activities, it's worth noting.\n\n- The event where 'powershell.exe' loads MpClient.dll is a red flag. This DLL is part of Windows Defender, and if PowerShell is accessing it without legitimate cause, it could indicate an attempt to disable or manipulate antivirus features.\n\n- Another PowerShell event creates a file in the StartupProfileData directory. This is often used for persistence, meaning the malicious script might be trying to run on startup.\n\n- The 'conhost.exe' and 'winlogbeat.exe' events seem less concerning on their own but could be part of a larger scheme if they're associated with other activities.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe batch shows multiple PowerShell instances modifying file timestamps across various directories, which is suspicious. The repeated use of RegistryEvent tasks by svchost and powershell could indicate malicious configuration changes or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, the attempt to load MpClient.dll suggests an attack on antivirus software, a common step in malware to avoid detection.\n\nTherefore, this batch shows signs of potential malicious activity that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances modifying file timestamps and accessing system components may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a series of JSONL entries where each line represents an event with process information, windows log data, and file details.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first few events show processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe all performing registry value sets. Registry modifications can be normal but might also indicate malicious activity because attackers often modify the registry to hide their presence or change system configurations.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe setting registry values repeatedly. That's a bit concerning because while Chrome is a legitimate application, such frequent writes could be suspicious, especially if they're not part of its usual operation. Also, I noticed one event where powershell.exe accessed a process and another that created a file in the user's downloads folder. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so any deviation from normal usage should be flagged.\n\nLooking further down, several events show chrome.exe loading images like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are known as part of Windows Defender and AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface), which are legitimate system components. However, if these modules are being loaded by a malicious process, it could indicate an attempt to hide or bypass antivirus measures.\n\nThere's also an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a new configuration file in its directory. Winlogbeat is usually a monitoring tool, so unless there's something wrong with its setup, this might not be suspicious on its own. Similarly, the FileCreate task in powershell.exe points to a file being created in the user's downloads, which without context could be normal or part of malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the batch shows multiple instances of registry modifications across different processes, especially chrome.exe doing this repeatedly. This pattern might suggest a potential attack where an adversary is using legitimate tools like PowerShell and Chrome to carry out actions. The use of known system files by Chrome could be an attempt to blend in or exploit existing processes.\n\nWhile some events are benign, the combination raises flags. Multiple registry writes from different processes and especially from a browser process like Chrome can indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, the file creation activities might be part of data exfiltration or setting up files for further malicious actions.\n\nTaking into account all these factors, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because it exhibits behaviors that could be indicative of malicious activity when considered collectively.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications across different processes, including powershell.exe and chrome.exe, which may indicate potential malicious activity. Additionally, file creation events and image loading of known system files could be part of a broader attack pattern.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
