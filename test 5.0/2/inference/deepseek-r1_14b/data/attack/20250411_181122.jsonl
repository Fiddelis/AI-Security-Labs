{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries where the process is chrome.exe with tasks related to registry value sets and DNS queries. Chrome doing some registry changes isn't too unusual because it might be adjusting settings or extensions. The repeated 'RegistryEvent' seems normal for a browser that could be tweaking its configuration. Similarly, DNS queries are common as part of web browsing.\n\nThere's also an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. That makes sense since log agents often create config files during setup or updates.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate task by powershell.exe for an object_logico.txt file. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate scripting, but it can be abused too. However, without more context on what's inside that file or other suspicious actions around it, this alone might not raise flags. Plus, sometimes scripts just create files as part of their operation.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual processes or activities like network connections to known malicious domains, writes to unexpected locations, or attempts to execute binaries outside the norm. The majority of events are typical for a system with Chrome and Windows services running normally.\n\nSo overall, while there are some actions by powershell.exe that could warrant closer look if in a different context, the batch as a whole doesn't show clear signs of malicious behavior. It's within normal operational parameters.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist mostly of normal activities such as Chrome registry modifications, DNS queries, file creation by log agents, and PowerShell script execution, which do not indicate suspicious or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.1\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is a process creation for whoami.exe. That seems pretty standard; it's a common utility used to check user information. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple events related to powershell.exe. The second event shows that powershell.exe was accessed, and then another one where a registry value was set. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to look at the context.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where powershell.exe is run with a specific command line: it's using findstr to search for \"pass\" in various file types like .xml, .doc, etc. The command also uses select-string to look for \"password\". This seems concerning because searching for passwords in files could indicate data theft or malicious activity.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe loads different image files. These are normal as powershell needs these libraries to run. But the combination with the file creation and deletion is important.\n\nA temporary script file was created and then deleted shortly after. Creating a temp script might be part of executing a payload, especially if it's deleting it afterward to erase traces. This behavior raises suspicions because attackers often try to clean up their tracks.\n\nThere are also multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with the same command line. This repetition suggests that powershell is being executed repeatedly or in a loop, which could indicate automation—common in scripts used for malicious purposes.\n\nPutting this all together: whoami.exe is probably not an issue, but the extensive use of powershell with specific commands to search for passwords, coupled with creating and deleting temp files and repeated process invocations, points towards potential malicious activity. The actions don't seem legitimate; someone would typically not run such searches without a clear reason, especially in a script.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of events shows signs of possible unauthorized data access or exfiltration attempts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell process creations and activities that exhibit potentially malicious behavior, such as searching for sensitive information in files. Additionally, the creation and deletion of a temporary script file suggests an attempt to execute unauthorized code.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows a PowerShell process with a command line that includes searching for \"pass\" in various file types like .xml, .doc, etc. That seems suspicious because it looks like it's trying to find sensitive information. The task is related to Provider Lifecycle, which I'm not too familiar with, but the command line raises red flags.\n\nNext, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe created a file in a specific path. Winlogbeat is usually used for log shipping, so this could be normal unless it's accessing restricted areas or creating unexpected files.\n\nThen, Notepad.exe set a registry value. That's not unusual; many applications interact with the registry. But I should keep an eye on what exactly was changed.\n\nAnother PowerShell process accessed something with ProcessAccess. Again, the combination of multiple PowerShell events might indicate something malicious, especially if they're accessing different parts of the system.\n\nThere are several events where calc.exe and Calculator.exe load urlmon.dll, which is a standard Windows DLL for URL handling. But since it's being loaded by these processes, I wonder if there's anything else going on here. Maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking further, another PowerShell instance loaded MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That seems odd because why would PowerShell need to load that? Could be a red flag for something more malicious.\n\nThere are multiple entries where svchost.exe and other system processes set registry values. Svchost is a legitimate process, but repeated changes could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms being set up.\n\nI notice several events involving Registry value sets across different processes like conhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe. This could be part of setting up persistence for malware, as attackers often modify the registry to ensure their tools run at startup.\n\nThere's also an event where a PowerShell process created a file in the StartupProfileData directory. That's concerning because it suggests that something is writing to a location typically associated with user profiles, possibly trying to execute at startup.\n\nMultiple instances of findstr.exe being used to search for \"pass\" in various files add more suspicion. This looks like an attempt to gather credentials or sensitive data from different file types.\n\nPutting it all together: several PowerShell processes with potentially malicious commands, multiple registry modifications across different legitimate-looking processes, and attempts to access or create files in specific locations. These patterns are often indicative of a cyberattack or malicious activity trying to remain undetected. The repeated use of tools like findstr.exe and the modification of system components suggest possible persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if each event on its own is malicious, but the combination does raise concerns. The volume of activities from PowerShell and the registry modifications are particularly worrying. Therefore, this batch likely deserves further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events including PowerShell command lines searching for sensitive data, repeated registry modifications, and file creations in unusual locations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm seeing a lot of process creations and some registry activity.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` are being used with command lines that look suspicious. For example, using cmd.exe to delete Notepad.exe processes and remove user accounts via net.exe. This kind of behavior could be part of a script trying to clean up traces or disable accounts.\n\nAlso, the use of `WMIC.exe` stands out because it's often associated with remote command execution, which is a red flag for malicious activity. The commands being run in WMIC might be attempting to delete processes or load specific DLLs, which could indicate an attempt to hide activities or disrupt system functions.\n\nI notice several Registry value set events across different processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe. This suggests that the attackers might be trying to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms to ensure their presence continues after a reboot.\n\nLooking at the files loaded by these processes, they're accessing DLLs related to Defender's MpOAV.dll, which could mean attempts to bypass antivirus measures or alter how defender operates.\n\nConsidering all these points together—process deletions, user account removals, registry modifications—it seems like someone is trying to clean up their tracks and potentially establish persistence. These activities are indicative of malicious behavior, so the batch as a whole definitely merits investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious processes (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, WMIC.exe) executing commands that delete processes and user accounts, accessing registry values which could indicate persistence or privilege escalation attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That's probably just the log shipping tool doing its job, nothing suspicious there. The second is powershell.exe creating a file too; I'm not sure yet if that's normal or not.\n\nThen there's an event with no process, winlog task, and file—this seems like maybe an error or something unrelated.\n\nNext up, another winlogbeat.exe creating the same file as before, which makes sense since it might be retrying on failure. Still nothing bad here.\n\nNow, powershell.exe accessing a process. Powershell can do a lot, both good and bad. Accessing a process could be normal admin work or something malicious. I'll keep an eye out for more events involving powershell.\n\nLooking further, there's whoami.exe being run from the command line. Whoami is typically used to check user permissions, so that might be part of some script checking the current user context. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nAnother powershell process access—maybe it's part of a script running multiple commands. Still need more context.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe command deleting tasks using schtasks. Schtasks is a legitimate tool for managing scheduled tasks, but deleting them could be part of removing persistence mechanisms by malicious actors. This is something to note because unusual deletions can indicate tampering.\n\nFollowing that, powershell.exe accessing another process—this repetition might suggest it's part of a loop or script execution.\n\nAnother cmd.exe modifying the registry with schtasks. Registry modifications are common but could be indicators of malware installing or removing itself from the system. Worth monitoring how these changes fit together.\n\nSVCHOST.exe is involved in registry events next. SVCHOST can run various services, so it's hard to say without more info, but some malware uses svchost as a wrapper for malicious processes. The event could be legitimate or part of an attack.\n\nSchtasks.exe again creating processes and loading taskschd.dll—normal behavior if setting up new tasks, but repeated deletions earlier might suggest something is being cleaned up after execution.\n\nAnother SVCHOST registry event—the same pattern continues with possible modifications that could be malicious.\n\nCmd.exe making more registry changes. This seems like a lot of cmd and schtasks activity, which could indicate someone trying to remove traces or set up long-term persistence.\n\nConhost.exe modifying the registry too—conhost is often used for console applications, but again, if it's doing registry writes, that could be part of malicious activities like installing backdoors.\n\nMore powershell and whoami events. The repetition of these commands might point towards a script that's running multiple times or in a loop.\n\nPutting this all together: the batch shows multiple instances of process creations (especially powershell.exe), repeated deletions of scheduled tasks using schtasks, registry modifications involving cmd.exe and conhost.exe, and file creation by winlogbeat. \n\nThe combination raises flags because:\n\n1. Powershell is often used for malicious activities due to its powerful scripting capabilities.\n2. Multiple schtasks deletions might indicate an attempt to remove traces or disable security-related tasks.\n3. Registry changes across different processes could be part of installing malware components or backdoors.\n4. The use of cmd.exe and conhost.exe for registry writes isn't typical and could be indicators of malicious activity trying to remain undetected.\n\nHowever, it's possible some of these activities are legitimate, such as system administration tasks or script executions. But given the frequency and combination of actions—especially involving deletion of scheduled tasks and multiple registry modifications—it leans towards potential malicious behavior.\n\nI'm not 100% certain because I can't see the full context of each process, but based on the patterns, it's more likely than not that this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe accessing processes and cmd.exe deleting scheduled tasks suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. There are several entries from powershell.exe loading images and accessing various files. I notice that a script file was created and then deleted shortly after.

Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where powershell.exe is being used. PowerShell can be a red flag because it's often associated with administrative tasks and can execute commands that are hard to trace. But sometimes it's just legitimate use. However, in this batch, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry. That could indicate suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the command lines, I see commands like net user \/del \/domain and sc delete win32times. These commands are for deleting users and services respectively. Deleting domain users without legitimate cause might be part of an attack to remove traces or disable accounts. The use of \"Admin\" in some of the user names suggests they might be targeting administrative privileges.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of cmd.exe with similar commands, such as whoami.exe and sc delete. These tools are often used in command-line attacks to execute tasks quietly. Using them in conjunction with each other could be part of a larger script trying to cover its tracks or perform multiple malicious actions.\n\nThe events involving services.exe modifying the registry and deleting services also catch my eye. Services are crucial for system operations, so removing them without proper authorization might indicate an attempt to disrupt normal processes or hide malware.\n\nI should consider if these activities could be part of routine maintenance. However, the volume and combination of commands seem excessive. Multiple deletions across different users and services, coupled with registry modifications, make me lean towards this being malicious activity rather than normal admin tasks.\n\nLooking for patterns, I see a recurring theme of process creation and registry changes, which are common in persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure they remain active after reboots. This suggests a possible attack where an adversary is trying to remove evidence or disable certain services.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows several red flags: repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe for deletion commands, multiple registry modifications, and service deletions. These activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior aimed at system compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events indicate potentially malicious activity including user deletions, service removals, and registry modifications using various tools like powershell.exe and cmd.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed. That's a common utility used to find out user information, so in itself, that might be normal unless it's part of something malicious.\n\nThen I notice multiple entries for powershell.exe. PowerShell is powerful but can also be used for malicious activities. However, without seeing specific commands, it's hard to say if this is suspicious. The events show 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set', which could indicate script execution or configuration changes, common in both legitimate scripts and attacks.\n\nThere are some cmd.exe processes deleting files in the Temp directory. This could be part of a cleanup routine by malware to remove traces of itself. Alternatively, it might just be a legitimate process cleaning up old files. The exact command lines aren't clear enough to determine intent, but it's something that could raise an eyebrow.\n\nI also see 'conhost.exe' accessing the registry. Conhost is often used in Windows for console applications, so this isn't immediately suspicious unless combined with other actions.\n\nLooking further down, there are several events where powershell.exe is being launched with '& {}'. This looks like a possible attempt to execute something else through PowerShell without logging the command directly, which can be a tactic used in obfuscation techniques. However, without more context on what's being executed, it's hard to confirm.\n\nThe logs also show multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events for PowerShell, which are normal during script execution but could indicate that scripts are running, possibly malicious ones.\n\nThere are several 'Registry value set' tasks across different processes. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate software installation or configuration, but they're also a common tactic for malware to establish persistence or modify system settings.\n\nThe image load events in PowerShell show it loading various DLLs which is standard behavior for running scripts that involve .NET Framework components, so this alone isn't concerning unless combined with other indicators.\n\nPutting all this together, the batch shows multiple signs of potentially suspicious activities: repeated powershell executions, registry modifications, file deletions, and obscure command lines. These could be indicative of malicious behavior such as script execution, persistence mechanisms, or data exfiltration. However, without clear evidence of malicious code being executed or direct indicators like known malware signatures, it's challenging to definitively classify this batch.\n\nThe combination suggests a possible attack, but there isn't enough concrete information to be certain.

That's a common tool used to get user information, but it's legitimate. It doesn't look malicious on its own unless it's part of something else. Then there are several instances of 'powershell.exe' being accessed. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful, but accessing it isn't suspicious in itself—many scripts and admins use it.\n\nLooking further, I see 'RuntimeBroker.exe', which is a Windows process for managing runtime events. It's normal to see it interacting with the registry. Notepad.exe accessing the registry also seems okay; maybe it's just reading some settings.\n\nThere are multiple entries where processes like Calculator.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe set registry values. These are standard system processes, so this activity is expected and not concerning.\n\nI spot a few DNS queries from chrome.exe. Browsers usually do that to resolve domain names, so nothing odd there. The network connections from Chrome are also normal for any browser accessing the internet.\n\nThere's an entry where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its own directory. That seems fine too; it's likely writing logs or configuration files.\n\nPutting all this together, I don't see any red flags. All the processes and activities listed are typical for a system with users browsing, running tools like calculator, using PowerShell scripts, and Chrome accessing the internet. There's no evidence of unusual access patterns, failed logins, file creations in unexpected places, or other signs that would indicate malicious activity.\n\nSo, I think this batch is not particularly interesting for further investigation because there's nothing out of the ordinary.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as process creations and registry accesses by legitimate processes like whoami.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and others.
