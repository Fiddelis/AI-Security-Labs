{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs. I'm seeing multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also a tool attackers love because it can execute code and access system features.\n\nLooking through each event:\n1. There are several instances where powershell.exe is accessing processes or registry values. That alone isn't suspicious, but the frequency might be worth noting.\n2. I notice a command line in some events that uses Add-Type to add the System.Windows.Forms assembly. This suggests they're trying to capture screenshots. Why take screenshots? It could be for legitimate purposes like documentation, but it can also indicate malicious activity like screen scraping or persistence.\n3. The specific commands are saving images to the TEMP directory with names like \"unidade_logico.png\" and \"tarefa_comum.png\". This is a bit unusual since most scripts would have more generic naming or use different directories.\n4. Additionally, there's a process involving mscoree.dll and other .NET framework components being loaded by powershell.exe. While this isn't inherently bad, it could be part of a larger script execution that's worth monitoring.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell instances with screenshot-taking commands might indicate an attacker trying to capture visual information from the system. This behavior is not common in normal user activity and could be part of an ongoing malicious process. There are enough red flags here to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes, registry values, and loading .NET framework components, along with screenshot-taking commands that could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's dive into this analysis. I'm looking at a batch of system logs from various events, all related to PowerShell activities on a Windows system. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple entries are powershell.exe processes with command lines that seem to be capturing screenshots and saving them to the TEMP directory. The command lines add the System.Windows.Forms assembly, create bitmaps from the screen, copy from the screen, and save images. These actions on their own could be legitimate, like part of a screenshot utility or debugging tool.\n\nHowever, several flags pop up. First, each process writes to different files in %TEMP%, with names like \"elemento_ativo.png\" and \"modulo_principal.png\". The naming seems arbitrary but consistent across events. Then, I see that the same script is being executed multiple times, which might indicate a loop or repeated activity, possibly trying to capture multiple screenshots.\n\nNext, there's an event where a file \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1\" is created and then deleted shortly after. This behavior is suspicious because creating and deleting files without keeping them can be a tactic used by malware or scripts to avoid detection. Additionally, the process uses \"powershell.exe & { ... }\", which could indicate inline execution of code that might not be easily visible in standard logs.\n\nAnother point is the event with task 'Execute a Remote Command' and 'Executing Pipeline'. These suggest that commands are being executed remotely, possibly over a network or through another mechanism. Combined with the other events, this could imply that an attacker is trying to execute malicious scripts or commands on the system.\n\nMoreover, the use of powershell.exe in multiple ways—both as a process name and in command lines—adds weight to the suspicion. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate scripting but also by attackers for lateral movement and payload execution.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not be alarming, the combination of repeated screenshot captures, file creation\/deletion, remote command execution, and multiple powershell processes suggests potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch should be classified as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes capturing screenshots, temporary file operations, and remote command executions suggest potential malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this batch of events to figure out if they're interesting or not. I'm seeing a bunch of system log entries here, each in JSONL format. My goal is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine whether it's relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst off, I notice that there are multiple entries from different processes. Let me go through them one by one to spot any patterns or potential red flags.\n\nThe first event is a PowerShell process with a command line argument. The command seems to be capturing the screen and saving it as an image in the TEMP directory. That's a bit concerning because screen capturing can be used for malicious purposes like screenshoting sensitive information without user consent. I'm wondering if this is part of some reconnaissance or data exfiltration activity.\n\nNext, there are several entries from powershell.exe related to file creation and registry events. Creating files in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory might indicate an attempt to persist across reboots, which is a common tactic for malware. Registry modifications can also be a sign of malicious activities since attackers often alter system configurations to maintain persistence.\n\nLooking further, there's a conhost.exe process making registry changes. Conhost is typically used by legitimate processes, but unauthorized registry edits could be suspicious. This might suggest that something is trying to hide its tracks or modify system behavior in an unintended way.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file isn't inherently malicious, but it's worth noting because sometimes attackers use tools like this for logging purposes. If winlogbeat is being used legitimately, it's usually part of monitoring solutions, but without more context, I'm cautious.\n\nThe ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe making registry changes are interesting. These processes are typically benign, so seeing them modify the registry might indicate that they're being exploited or used as part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThere's also a significant number of events from chrome.exe. It's performing multiple registry writes and DNS queries, which is normal for a browser, but the sheer volume makes me think something unusual is happening. Additionally, Chrome loading system32 files like amsi.dll (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) might be part of its normal operation to check for malicious code, but it could also be an attacker trying to blend in by triggering these scans.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of PowerShell activities, file creations in non-standard directories, registry modifications across multiple processes, and unusual Chrome behavior raises some red flags. The screen capture script is particularly concerning because it's a known technique for exfiltration. While each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the pattern suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether these actions could also be legitimate. For example, scripts running in PowerShell can be used for system administration tasks, and tools like winlogbeat are often part of monitoring setups. But given the volume of events and the specific actions taken, especially the screen capture and file creation in non-standard locations, it leans more towards malicious intent.\n\nI'm also considering confidence levels. The justification is based on multiple indicators pointing towards possible malicious activity, but without definitive proof (like known malware signatures or exploit attempts), the confidence isn't extremely high. However, the combination of several concerning actions does increase the likelihood that this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events indicate suspicious activity including PowerShell screen capture and file creation in non-standard directories, along with multiple registry modifications across processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
