Each event is a JSON object with details about a file creation task by the process SDXHelper.exe. All these entries are very similar, only differing in the file paths.\n\nFirst, I'll check if there's any indication of malicious activity here. SDXHelper.exe sounds like it could be related to Microsoft Office or some legitimate software since it's under the Microsoft directory. The files being created are JavaScript files located in an \"OfflineFiles\" directory, which suggests they might be cached data for Excel Copilot features.\n\nLooking at the file paths, each has a unique name but follows a predictable naming pattern: excel-copilot-strings-n-tier followed by different hashes or identifiers. This consistency makes me think these are legitimate updates or cache files being created by Office software.\n\nThere's no evidence of unusual process behavior beyond creating these files. No unexpected processes or irregularities in timestamps, which might hint at malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or credential dumping. Since all events originate from the same source and follow a consistent pattern, it doesn't raise red flags for an attack.\n\nI should also consider if repeated file creation could be a sign of something suspicious, but in this case, it's part of normal operations for Office applications managing their resources. The files are being created under the user's AppData directory, which is standard for application behavior.\n\nAnother point to note is that all these events were generated by the same process over a short period, indicating a bulk file creation activity, possibly during an update or initialization of Copilot features in Excel. There's no sign of failed attempts or errors associated with these operations, which would have been cause for concern.\n\nIn summary, while each individual event is not alarming, the combination shows repetitive legitimate actions by a known Microsoft-related process.

Each event is a JSON object indicating that the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process created a file in a specific location. The files all have similar paths but different filenames.\n\nFirst off, SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar—it's part of Microsoft Office, specifically related to handling offline files and solution packages. So this isn't an unusual process running on a system.\n\nThe events all show the same task: \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate.\" This means it's just logging file creation activities. Since these are occurring in the OfflineFiles directory within the Microsoft Office package, they're likely part of normal operation when accessing or updating files while offline.\n\nI notice that each event has a unique filename suffix, like _a447e403fce5... and so on. These seem to be tracking different versions or components being saved. This kind of activity is typical for applications managing cached or offline data, especially in collaborative tools like Excel's Copilot features.\n\nThere's nothing here that stands out as malicious. No signs of unauthorized access, failed logins, or writes to restricted areas. All the files are in a user-specific AppData directory, which isn't a system-critical location. The repetition of similar events might indicate a bulk operation or multiple requests from the same process, but again, this is within normal bounds for an office application.\n\nI also consider whether there's any red flag in the frequency of these events.

Each entry has three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file information. \n\nThe process name is consistently \"SDXHelper.exe,\" which suggests it's a known system or application process. Next, the task under winlog is labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate),\" indicating that a file was created. The file paths are all within the same directory structure under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office...\" and the files have names like \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\" followed by various hashes.\n\nI notice that multiple entries create different files with varying hash suffixes. For instance, there's \"bc27bc578cb830e5653d09d0c94a6030.js,\" and others ending similarly. The repetition of the same process name and the task suggests that this is part of a legitimate operation.\n\nConsidering typical system behavior, creating multiple files in such a directory is common for applications like Microsoft Office when downloading or updating resources. \"excel-copilot-strings\" likely refers to language packs or string resources used by Excel Copilot, which is a known feature of Microsoft Office.\n\nSince all the events are generated by the same process and follow a predictable pattern without any signs of anomalies—like unusual file names, locations outside standard directories, or unexpected volumes—it doesn't seem suspicious. There's no indication of file creation times being too close together or an unusually high number beyond what would be typical for an update.\n\nI'm also checking if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known process. A quick mental note tells me it's associated with the Microsoft Office suite, used for deploying and managing updates. Therefore, its activity in creating files within its designated directory isn't unusual.\n\nThe justification for classification as \"NOT INTERESTING\" hinges on the fact that all activities are expected from legitimate software operations. There's no evidence of malicious behavior such as unauthorized access, writes to restricted areas, or attempts to execute code outside normal operations.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm fairly certain because the process and file paths align with known Microsoft Office behaviors, and there's nothing in the log entries that deviate from standard operating procedures for updates or resource installations. However, if these files were created in unexpected locations or showed signs of tampering, confidence might shift towards \"INTERESTING.\"\n\nSo, after analyzing the entire batch, I conclude that this activity doesn't warrant further investigation as it's part of normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in a known Microsoft Office directory for resource files, indicating legitimate update or installation activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The files are JavaScript (.js) resources related to \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\", with various filenames.\n\nFirst, I notice that all events have the same process name and task. They're all file creation events by the same process. The file paths vary slightly but follow a predictable pattern with different hashes in their filenames.\n\nSince these are file creation logs, they could be part of normal operations, especially if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a legitimate application that generates or loads such files. However, I'm cautious because multiple identical events might indicate something suspicious, like the same file being created multiple times, possibly after modification or due to an error.\n\nBut in this case, each event creates a unique file path with different hashes. This could be part of standard operations, especially if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is associated with Office add-ins or updates that require multiple files. The presence of these specific JavaScript files might not be inherently malicious but could relate to legitimate software functionality.\n\nI also consider whether the paths are typical for such processes. They're located under the user's AppData directory, which is standard for application settings and resources. However, the specific subdirectory \"SolutionPackages\" with a long GUID suggests it's part of an Office add-in or package, which is common but sometimes used by malicious actors to hide files.\n\nThe fact that each event creates a new file, not overwriting existing ones, might indicate normal behavior for resource loading. But the repetition of similar events could raise flags if seen in bulk, especially if the same process is generating many such files quickly.\n\nI'm unsure about \"SDXHelper.exe\"'s reputation. If it's known to be malicious or part of a less common tool, that would increase suspicion. However, without specific indicators of compromise (IoCs), these events alone don't provide enough evidence for malicious activity.\n\nIn summary, while the repeated file creation by the same process could be concerning, there's not enough context or deviation from normal behavior to classify this batch as suspicious.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries where each line represents an event. The first thing I notice is that all these events are coming from the same process: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's a clue because sometimes specific processes can be indicators of certain activities.\n\nLooking at each event, they're all labeled under \"winlog\" with the task being \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So each event indicates that a file was created. The path for each file is in the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. The filenames vary, but they all follow a pattern like \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_*.js\".\n\nNow, I need to consider whether this is normal behavior or something suspicious. SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar; it's often associated with Microsoft Office add-ins or solutions. Creating files in the OfflineFiles directory makes sense for an Office-related process because they might be caching resources or storing data locally for offline use.\n\nEach file is a .js file, which is JavaScript, commonly used in web applications and add-ins. Having multiple files created by the same process isn't unusual if it's part of a legitimate update or cache refresh. The fact that each event shows the creation of these files sequentially suggests that this is part of a routine process.\n\nI also notice that there are duplicates in the filenames, like \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_dd5cf83abd6a170ac722a935abcf684d.js\" appearing twice. This duplication might be an indicator of something repetitive or a script creating these files multiple times, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nConsidering the number of events—there are 14 entries in total—it's possible that this is part of a larger update process where several files are being generated. Since all events come from the same source and target the same directory, there's no evidence of varied or unusual activities across different parts of the system.\n\nAnother angle to look at is whether the path is writable by the application. The AppData\\Local folder is a common place for applications to store temporary and user-specific data, so creating files here isn't a red flag on its own.\n\nI should also think about what malicious behavior would look like in logs. Typically, suspicious activities involve unauthorized access, creation of hidden files, execution from unexpected locations, or attempts to modify system configurations. Here, the process is well-known (assuming SDXHelper.exe is legitimate), and the actions are straightforward file creations in a standard directory.\n\nHowever, without knowing if this specific version of the files is known to be malicious, I can't rule out the possibility entirely. But given the information at hand, there's no clear indication of malicious intent. The events fit a pattern that could easily be part of a legitimate update or cache refresh by Microsoft Office components.\n\nIn conclusion, while every situation needs careful consideration, especially in cybersecurity, this batch doesn't exhibit signs that would raise immediate red flags. It seems more like routine operations rather than malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe within a standard directory for Office resources, likely part of legitimate caching or update processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

This makes me think it's a legitimate application because it's consistent across all logs. Next, the winlog task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which suggests these are file creation events. That in itself isn't suspicious unless there's unusual activity.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\" directories. The specific files being created have names like \"excel-copilot-strings_*.js\" and \"vendors~code-preview-dialog_*.js\". These seem like JavaScript files related to Office add-ins or extensions, possibly for features like Copilot in Excel.\n\nI'm considering whether this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is likely a part of Microsoft Office's setup or update process. Creating multiple JS files under the OfflineFiles directory suggests it's either caching resources or updating them. The repetition of file paths with different hashes (the long GUIDs) indicates that these are unique instances each time, possibly for versioning or incremental updates.\n\nNow, looking at the timestamps isn't possible here, but if all events happened within a short period, it could indicate an update or cache refresh.

The files being created are all JavaScript files with various names like vendors~copilotchatdisplay.js and excel-copilot-strings followed by different hashes. These look like they might be related to some Office add-ins or plugins since they're in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory.\n\nWait, there are multiple entries creating the same files again and again. That could mean a few things. Maybe it's normal for this application to create these files periodically, especially if it's part of an update process or cache refresh. But seeing so many identical file creation events might be unusual. I wonder if this is part of a legitimate update or if something's off.\n\nAlso, the paths are quite deep and specific, which makes me think they're not standard system files but rather components of user-installed software, perhaps Office add-ins like Copilot. But why so many similar entries? Is SDXHelper.exe supposed to create all these files?\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. A quick search tells me it's related to Microsoft Office, specifically handling updates or package resources. So, the file creation might be normal during operation.\n\nHowever, the high frequency and repetition of creating the same files could indicate something suspicious, like an attempt to write multiple copies of certain files which might be malicious in nature. Alternatively, it could be a bug causing repeated writes.\n\nAnother angle: The files being created are JavaScript resources. Malware sometimes drops scripts or uses them for lateral movement. But again, since this is within the Office package structure and from a known process, that's less likely.\n\nI'm also noticing that some file paths repeat with different hashes, which could be normal if they're versioned files. But the exact same filenames appearing multiple times might not be usual unless there's an issue with how resources are being cached or updated.\n\nSo putting it all together: The process is legitimate, but the high number of identical events and repeated file creation could raise flags. Maybe this indicates a configuration error, a bug, or perhaps something more nefarious like data exfiltration through multiple writes.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because while individually these might be normal, collectively they show unusual activity that needs closer inspection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by the same process may indicate suspicious behavior or potential tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

The justification is that the activities are normal for the application and don't exhibit any characteristics of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe within standard Microsoft Office directories, likely related to legitimate Office operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of events. First off, I notice that most of the entries are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in a specific directory related to Microsoft Office's OfflineFiles. The file paths all follow a pattern with varying string identifiers, which suggests they might be different versions or components being downloaded or cached.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, there are multiple instances where the same file is created twice. For example, \"excel-copilot-strings_78e259be1b68f3f3ddb9114118cde491.js\" appears twice. This duplication could be normal if the system is retrying a download or if it's part of an update process.\n\nThen there's one event from \"MdSched.exe\" modifying a registry value. MdSched is typically related to Windows Defender, so this might just be regular maintenance or scanning activities. Since it's only one out of many events and doesn't show any signs of malicious behavior like multiple failed attempts or unusual times, I don't see a red flag here.\n\nConsidering the overall picture, these events seem consistent with standard Office operations, possibly during an update or cache refresh. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, strange processes, or repetitive failed attempts that would indicate malicious activity. The repeated file creations are likely part of normal operations rather than something suspicious.\n\nI also think about whether these files could be malicious. However, given that they're under Microsoft's Office directory and the naming suggests they're related to Excel Copilot features, it's more probable they're legitimate components. Unless there's a known exploit tied to these specific file hashes or versions, which isn't indicated here, I wouldn't classify them as suspicious.\n\nAnother angle is checking if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known malicious process. A quick lookup tells me it's associated with Microsoft's OfficeSuite for managing updates and settings, so it's not an unknown entity. The fact that all these events are from the same user and path reinforces that this is internal Office behavior.\n\nLastly, there's no indication of any system anomalies or deviations from baseline activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The first thing that catches my eye is that all the events are from the same process: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's interesting because it suggests some kind of repetitive or automated activity.\n\nThe task in each event is labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means something is creating files on the system. The file paths all point to a specific location under the user's AppData directory, specifically within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages and OfflineFiles. Each entry has a unique filename ending with \".js\", which makes me think these are JavaScript files.\n\nI'm noticing that each file path starts with \"excel-copilot-strings_\" followed by different hexadecimal strings. The repetition of these files being created, especially the fact that some are duplicated (like the 931d6711f96475ff... appears twice), makes me wonder if this is part of a legitimate process or something malicious.\n\nSDXHelper.exe sounds familiar; I think it's associated with Microsoft Office. Maybe it's part of some feature, like Copilot in Excel, that needs to download resources. If so, these file creations would be normal as part of the application's operation. However, creating multiple JavaScript files could also be a sign of something suspicious, especially if they're being written by an executable that isn't typically associated with script execution.\n\nAnother angle is considering whether this activity is part of a data exfiltration or malicious script injection. The fact that many files are created in quick succession might indicate a possible attempt to write multiple payloads or modules. But without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nI'm also thinking about the structure of these file paths. They all follow a predictable naming convention, which is common for legitimate software updates or cache files. However, in cybersecurity, sometimes attackers use such patterns to blend in with normal traffic.\n\nSince I don't have information about whether \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known for creating multiple JavaScript files, I'm leaning towards this being part of a legitimate process because the files are within an Office directory and named after Copilot strings. But the number of files created might still be worth investigating to ensure there's no abuse or unauthorized activity.\n\nIn summary, while these events look somewhat routine, the volume and specific naming could warrant further inspection to rule out any malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe within the same path suggest potential malicious or unusual activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see if there's anything that stands out.\n\nFirst, all the events are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. Looking at each one, they all have similar structures: process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\", the task is \"File created\" under winlog, and the file path points to various JavaScript files inside an Office SolutionPackage.\n\nI know that \"SDXHelper.exe\" sounds familiar; I think it's related to Microsoft Office. Maybe part of the Copilot feature or something similar. The file paths are all within the \"Microsoft\\Office\\\" directory, which is a standard location for Office-related data and add-ins. The filenames like \"excel-copilot-strings_...\" suggest they're string resource files used by Excel.\n\nEach event is just indicating that a file was created. So individually, these events don't seem suspicious because creating files is a normal part of how applications work, especially when updating or initializing resources. But I should consider the combination—there are multiple entries, each creating a different JavaScript file. It looks like several files were created by the same process in quick succession.\n\nI wonder if this is part of a legitimate update process. Office often updates its components, and these JS files might be part of that. However, since all events show the same process name and similar file paths, it doesn't raise immediate red flags about malicious activity. If it were an attack, I'd expect varied processes or different file types being accessed.\n\nAnother thing to check is whether \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known for any malicious behavior. A quick mental note tells me that this process isn't commonly listed as malware. It's more likely a legitimate component, perhaps handling Office add-ins or language resources.\n\nThe multiple entries could also be due to a script or background process that's setting up the environment when an Office application starts. Sometimes, applications create several temporary or cache files upon launch, which is normal behavior.\n\nI don't see any indicators of compromise here, like file hashes matching known malware, access to restricted directories, or unusual process behaviors. All events are straightforward file creations in expected locations by a known Microsoft-related process.\n\nSo putting it all together: same process creating multiple JS files in a standard Office directory. No signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity. It looks like legitimate operations related to Office features.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe, which is likely part of Microsoft Office's normal operation, particularly related to Copilot language resources.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. So, each event is a JSON object indicating that \"SDXHelper.exe\" created a file in the path specified. The same process name and similar file paths are repeated multiple times.\n\nHmm, first thought: it seems like the same process is creating multiple files, which could be normal if it's part of the application's standard operation. The file names all start with \"excel-copilot-strings\" followed by different hashes, so they might be different versions or segments of some resource files.\n\nI remember that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is often related to Microsoft Office, specifically for handling things like Copilot features. So these could just be legitimate updates or cache files being created as part of the normal operation of Office applications. The repeated creation of similar files doesn't immediately raise red flags unless there's something unusual about the file names or paths.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're all within the \"Microsoft\\Office\" directory under the user's AppData. That's a standard location for application data and settings. No signs of being in a system or sensitive folder that could indicate malicious activity.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many events? If this is part of an update process or caching mechanism, it might be normal to create several files at startup or during updates. Since each event is just a file creation by the same process, without any other indicators like access to restricted areas or execution of scripts, I don't see evidence of malicious behavior.\n\nAlso, the fact that all events are identical except for the file names suggests it's part of a loop or batch processing within the application. Maybe the app is downloading multiple resources and storing them as separate files for efficiency.\n\nSo putting it all together: same process creating legitimate-looking files in expected locations. No anomalies detected when looking at the entire batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Microsoft Office and appears to be part of normal operation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that many of them are generated by \"SDXHelper.exe\". Each event shows that a file was created in a specific path related to Microsoft Office's OfflineFiles directory. The filenames vary but follow a pattern with long hashes or identifiers. This suggests it's part of normal operations since these files might be cached resources for Office features like Excel Copilot.\n\nThen, there are two events where \"cleanmgr.exe\" is involved. One event shows the creation of this process. Cleanmgr is known to be part of Windows for disk cleanup, so that's a benign activity. The other event related to SDXHelper.exe creating files doesn't change my initial assessment.\n\nI should consider if these actions are typical or unusual. Office applications often create temporary or cached files when running, especially with features like Copilot which might require additional resources. The repeated file creation by SDXHelper could be part of its normal operation, perhaps during an update or while accessing cloud content offline.\n\nThere's also consistency in the paths and filenames. They all follow a predictable structure under the same directory, which aligns with how legitimate software handles resource files. No signs of random or varied naming that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nI don't see any indicators of compromise here. Processes like creating temporary files by trusted executables are common and not inherently suspicious unless they're accessing unexpected locations or behaving abnormally. Since all events point to standard operations related to Microsoft Office, the risk of these being malicious seems low.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's important to monitor such activities, especially when dealing with system processes, in this case, everything appears normal. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors across the batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file creation activities by Microsoft Office-related processes, indicating normal operation rather than malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's start by looking at the data provided.\n\nEach event in the JSONL file has three main parts: process information, windows log task details, and file path details. The process name is always \"SDXHelper.exe\", which seems consistent across all entries. The task in the winlog is consistently a file creation event, specifically \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". \n\nLooking at the files being created, they all follow a similar pattern in their paths. They are located under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\... and each has a filename that starts with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by different hash-like suffixes. These hashes vary slightly between entries, but the structure remains consistent.\n\nNow, thinking about what's normal: Applications like Microsoft Office often create temporary or cache files when they run. The fact that SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple files in an OfflineFiles directory suggests it's part of the Office setup or updates. Each file with a unique hash suffix might be different string resources being cached for AI Copilot features, which is standard for modern office applications.\n\nConsidering potential malicious activity: I don't see any indicators here that point towards something suspicious. The process name isn't commonly associated with malware as far as I know. Additionally, the repeated creation of files in an expected location doesn't raise red flags. If this were a malicious process, it might show different behavior like creating files in unexpected locations or attempting to hide its activities.\n\nThe number of events—16 in total—is significant but could be explained by the application generating multiple cache files during initialization or updates. Each file creation is logged separately, which is normal for such operations.\n\nNo signs of unusual access patterns, such as files being created at odd hours or rapid successive writes that might indicate a data exfiltration attempt. All events seem to happen in sequence without any irregular timing.\n\nPotential concerns: The only thing slightly notable is the consistent repetition of file creation by the same process, but again, this aligns with typical application behavior, especially for features like AI Copilot which require various resources loaded on demand.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no evidence from these logs to suggest malicious activity. They appear to be standard operations performed by a legitimate Office component.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe under a Microsoft Office directory, which is likely part of normal Office application behavior for caching AI Copilot resources.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events provided in JSONL format. Each line represents an event with some details about processes and file operations. My task is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first event shows \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file at a path ending with .winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems related to the log management tool itself, possibly updating its configuration file. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nThen, I notice multiple events from \"SDXHelper.exe\". Each of these is also a file creation event, and all the files are in the same directory under the Office SolutionPackages folder. The filenames seem repetitive with various hashes at the end. This pattern makes me think that SDXHelper is creating multiple small files, possibly related to its operation.\n\nI recall that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is associated with Microsoft's Excel add-ins and Copilot features. These are legitimate components used for enhancing Excel functionality, especially with AI-based features like Copilot. The repeated file creation events might be part of how these add-ins cache data or store temporary files during use.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to the same package GUID: 82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b. This suggests that all these files are related to a specific Office add-in or feature. The filenames include \"excel-copilot-strings\" followed by different hash values, which likely indicates language strings for Copilot in Excel.\n\nNow, considering the context of cybersecurity, I need to assess whether such activity is normal or could indicate malicious behavior. Legitimate software updates and cache activities are common and usually not indicative of an attack. The fact that multiple files are being created with similar names but different hashes might just be part of how Copilot handles its resources.\n\nI should also consider if there's any deviation from expected behavior. Since all events involve the same process (SDXHelper.exe) and target a known Microsoft Office-related directory, it doesn't raise red flags for me. There's no evidence of privilege escalation, unusual file permissions, or attempts to access sensitive areas outside the user's profile.\n\nAdditionally, there's only one event from winlogbeat.exe creating its own configuration file, which is standard for log management tools. It doesn't interact with any other processes in an unusual way.\n\nIn terms of indicators of compromise (IoCs), I don't see any known malicious process names or file hashes here. The paths are within standard user directories, and the operations are typical for software components that require temporary storage or caching mechanisms.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that sometimes attackers might hide their activities within legitimate processes. But in this case, since all activities point to well-known Microsoft Office components and their associated files, the risk of misuse is low.\n\nConsidering confidence levels, I'd say about 0.85. While there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, the volume and repetitive nature could be a minor concern if the number of file creations exceeds normal operational needs. But given that these are Copilot-related strings, it's more likely part of legitimate updates or cache operations.\n\nIn conclusion, after reviewing all events, I don't find any clear signs of malicious behavior. The activities align with expected behavior from Microsoft Office add-ins and log management tools.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate file creation operations by winlogbeat.exe and SDXHelper.exe, which are associated with log management and Excel Copilot functionality respectively.

Let me take a closer look at what's going on here.\n\nEach event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. Looking at the structure, they all seem similar. The \"process\" field indicates that the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\". That sounds familiar—it might be related to some legitimate software or maybe something else. \n\nThe \"winlog\" field shows that the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means each event is logging a file creation. So, this isn't an error log but rather a notification of a new file being made.\n\nNow, looking at the \"file\" path, it's pointing to various JavaScript files inside an Office-related directory. The paths are under \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\\\\...\" and then specific package resources with filenames like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_XXXXX.js\". \n\nHmm, the fact that multiple files are being created by the same process is interesting. Each file has a different hash-like suffix in its name (like 116192b56c4aa...), which suggests they might be unique or part of some distribution.\n\nSo, I'm wondering if this is normal behavior for the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process. If it's related to Office, maybe these are legitimate files being downloaded or cached as part of an update. But considering that there are multiple entries with different file names and all created by the same process, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nOne thing I'm thinking about is whether this activity is out of the ordinary for the system. If \"SDXHelper.exe\" isn't known to create many files quickly or in that specific directory, then this batch might be worth investigating. Alternatively, if this is part of a legitimate update process, it could be normal.\n\nAnother angle is the number of events. There are 14 entries here, each showing a file creation by the same process. That's quite a few in one go. If \"SDXHelper.exe\" typically creates files, how many would it create under normal circumstances? \n\nI'm also considering if these JS files could be part of malicious activity, such as loading scripts that are being generated dynamically. Malware sometimes drops multiple components or logs activities by creating several files quickly.\n\nTo sum up, the key points are:\n1. Process: SDXHelper.exe\n2. Task: File creation events (14 in total)\n3. File paths lead to Office-related directories with JS files\n\nI need to classify whether this batch is interesting for investigation or not. Given that multiple identical file creation events by the same process might indicate something unusual, especially if \"SDXHelper.exe\" isn't expected to create many files at once.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying it as \"INTERESTING\" because while some of these activities could be normal, the volume and specific path suggest potential malicious behavior.

The task is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at each event, they all seem similar. Each one has a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\". The Windows log indicates that a file was created, following a specific rule called FileCreate. The file paths are all under the same directory but with different filenames. For example, some files end with .min_2def6b10153b27beec92e9157342c4f9.js and others have different hashes.\n\nHmm, \"SDXHelper.exe\" sounds familiar.

Since they're all under the same parent directory and have similar filenames, it looks like multiple JavaScript files are being created during an installation or update process. The varying hashes in the filenames likely indicate different resource files for the Office AI Copilot feature.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here.

They all have similar structures: the process name is always \"SDXHelper.exe\", the Windows log task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the file path points to various .js files within a specific directory structure under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local... The file paths are consistently following a pattern, like \"...officeaicopilot-strings.min_ followed by different hashes each time.\n\nI notice that each event is identical except for the file path's hash part. It looks like multiple .js files are being created in quick succession by the same process. SDXHelper.exe is commonly associated with legitimate Microsoft Office updates or components, so seeing this process write files isn't unusual on its own.\n\nThe repetition of similar events makes me think it's a normal operation during an update or cache refresh. The system might be downloading and writing several JavaScript files as part of the Office package resources. The same file paths and process name reinforce that this is likely legitimate activity.\n\nI should consider if there's any red flag here. Since all these events are consistent, from the same source, and relate to expected behavior (file creation by an Office-related process), it doesn't raise immediate suspicion. There's no variation in user IDs or locations, which could hint at malicious activity.\n\nHowever, since all events are exactly the same except for the file hashes, they might be part of a bulk write operation, but that's still within normal operations if the system is updating or initializing resources.

Each event has a file path pointing to different JavaScript files within an Office SolutionPackage directory under the user's AppData folder. The filenames vary but they all follow a pattern like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_[some_hash].js\". \n\nAt first glance, it looks like multiple JS files are being created by this process. I'm wondering if SDXHelper.exe is part of normal Office operations. Maybe it's related to updates or cache files for the AI Copilot feature in Microsoft Office. Since these are strings.min files, they might be localized string resources used by the application.\n\nNow, why are there so many entries? It seems like each event creates a different JS file, but some duplicates appear. For example, I notice that \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_4726a43d02d002f8ddd67945b7245415.js\" appears twice, and similarly for others. This duplication could be normal if the process is retrying or handling multiple files in a loop.\n\nConsidering that these are file creation events by an Office-related process, it doesn't immediately raise red flags. However, the volume of such events might be worth noting. If this activity is part of a legitimate update or cache refresh, then it's expected. But if it's happening outside normal user behavior, especially in large quantities, it could indicate something malicious.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is known for such activities. Maybe looking up the file name and its publisher would help determine if it's a standard part of Office or something else. If it's not recognized as a legitimate component, then multiple writes to the filesystem might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the path structure is deep within the user profile, which isn't uncommon for application data, but combined with the repeated file creation, it's worth monitoring. The fact that each event is almost identical except for the filename hash makes me think it's a script or automated process writing multiple files quickly.\n\nIn terms of risk assessment, unless there's evidence that SDXHelper.exe is associated with malware, these events might not be malicious.

Maybe Microsoft Office since I see paths under Microsoft\/Office in the file paths.\n\nEach event is a \"File created\" task according to winlog. So SDXHelper is creating files. The files are all in the same path, within OfflineFiles. The filenames vary but they have similar patterns: officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by various hashes.

This duplication might just indicate that these files were created more than once, perhaps during different sessions or updates.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, it's a series of legitimate file creation activities by a known process within an expected location. No signs of unauthorized access, strange paths, or unusual timestamps here. The repetition could be normal if the system is updating or caching these files periodically.\n\nI don't see any indicators of compromise like writes to unexpected directories, changes in file hashes that shouldn't repeat, or other anomalies.

So, first off, looking at the JSONL data provided, each line represents an event. The process name in every event is \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's consistent across all entries.\n\nThe task in each winlog entry says it's a file creation event, specifically under the rule FileCreate. So, what does that mean? Well, SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar—it might be related to Office add-ins or some kind of system tool. I remember that sometimes legitimate software uses such names for helper processes.\n\nEach event has a file path pointing to different JS files within the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory under the user's AppData folder. The paths are long and include various hashes in their filenames, like officeaicopilot-strings.min_b073bf860080b51dd95889317aadf7d4.js. This looks like it's related to Office's offline files or some strings used by AI copilot features.\n\nNow, considering that all these events are file creation attempts by the same process and in a standard Microsoft Office directory, it seems plausible that this is part of normal Office operations. These might be components being downloaded or cached for use with the AI features in Office, especially since they're under SolutionPackages and OfflineFiles.\n\nI should also think about whether repeated file creations could indicate something malicious. However, in this case, all events are from the same process creating files in a legitimate location. There's no evidence of unusual access times, multiple processes involved, or attempts to execute these files outside their expected use.\n\nAdditionally, if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known helper for Office add-ins, then generating several JS files could be part of its setup or update routine. It wouldn't necessarily be suspicious unless there are other red flags like unexpected locations or irregular file hashes.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the same process creating multiple files in a standard directory related to Microsoft Office features doesn't raise immediate red flags. Therefore, this batch might not be interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions by the SDXHelper.exe process within a standard Microsoft Office directory.

The first thing I notice is that all the events are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in specific paths. \n\nThe paths point to Office Solution Packages and OfflineFiles directories. These locations are typically where Microsoft Office stores resources for features like Copilot. It makes sense for these files to be created as part of normal Office operations, especially if someone is using features that require offline access or cached data.\n\nEach event shows the creation of a JavaScript file with various hashes in their filenames. The fact that multiple files are being created with different hash suffixes suggests it's related to loading different resources or versions of scripts used by Office applications like Word and Copilot.\n\nSince \"SDXHelper.exe\" is associated with legitimate Microsoft processes, and the actions described (file creation) align with expected behavior for resource management in Office apps, there doesn't seem to be any malicious intent here. It's more likely just part of how Office handles its data and features.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access or unusual activities like file deletions, modifications without reason, or attempts to execute these files. All events are about creating new files in standard locations, which is normal for an application updating or initializing its resources.\n\nTherefore, while the volume of events might be notable (14 instances), each one individually and collectively fit within typical Office operations.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Each line is a separate event with the same structure. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, each event has three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file path data. The process name in all cases is \"SDXHelper.exe\". This seems consistent across all entries.\n\nThe task from the Windows log is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which tells me that a new file was created each time this event occurred. So, every line represents a file creation event.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to the same directory structure but different filenames. The path starts with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\" followed by various .js files. Each subsequent event increments the file name slightly, as seen in the hashes and versions at the end of each path.\n\nSo, what's going on here? It seems that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating multiple JavaScript files within a specific directory under the user's AppData folder. This could be normal if this process is part of legitimate software operations, such as installing or updating an application. However, since all events are identical in structure and only vary by filename, it might indicate批量文件创建行为，这在某些情况下可能是恶意软件试图写入大量临时文件或配置文件。\n\nBut wait, let's consider what \"SDXHelper.exe\" is. I'm trying to recall if this process is known for anything malicious. From my knowledge, SDXHelper is often associated with Microsoft Office add-ins or updates, particularly related to the AI Copilot features introduced in recent Office versions. These files being created under OfflineFiles might be part of the package resources for the Copilot feature, which caches strings and other assets locally.\n\nHowever, the fact that so many files are being created in quick succession could raise a flag. While legitimate software updates do create files, an unusually high number or repeated attempts might indicate something suspicious, like a script generating numerous temporary files or an attempt to bypass certain file creation limits.\n\nAnother point is the naming convention of the files: they all end with .js and have unique hashes in their filenames. This could be part of versioning or caching mechanisms, but it's worth checking if such behavior is typical for SDXHelper.exe. If this process isn't supposed to create so many files at once, then this batch might indicate something abnormal.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility of a file injection attack, where an attacker uses legitimate processes to write malicious scripts. The use of .js files could be part of such an attack vector since JavaScript is commonly used in web applications and can sometimes be exploited for malicious purposes.\n\nMoreover, all these events are generated by the same process, which might suggest that this process has been compromised or is running with elevated privileges, allowing it to write multiple files quickly. Alternatively, it could be a legitimate update process gone rogue, perhaps due to a bug or misconfiguration.\n\nTo further analyze, I'd check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known for such behavior. If it's not part of the standard Office package and instead is a third-party tool or newly installed software, that might increase suspicion. Additionally, correlating these events with other logs (like process creation times) could help determine if this activity happened in response to user actions or triggered automatically without user intervention.\n\nAnother angle is the use of the \"FileCreate\" rule in Windows logs. If this rule is being hit excessively by a single process, it might be a sign of potential abuse. Monitoring tools often flag such patterns as potentially malicious because attackers may create numerous files to hide data or spread across the system.\n\nI'm also thinking about the file paths and whether they're typical for Office-related processes. The path seems deep into the user's AppData folder, which is common for application settings and temporary files. However, the specific directory name \"OfflineFiles\" might be a clue. This could relate to an offline mode feature where certain resources are cached for use when online access isn't available.\n\nBut again, the volume of these events in one batch suggests something out of the ordinary. Legitimate processes usually create a few necessary files during installation or updates, not multiple ones in quick succession unless it's part of a bulk update process.\n\nIn conclusion, while on the surface this might look like legitimate file creation by an Office-related helper process, the sheer number and repetition make me cautious. It could be an indication of malicious activity attempting to write numerous files using a known process name or exploiting its privileges. Without more context or additional logs showing the sequence and timing of these events, it's challenging to definitively classify this batch as suspicious or not.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by SDXHelper.exe targeting the same directory with varying JavaScript files may indicate unusual activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

So, looking at the JSONL data provided, I see that there are multiple entries, each with a similar structure. Each event has three main components: process info, windows log task, and file details.\n\nFirst off, all these events have the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's a red flag because if a single process is creating multiple files in quick succession, it might indicate something suspicious. I'm thinking maybe this could be part of normal operations, but considering the context, it's worth looking into.\n\nNext, each event reports that a file was created. The task in the windows log is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so that's consistent across all events. Now, looking at the file paths, they're all located under different subfolders within the same parent directory. The paths are:\n\n- C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\[some GUID]\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\ followed by various filenames.\n\nThe filenames have a pattern: \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by some hash-like strings, and another set for \"word-copilot.min_\". This repetition makes me think these might be related to the same application or component. It's possible that this is part of an Office update or something similar where multiple files are being written.\n\nHowever, I'm noticing that each file path under \"PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\" is unique but follows a naming convention with varying suffixes. The duplication in the events (each filename appears twice) could be normal if the system is trying to write these files and maybe failed or retried, but it's also something an attacker might do.\n\nI'm wondering if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. A quick mental note tells me that SDXHelper.exe is often associated with the Microsoft Office suite, specifically handling updates or package resources. So, in that case, these file creations would be part of normal operations. But why are there so many files being created? Maybe an update is installing multiple components.\n\nOn the other hand, if this process is behaving abnormally, such as creating too many files quickly or writing to unexpected locations, it could indicate malware activity. The fact that all events come from the same process and involve file creation in a similar path raises my suspicion slightly.\n\nAnother angle: each event is identical except for the filename. That's another red flag because if an attacker wanted to write multiple malicious files, they might generate unique names or use different patterns. But legitimate processes can also create many files, especially during installations or updates.\n\nI'm thinking about how confident I am in classifying this as either interesting or not. Since SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process and the paths point to Office resources, it's likely part of an update or package installation. However, the number of events and their duplication might still warrant closer inspection. Maybe there's an issue with the update process or some other system instability causing repeated writes.\n\nIn conclusion, while the activities seem somewhat normal, the volume and exactness of the file creation events make me lean towards classifying this batch as interesting but not necessarily malicious. It could be a legitimate operation gone awry, or it might indicate something else. My confidence is around 0.7 because I'm fairly sure about the legitimacy but there's still enough uncertainty to merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events from the same process targeting similar paths suggest potential malicious activity or a legitimate update\/installation issue.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
