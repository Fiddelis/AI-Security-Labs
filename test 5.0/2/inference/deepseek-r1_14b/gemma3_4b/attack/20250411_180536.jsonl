The logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate event.\n\nLooking through the events:\n\n- There are multiple entries where chrome.exe is making network connections and DNS queries. That's pretty standard behavior for a browser, especially if someone is browsing the web. Not immediately suspicious unless it's accessing known malicious domains, but that's not indicated here.\n\n- I see powershell.exe appearing several times with ProcessAccess events. Powershell can be used both legitimately and maliciously. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times might raise an eyebrow, especially if there are other indicators of compromise like unusual command lines or failures to access restricted resources. But in this case, the logs don't show any specific commands or actions beyond process access.\n\n- cmd.exe is also appearing, with a command line that looks like it's creating a service using sc.exe. The command line seems legitimate; it's setting up a new service to start automatically. However, the fact that it's doing so might be part of an installation routine or potentially a persistence mechanism for malware. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\n- There are several events where services.exe and sc.exe are creating services and modifying the registry. Again, these could be legitimate system operations, especially during software installations or updates. However, repeated writes to the registry might indicate some form of persistence or configuration changes by malicious software.\n\n- The last few entries show various .exe files loading images from known system directories like Windows\/System32 and Microsoft.NET. These look like normal process behavior as they load necessary libraries. There's nothing immediately suspicious here unless these modules are being loaded in an unusual way or from unexpected paths.\n\nPutting it all together: Chrome's network activity is expected, Powershell access could be a red flag but not necessarily so without more context, command and service creation using cmd.exe and sc.exe might indicate something, and the image loads seem normal. The combination suggests potential malicious activity, especially with multiple process creations and registry modifications, which are common in persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, there's no clear evidence of actual malicious behaviorâ€”no failed access attempts, no known bad file paths, just some potentially suspicious activities that could also be part of legitimate processes or misconfigurations. So the confidence level isn't very high, maybe around 0.6, but it's enough to consider this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple process creations and registry modifications involving potentially suspicious commands like Powershell.exe access, cmd.exe service creation, and repeated sc.exe activity. These could indicate malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting enough for further investigation or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at each event individually. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The keys are \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". \n\nStarting with the first event:\n- Process: 'estrutura_principal.exe'\n- Winlog task: Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\n- File path: C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\clrjit.dll\n\nThis looks like a normal process loading a known DLL file, which is part of the .NET framework. Nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext event:\n- Process: 'cmd.exe'\n- Winlog task: Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\n- File: None\n\nRegistry modifications can be common and might not always be malicious, but they could indicate something like persistence mechanisms. I'll keep this in mind.\n\nThird event:\n- Process: 'conhost.exe'\n- Task: Registry value set\nAgain, conhost is a legitimate Windows process. If it's writing to the registry, it could be part of normal operations or an attempt to hide processes, but more context needed.\n\nFourth event:\n- 'elemento_ativo.exe' accessing the registry. Another potential for concern since this process name sounds suspicious (maybe malicious), and modifying the registry is a common tactic for persistence.\n\nFifth event:\n- 'modulo_secundario.exe' setting a registry value. The name suggests secondary module, which might be part of legitimate software or could be malicious.\n\nSixth event:\n- 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file: .winlogbeat.yml.new in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is an ELK tool for log management; it's likely just setting up its configuration file. Not suspicious unless the path looks odd, but here it seems normal.\n\nSeventh and eighth events:\n- 'powershell.exe' again with registry writes and process access. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers, so any unusual activity could be red flags. However, legitimate admins also use it, so context is needed.\n\nNinth event:\n- Another 'winlogbeat.exe' creating the same file as before. Consistent with setup activities.\n\nTenth to fourteenth events:\n- Various processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, and Calculator.exe performing registry writes or loading images. Most of these are legitimate Windows processes; however, svchost.exe is a common one used by malware as well because it's part of the system.\n\nLooking at all events together:\n- Multiple instances where .exe files (cmd.exe, conhost.exe, elemento_ativo.exe, etc.) are modifying the registry. This could indicate an attempt to create persistence or modify system settings.\n- The use of powershell.exe multiple times with registry access is concerning, as it's a common vector for attacks.\n- 'modulo_secundario.exe' and 'elemento_ativo.exe' have names that seem non-standard, which might be indicators of malicious processes.\n\nHowever, some events are clearly legitimate:\n- Winlogbeat creating files is expected behavior.\n- Processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe performing their usual tasks (loading DLLs, registry access) are normal.\n\nThe key points to consider for classification:\n1. Are the suspicious activities enough to warrant investigation?\n2. Is there a pattern that suggests malicious behavior?\n\nI notice several events where legitimate processes are accessing or modifying the registry, which isn't unusual on its own but could be part of an attack chain. The use of powershell.exe multiple times stands out because it's often used in attacks for execution and persistence.\n\nThe combination of multiple registry writes from different processes might indicate an attempt to establish persistence across reboots or modify system configurations to hide malicious activities.\n\nTherefore, while not all events are suspicious, the overall batch shows enough concerning behavior that could be indicative of malicious activity. The confidence is moderate because some events are legitimate but others raise flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry writes by different processes may indicate potential malicious activities or persistence mechanisms. Powershell's involvement and suspicious process names add concern.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
