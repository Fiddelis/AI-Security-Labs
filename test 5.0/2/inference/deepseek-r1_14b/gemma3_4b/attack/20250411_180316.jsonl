{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of different processes being logged. There are entries for schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, and chrome.exe. The tasks mentioned include Image loaded, Registry object added\/deleted, Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create.\n\nI know that many of these processes are common and legitimate on Windows systems. For example, svchost.exe is a standard system process, cmd.exe and powershell.exe are often used for scripting and administrative tasks. Chrome.exe's entries about loading DLLs like amsi.dll seem normal too since those are part of Microsoft's own security features.\n\nLooking at the actions, things like Registry value sets or Image loads can be part of normal operations. Schtasks.exe is related to scheduled tasks, which could be either legitimate or part of malicious activities if misused, but in this case, it's just noted as an image load.\n\nPowershell.exe appears multiple times with different log types, but without seeing the actual commands executed, it's hard to say if they're suspicious. However, powershell is commonly used for both good and bad purposes, so isolated instances don't necessarily indicate malicious behavior unless there are specific indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' process running with its command line seems benign as it's typically used to check user information without any harmful intent.\n\nI also see repeated entries for cmd.exe with the same \"\/c\" parameter. This could be part of a script or batch file execution, which isn't inherently malicious but can be if used in certain ways. However, again, without more context on what commands are being executed, it's hard to flag this as suspicious.\n\nThe presence of multiple Registry events from various processes suggests normal system activity rather than any coordinated attack or malicious behavior. Similarly, the Process Create and Access tasks don't indicate anything beyond standard operations unless there's an unusual spike or specific process names that stand out, which I don't see here.\n\nIn summary, while each individual event might look a bit concerning at first glance, collectively they seem to represent normal system operations without any clear signs of malicious activity. There's no indication of compromised processes, unauthorized access, or data exfiltration in this batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are a mix of common and legitimate system activities such as process creation, registry modifications, and image loads.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there's an event where WMIC.exe loaded MpOAV.dll. That sounds a bit suspicious because I know thatWMIC can be used maliciously, especially when combined with other processes. The file path for the DLL seems legitimate, but sometimes attackers might try to hide their malicious code within such files. So this is something to note.\n\nNext, I see several events where different processes like notepad.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe, and conhost.exe are setting registry values. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware. The fact that multiple legitimate-looking processes are making these changes might indicate some kind of activity, but individually they could just be normal operations.\n\nThen there's an event with powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is often used for malicious activities because it's so powerful. Process access can be part of lateral movement or data exfiltration, so this could be concerning.\n\nLooking further, I spot a cmd.exe command that copies an executable and renames it. The command line shows \"copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". This seems suspicious because replacing system executables can indicate tampering or installation of backdoors.\n\nAnother cmd.exe event runs a schtasks command to delete a scheduled task: \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\". Deleting tasks might be part of cleaning up traces of malicious activity, which is a common tactic in attacks. Additionally, another process uses schtasks.exe directly with the same parameters, which could mean someone is trying to remove something they shouldn't.\n\nThere are multiple entries where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. This repetition makes me think that this might be part of an attack chain—using legitimate tools for malicious purposes. The fact that whoami.exe is run without any arguments doesn't seem too suspicious on its own, but when combined with the other activities, it adds to the context.\n\nPutting all these events together: multiple instances of process creation (especially cmd.exe and powershell.exe), registry modifications, file copying and deletion of scheduled tasks. These are classic indicators of potentially malicious activity. It looks like someone might be setting up persistence mechanisms, deleting logs or tasks to cover their tracks, and using legitimate tools in a way that's unusual.\n\nThe confidence level isn't super high because some activities could be benign, but the combination is concerning enough to warrant investigation. So I think this batch is definitely interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including process creations (cmd.exe, powershell.exe), registry modifications, file copying, and deletion of scheduled tasks suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst event is RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because many Windows processes interact with the registry for configuration.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing something. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I'll keep an eye out for what it does here.\n\nNotepad.exe also sets a registry value. Notepad is usually harmless, but any program writing to the registry could indicate configuration changes.\n\nCalc.exe loads urlmon.dll. That file is part of Windows system files, so that's normal unless there's something suspicious about how it's being used.\n\nsvchost.exe setting registry values again—another common process, often part of services, so not immediately concerning on its own.\n\nCalculator.exe loading urlmon.dll seems okay; same as calc.exe.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. That's likely related to log shipping and is normal if that service is running.\n\nPowershell.exe accessing again, but without more context, it's hard to say here.\n\nWhoami.exe running with no suspicious command line—it's a standard system tool for getting user info, so probably fine.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying registry; this process is part of the shell, so normal behavior.\n\nAnother Calculator.exe setting a registry value—nothing jumps out.\n\nPowershell.exe again in multiple events. The number of times it appears makes me wonder if there's something under the hood. Maybe some script running?\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe event where it runs \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". That command is deleting Notepad processes, which could be legitimate or trying to cover tracks.\n\nThen WMIC.exe executing a similar command: \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". Multiple deletions of notepad.exe might indicate an attempt to remove traces or stop something running. If Notepad was doing something malicious, this could be part of a cleanup.\n\nAlso, the WMIC.exe loading urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. AMSI is related to antivirus and anti-malware scanning. Loading such files can sometimes be an indicator of malicious activity trying to bypass detection.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe running commands that delete processes (notepad.exe) could be part of a script or automated process trying to hide something. The use of WMIC, which is often used in command-line attacks for persistence, combined with registry modifications across various processes raises some red flags.\n\nThe confidence level isn't super high because each event on its own might not be suspicious, but the combination and frequency suggest potential malicious behavior aimed at process termination and possible system changes. So overall, this batch seems worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe executing commands to delete processes (notepad.exe) may indicate suspicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL logs, each line represents an event. My job is to analyze all these together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, a lot of them involve powershell.exe. Powershell can be legit for admins but also often used by attackers because it's powerful. So that's a red flag.\n\nIn some events, there are file operations like creating files in user directories (like AppData). That could indicate persistence mechanisms or malicious scripts trying to write files there, which is suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple registry modifications. Changing registry values can be part of installing malware or altering system behavior, so that's another point for being interested.\n\nI also notice several process creation events, especially with command lines running powershell scripts. These scripts check if certain .bat files exist and exit based on that. That sounds like a way to verify persistence or ensure malicious code runs only once, which is common in malware.\n\nThe repeated use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks might be part of loading components during startup, but the combination with powershell and other actions makes it seem more suspicious than just normal operations.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're spread across different directories, which could indicate a broader footprint. Some are in Windows system directories, which is concerning because altering system files can have serious consequences.\n\nAlso, some events show image loads for DLLs like mscoree and mscoreei, which might be related to executing code or obfuscating processes. This kind of activity can be part of hiding malicious behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell executions with command-line arguments, file creation in user directories, registry changes, and repeated checks for specific files. These are indicators of potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because several red flags align with common attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe execution with command-line arguments checking for file existence, combined with file creation in user directories and registry modifications, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events involve powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is commonly used in malicious activities due to its powerful scripting capabilities. But I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet; sometimes legitimate scripts use PowerShell too.\n\nLooking deeper into each event:\n\n1. The first event shows a command line with some encoded paths creating files and setting content to 'dir'. This looks suspicious because creating new files and writing content could be part of a script to execute commands or create persistence points.\n2. Subsequent events show powershell.exe accessing registry values and loading various .NET framework DLLs. While these activities can be normal, the combination with other actions might indicate something malicious, like trying to hide processes or load malicious components.\n3. Several events have 'Provider Lifecycle' task, which suggests that PowerShell is creating or managing event providers. This could be part of a technique to avoid detection by controlling logging behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple instances where powershell.exe creates files in different directories and modifies them with 'dir', which doesn't seem necessary unless the script is trying to create persistence mechanisms or setting up some automated tasks that might be harmful. The use of encoded paths and multiple file creations across various directories could indicate an attempt to spread malicious scripts across the system, making it harder to detect and remove.\n\nI'm also considering if this activity aligns with known attack patterns. Creating files in different locations and using PowerShell are common tactics in cyberattacks for persistence and lateral movement. The combination of these factors increases my suspicion that this batch is indeed indicative of malicious behavior.\n\nSo, after analyzing the entire batch, I classify it as INTERESTING because the activities show signs of potential malicious scripting with powershell.exe creating files and possibly evading detection mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating files in various directories and setting their content to 'dir' may indicate suspicious activity, potentially related to script injection or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events to determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. The command lines show things like creating files and setting content using Set-Content. That's something suspicious because attackers often create or modify scripts on the fly to execute malicious code.\n\nLooking at the tasks in winlog, there are several FileCreate events. Creating new files could be part of setting up persistence mechanisms or dropping malware components. The paths mentioned, like C:\\modulo_base\\objeto_logico, seem arbitrary but might indicate an attempt to spread across directories, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nThere's also a RegistryEvent where PowerShell and conhost.exe are accessing the registry. Malware often uses registry keys for persistence or to store configuration data. The fact that this happens multiple times increases my concern.\n\nAdditionally, there are ImageLoad events loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. While these might be legitimate, they're also commonly used by malicious scripts to load components. The repeated loading of these DLLs could indicate the script is doing something more complex or trying to hide its activity.\n\nThe deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1) is another red flag. Attackers often clean up their traces after executing malicious code, which helps avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of file creations, registry modifications, and cleanup activities suggests potential malicious behavior. The repeated use of PowerShell with suspicious command lines adds to the concern. While there's no direct evidence of harm, these actions are indicative of possible attack vectors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances creating and deleting files, accessing registry, and loading DLLs suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial events, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is loading images like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, etc. These seem normal because PowerShell often loads these components when running scripts. However, I should note if they're being loaded in an unusual way or from unexpected paths.\n\nNext, I see a file creation event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1 in the Temp directory followed by it being deleted immediately. This is suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection, maybe part of a script testing phase or cleanup after malicious activity.\n\nThere's also a file created in the Downloads folder named elemento_padrao.txt. That might be innocent, but without more context, it's hard to say. It could just be a user download or something else.\n\nThen there are several Registry value set events from chrome.exe. I'm not sure why Chrome would be setting multiple registry entries; maybe it's related to extensions or settings changes, but that in itself isn't necessarily malicious unless it's part of known bad behavior.\n\nLooking further down, there's a Pipe Created event from powershell.exe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, so this could be legitimate, but again, depending on the context, it might indicate some form of command execution or lateral movement.\n\nThe next events show powershell.exe being executed with specific command lines. The commands check if certain .bat files exist in particular directories. This behavior stands out because it looks like a script is testing for the presence of other scripts or files, which could be part of a persistence mechanism or payload delivery.\n\nAdditionally, there are more Image Load events from powershell.exe loading Defender-related DLLs. That's interesting because while Defender components are legitimate, sometimes attackers might load them to avoid detection by using legitimate processes.\n\nThere's another file creation event in the PowerShell StartupProfileData directory and some Registry writes. These could be part of script initialization or configuration changes, which might not be suspicious on their own but combined with other events could indicate malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances checking for files, creating temporary files that are quickly deleted, loading unusual modules, and making registry changes. This sequence suggests possible malicious behavior, possibly testing the environment before deploying something more significant or establishing persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes created files in the Temp directory that were immediately deleted, which may indicate script testing or cleanup.

I'm going to go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several events where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that check for the existence of specific .bat files. The paths in these commands seem a bit complex, but nothing immediately jumps out as suspicious. However, multiple checks for script files could be part of a larger activity, so I'll keep an eye on that.\n\nNext, there's an event where PowerShell loads MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That seems normal because defender processes often load various modules. Then, a file is created in the Temp folder named __PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1. Creating temporary files isn't unusual, but PowerShell scripts could be part of malicious activities, so this is something to note.\n\nAfter that, the same script file is deleted. File creation and deletion are common, but deleting a temp script quickly might indicate an attempt to avoid detection or leave fewer traces.\n\nThere's also a pipe created by PowerShell, which can be used for inter-process communication. While legitimate processes use pipes, it could also be a method for command-line attacks or lateral movement.\n\nAnother event shows the loading of MpClient.dll, again related to Defender, which seems normal. Then there's an event from winlogbeat creating a config file in the Downloads folder. That's probably just the tool running and setting up its configuration, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nPowerShell is accessing the Registry, which is common for scripting purposes but could also be part of malicious activities if it's modifying sensitive keys. Lastly, there's a process access event, which might indicate monitoring or interaction with other processes, potentially for malicious behavior.\n\nPutting this all together, multiple PowerShell instances are checking for and creating\/deleting script files, along with some suspicious file operations and registry activity. These actions don't necessarily confirm malicious intent but could be indicative of it. The confidence level is moderate because while the activities raise flags, they might also be part of legitimate system administration tasks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances checking for and interacting with script files in various locations, combined with file creation\/deletion patterns and registry access, suggest potential malicious activity or atypical system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nThe first few events are from powershell.exe. They mention tasks like Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, etc. The file paths seem normal, but I'm noticing that some files being created and then deleted might be part of a script or process. Powershell is often used for legitimate scripts but can also be malicious.\n\nThen there's an event where whoami.exe is run. That's usually harmless unless it's part of a larger attack to check permissions.\n\nLooking closer, the powershell events have command lines with if statements checking for file paths. The commands exit 0 or 1 based on whether certain files exist. This seems odd because normally you wouldn't just exit like that; perhaps they're testing for something.\n\nThe repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths suggest someone is trying to access a script related to keylogging, which could be malicious. The fact that it's checking multiple locations makes me think it's part of an attempt to find and execute such a script.\n\nPutting this together, the repeated use of powershell with these checks might indicate a potential attack. The script names like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 are red flags because they're commonly used for malicious activities, like keylogging or other surveillance purposes.\n\nI'm also noticing that some files are being created and then deleted, which is a common tactic to avoid detection.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are related to PowerShell and some other processes. The first event is 'whoami.exe' being executed, which on its own isn't too suspicious because it's a common utility used to check user information. However, when combined with other activities, especially involving PowerShell, it could be a red flag.\n\nNext, I see multiple events where PowerShell is being accessed and created. The command lines in some of these events are using 'Test-Path' commands to check for the existence of certain files. This behavior is interesting because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell to execute malicious scripts or check if specific files exist as part of a larger attack.\n\nThe tasks associated with these events include things like 'Process Create', 'Registry value set', and various image loads. The 'RegistryEvent' indicates that something is modifying the system's registry, which is another common activity in attacks because attackers might create or modify registry entries to persist their malicious activities.\n\nI also notice repeated attempts to access different files using PowerShell. Each event is checking a specific path with 'Test-Path', and if the file exists, it exits with 0; otherwise, it exits with 1. This repetitive pattern suggests that the script is trying to determine whether certain files are present on the system. If these files were part of malicious payloads, this could be an attempt to check for their existence before proceeding with further actions.\n\nAnother point is the multiple image load events related to .NET and DLLs being loaded by PowerShell. While legitimate applications do this, attackers often use these methods to execute code or load malicious libraries. The repeated loading of different DLLs might be a way to bypass some security measures or load components incrementally.\n\nConsidering all these together: the creation of processes (whoami.exe and multiple powershell.exe instances), registry modifications, file existence checks, and image loads—this combination raises concerns. It's possible that an attacker is using PowerShell for command execution, file operations, and persistence mechanisms. The repeated attempts to access specific files might indicate they're trying to execute something or ensure their malicious tools are in place.\n\nTherefore, while individual events might not be alarming, the overall pattern across all these logs suggests potential malicious activity, making this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes accessing and checking file paths, combined with registry modifications and image loads, suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

My task is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually and then see if there are any patterns or concerning behaviors when considering the whole batch together.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n- Event 1: powershell.exe accessed via ProcessAccess.\n- Event 2: whoami.exe created a process.\n- Events 3 and 4: Another powershell.exe access and a registry value set.\n\nThen, starting from event 5 onwards, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that check if specific files exist in certain directories. The paths seem to vary each time but follow a similar structure, like checking for .cs files in different folders.\n\nThe tasks associated with these events include ProcessCreate, ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, and ImageLoad. Notably, several events are marked under 'Provider Lifecycle', which might indicate something related to service or driver activity.\n\nNow, considering the entire batch:\n- The repeated use of powershell.exe is a red flag because it's commonly used in scripting for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n- The command lines contain conditional checks using Test-Path. These are typically used to verify if certain files exist. However, in an attack scenario, such checks could be part of a payload execution flow where the script verifies if components are present before proceeding with more malicious actions.\n- The variety of file paths being checked across different directories might suggest that the attacker is attempting to access multiple locations to find specific files, possibly indicating lateral movement or trying to locate sensitive information.\n\nAdditionally, the use of Powershell's command-line arguments and the fact that many events are related to process creation and image loading could be indicative of script execution. This could be part of a larger campaign where each check is a small piece of the puzzle.\n\nI don't see any obvious signs of immediate malicious activity like file deletions, registry modifications beyond what's typical for Powershell scripts, or direct network communications in these logs. However, the repetitive pattern of checking for files and using Powershell suggests potential nefarious intent. It might be part of a persistence mechanism or a precursor to an attack.\n\nGiven that cybersecurity often looks for anomalies or deviations from normal behavior, the extensive use of Powershell with such checks could warrant closer investigation.

There are multiple PowerShell processes running with various commands and actions. Let me go through them one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several entries where powershell.exe is loading images like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. Those files belong to Windows Defender, so that seems normal for the system to load them as part of their operation.\n\nNext, there are file creation events in temporary directories like C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. The filenames look like they're related to PowerShell script policy tests. This could be part of normal operations, especially if the user is running scripts or policies that need testing.\n\nThen I see a delete event for one of these temp files. Deleting test files after use isn't unusual but combined with other actions might raise a flag. \n\nThere are pipe creation events which PowerShell often uses for inter-process communication. This alone doesn't indicate malicious activity, as it's part of normal operations.\n\nLooking at the command lines, I see commands checking if certain .exe files exist and exiting based on that. These could be legitimate checks, maybe part of a script ensuring prerequisites are met before proceeding.\n\nRegistry value sets are another common action in logs.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, several events involve powershell.exe processes. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. The command lines in the process events are checking for the existence of specific .ps1 files. For example, \"Test-Path\" checks if \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" exists. If it doesn't, they exit with 0; otherwise, maybe they proceed. This behavior is suspicious because it could be part of a script that's trying to see if another malicious script is present.\n\nNext, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs, which is normal for Powershell scripts running in .NET environments. But combined with the process checks, it adds context that something might be attempting to execute code.\n\nThen, a FileCreate event creates a temporary PowerShell script \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1\" and immediately deletes it. This is concerning because creating and then deleting a script file could indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies or leave no trace of malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, the events show that powershell.exe is checking for different paths with variations in directory names like \"registro_base\", \"unidade_temporario\", etc. This suggests that the attacker might be trying multiple locations to see if their malicious script exists, possibly attempting persistence across different systems or configurations.\n\nThe last event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. While this could be normal for log collection tools, it's worth noting because sometimes attackers use legitimate-sounding tools for malicious purposes.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated checks for specific scripts, the temporary script creation and deletion, and the varied directory accesses indicate potential malicious behavior. The high number of powershell.exe processes with such activities increases the suspicion. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process events checking for specific script files, creating and deleting temporary scripts, and loading various DLLs suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. The events are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. There are 19 events here.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n- Event 1: chrome.exe doing a DNS query.\n- Event 2: powershell.exe accessing something.\n- Event 3: whoami.exe being run, which typically just tells you the current user.\n- Events 4 and 5 again involve powershell.exe accessing processes or registry.\n\nThen, I notice that starting from event 6, powershell.exe is creating a process with a command line that includes some PowerShell commands like \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\". This could be legitimate but might also be a sign of malicious activity because script blocks are often used in attacks.\n\nThere's a file being created and then deleted quickly. The path mentioned is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is a common temp directory. Creating and deleting files here can be part of malicious activities to avoid detection or create temporary scripts.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Image Load events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, which seems normal but could indicate that PowerShell is executing some code that requires these libraries.\n\nAnother point is the repeated Provider Lifecycle tasks in later events. I'm not entirely sure what those mean, but they might be part of how the system handles providers, perhaps related to PowerShell's operation.\n\nThe process command lines become more suspicious as they involve script blocks. The fact that a script is created and then deleted immediately could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving long-term traces.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows several red flags:\n- Multiple instances of powershell.exe being run with specific commands.\n- Creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file, which might be trying to bypass certain security policies or execute arbitrary code.\n- The repeated use of process creation events for powershell.exe could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or perform actions that require higher permissions.\n\nWhile some events on their own might not be alarming, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. The user running these commands might have unintended consequences, so it's worth investigating further to ensure there's no breach or ongoing attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances show suspicious command-line arguments and file operations that could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the batch of events provided is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are several instances where powershell.exe is running. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used for malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities. But not all powershell usage is bad—sometimes it's legitimate.\n\nI notice that in one event, powershell.exe created a file: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\". That seems unusual. I'm wondering why powershell would create a file there. Maybe it's part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use powershell to hide their tracks or execute malicious scripts.\n\nThere are also multiple events where powershell.exe is accessing processes (ProcessAccess). This could mean it's interacting with other running programs. If this happens frequently and without a clear reason, it might be suspicious.\n\nThen, I see whoami.exe being run twice. Whoami is typically used to display user information, which seems benign unless it's part of a larger script trying to gather system details for malicious purposes.\n\nNotepad.exe and calc.exe are standard Windows applications, so their activity alone doesn't raise red flags. However, notepad.exe setting a registry value could be interesting—maybe modifying system configurations in an unusual way.\n\nThe events involving svchost.exe are worth looking at too. Svchost is a common process for running services, but it's sometimes used by malware to hide their processes under the guise of legitimate system files. The fact that svchost.exe is setting registry values and making network connections could be concerning.\n\nLooking at the chrome.exe entries, there are multiple network connection attempts and DNS queries. While this might seem normal if someone is browsing the web, a high volume of connections without clear user activity could indicate something malicious, like data exfiltration or command and control communication.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe created a new configuration file in the user's downloads folder. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack for log management, so it should be legitimate. However, creating files in user directories might not be standard if it's unexpected behavior from that process.\n\nPutting all this together, I'm noticing several points of interest: multiple powershell.exe activities with file and registry interactions, whoami.exe runs, svchost.exe modifying system settings, and extensive chrome network activity. These could indicate potential malicious behavior. However, some of these actions could also be legitimate, especially if the user is running scripts or services normally.\n\nI'm not sure if all these events are part of a coordinated attack, but there's enough unusual behavior to warrant further investigation. The confidence level isn't extremely high because some of the activities might have benign explanations, but the combination does raise suspicions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple powershell.exe events, whoami.exe executions, and svchost.exe registry modifications, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first few entries, they all involve powershell.exe being executed with some command lines that include commands like 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse'. These are common PowerShell commands used to list files and directories recursively. But I should check if these commands are part of a legitimate script or if they're being used maliciously.\n\nI notice that the same process, powershell.exe, is appearing multiple times with similar command lines. This repetition might indicate a script running multiple times or perhaps an automated process, but it could also be part of a persistence mechanism used by malware. Powershell is often targeted by attackers because it's a powerful tool and can execute code directly on the system.\n\nLooking at the winlog events, tasks include things like 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Engine Lifecycle', 'Image loaded', etc. These are normal Windows events related to process creation and termination, so they don't immediately raise red flags. However, when combined with the powershell.exe processes, it's something to watch.\n\nOne event shows that powershell.exe accessed a file path: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. This could be part of normal PowerShell operations, but accessing non-standard paths might indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or retrieve sensitive data.\n\nThere's also an event where a file named 'estrutura_secundario.txt' was created in the Downloads folder. The naming doesn't suggest anything malicious at first glance, but the context matters. If this is part of a legitimate download, it's fine, but if it's generated by powershell.exe without user interaction, it could be suspicious.\n\nAnother event involves conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost.exe is typically used as a host for console applications and isn't inherently malicious, but its use alongside other potentially suspicious activities might warrant closer examination.\n\nI also notice that winlogbeat.exe is creating files in the data directory. Winlogbeat is an open-source tool for collecting and sending logs, so this seems normal unless it's behaving abnormally, which there's no evidence of here.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with file system and registry interactions could be a sign of malicious activity like persistence or data exfiltration. The combination of process creation, file access, and registry modifications is often seen in attack chains. Therefore, this batch should be classified as interesting because it raises potential red flags about possible unauthorized system access or malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially suspicious commands, accessing sensitive paths, and modifying the registry, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
