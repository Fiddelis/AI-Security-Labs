The first few entries are from chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries, which is normal. Then there's a PowerShell process starting with some commands that download files from GitHub. This catches my attention because downloading files from raw.githubusercontent could be suspicious.\n\nLooking closer, the PowerShell command downloads LICENSE.txt files to temp directories. That might be part of legitimate scripts, but the repeated calls from different GitHub repositories under various projects (objeto_base, modulo_temporario, unidade_base) seem unusual. It looks like multiple attempts to download files, possibly as part of a script testing or malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where PowerShell creates and then deletes temporary files. The creation and subsequent deletion could indicate an attempt to hide traces, which is a common tactic in malware or unauthorized access.\n\nThe combination of downloading files from GitHub and deleting them suggests potential malicious intent.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that several entries are using PowerShell to download files from GitHub. The command lines show repeated attempts to download LICENSE.txt files into the TEMP directory. This is a red flag because downloading files, especially via PowerShell, is commonly used in malicious activities like downloading payloads or scripts.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where Chrome is setting registry values. While legitimate software does modify the registry, multiple such events could indicate suspicious activity, possibly related to persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations without clear reason.\n\nThen, I see events involving conhost.exe modifying the registry. Conhost is often used in command-line operations, but again, repeated registry changes might be a sign of malicious behavior trying to hide traces or create persistence points.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management, so unless it's behaving abnormally, this might not be suspicious on its own. However, combined with other events, it could be part of a larger malicious process.\n\nAdditionally, there are DNS queries and process creations that don't seem immediately suspicious, but the volume and pattern of these activities, especially from PowerShell and Chrome, make me concerned about potential command-and-control (C2) communication or payload execution.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows multiple indicators that could be signs of malicious activity. The repeated downloads using PowerShell, registry modifications by both PowerShell and Chrome, and the creation of files in user directories are all concerning. These patterns suggest possible lateral movement, data exfiltration, or installation of malicious software.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity downloading files from GitHub, combined with registry modifications and file creations that may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell can be legitimate but is often used in attacks, so repeated activity could be suspicious. The tasks include file creation and registry changes, which might indicate malicious activity since attackers often modify the system's configuration.\n\nLooking at event 3, winlogbeat.exe creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file seems normal if it's part of log management setup, but I'm not entirely sure. It could be related to log shipping or configuration updates.\n\nIn events involving schtasks.exe and cmd.exe, there are attempts to delete tasks with command lines like SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn. This looks concerning because deleting scheduled tasks is a common tactic in attacks to remove traces of malicious activities or disrupt system functions.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process created, which is often used to check user permissions and might be part of lateral movement in an attack chain. The command line for cmd.exe with SCHTASKS suggests some scripting or automated task management, possibly indicating persistence mechanisms.\n\nRegistry modifications by various processes like powershell.exe, svchost.exe, and cmd.exe are another red flag. Attackers often use registry keys to maintain persistence between sessions. The fact that these changes happen multiple times across different processes makes me more cautious.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of unusual file creations, repeated process accesses with potentially malicious commands, and multiple registry modifications points towards possible malicious activity. While some events could be benign, the clustering around powershell.exe and schtasks.exe is worrying.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activities including Powershell executions, Registry modifications, and deletion of scheduled tasks suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few logs are all from powershell.exe with tasks related to image loading. They're loading various DLLs like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. That seems normal because PowerShell often loads these libraries when running scripts or commands.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Powershell creating temporary files isn't unusual, especially for script testing or execution. But then immediately after, that same file is deleted. This could be suspicious because why create and delete a script so quickly? Maybe it's trying to avoid detection by cleaning up traces.\n\nLooking further, there are events related to pipes being created and engine lifecycle events in PowerShell. These might just be part of normal operations when scripts run, especially if they're communicating with other processes or handling input\/output.\n\nThere's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its data directory. That makes sense because winlogbeat is likely setting up its configuration or data files as it runs, so that's probably not concerning.\n\nThen there are multiple registry value sets and process accesses from powershell.exe, conhost.exe, cmd.exe. Registry access can be part of normal script execution, but in combination with other actions, it might indicate something malicious like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe whoami.exe command is run, which isn't inherently bad, but if used in the context of trying to determine user permissions or lateral movement, it could be a sign of recon activity.\n\nAlso, cmd.exe is called with \"\/c \", which usually means executing a command and then terminating. The command line here seems empty, which might mean it's part of a larger script or process substitution.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple PowerShell instances loading modules, creating\/deleting temp files quickly, registry modifications, use of whoami and cmd.exe, and other system calls. These behaviors could indicate malicious activity like script testing to bypass policy, lateral movement, or setting up persistence.\n\nI'm leaning towards INTERESTING because the combination suggests possible malicious behavior rather than normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes loading libraries, creating and deleting temporary files quickly, accessing registry values, and using commands like whoami.exe and cmd.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. First, I notice that most of the entries are from processes like Calculator.exe, Chrome.exe, and multiple instances of powershell.exe. The tasks include things like Registry value sets, Pipe Created, Image loaded, File created, Process Create, etc.\n\nLooking at the commands, especially in powershell.exe, some command lines look suspicious. For example, there's a line where powershell.exe is used with \"& {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This seems like an attempt to delete a file without any error messages, which could be part of hiding activity.\n\nAdditionally, the frequency of Registry value sets from various processes might indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms. The use of whoami.exe is another red flag because it's often used by malware to check permissions or system info.\n\nPutting this together, there are several signs of potentially malicious behavior: deleting files in temp directories, multiple registry modifications, and using powershell.exe with specific commands that could be part of a payload execution chain.

The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event shows cmd.exe setting a registry value. That's normal since many system processes interact with the registry.\n2. Next, conhost.exe also sets a registry value. Conhost is often used for console windows, so this seems routine.\n3. Powershell.exe accessing a process—Powershell is commonly used and can have legitimate reasons to access processes.\n4. whoami.exe running without any unusual command line arguments. It's a standard tool for checking user information, so nothing suspicious here.\n5. Another powershell.exe process access. Again, this could be normal unless there are other indicators.\n6. Powershell setting another registry value. Maybe it's configuring something.\n7. A new powershell instance is created with an empty command line, which might be a bit odd but not necessarily malicious.\n8. More powershell processes accessing things and modifying the registry. This repetition could be a red flag if done multiple times without legitimate cause.\n9. Powershell loading various .NET framework components. Legitimate actions since Powershell relies on these libraries.\n10. A file creation in a temporary directory by Powershell. Creating temp files is standard, but the naming looks like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1\", which seems unusual and might indicate script execution or testing policies.\n11. The same file is deleted immediately after being created. Deleting temp files is normal, but the combination of creating and deleting could be part of malicious activity to avoid detection.\n12. ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting a registry value—this is related to Windows Store apps, so it's usually benign.\n\nPutting this together: Multiple powershell.exe processes are modifying the registry, accessing processes, loading various DLLs, and there's file creation\/deletion in temp folders. The repeated use of powershell with some empty command lines might suggest script execution or persistence mechanisms. The file operations could be part of a script testing permissions or trying to execute code.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because the pattern—multiple registry changes by different processes, especially powershell, along with temporary file handling—isn't typical user behavior and could indicate malicious activity like persistence scripts or credential dumping.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell accessing system components and performing file operations in a suspicious pattern suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a system. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if they indicate something malicious or at least worthy of further investigation.\n\nLooking through the events, I see that many of them are related to PowerShell.exe activities. The first few lines show Image Load tasks for various DLL files. That's normal because when applications run, they load necessary libraries. But then I notice some specific details. For example, there's a file creation and subsequent deletion of a PowerShell script in the TEMP directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1\". Creating and immediately deleting a script could be a sign of trying to bypass certain security policies or test if scripts are allowed.\n\nAlso, several events show attempts to remove files from the TEMP folder using PowerShell commands. These lines have command lines like \"Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\...\" which suggests that the system is trying to delete specific ZIP files. The fact that they're using \"& { ... }\" might be an attempt to execute multiple commands in one line, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point of interest is the repeated use of the same TEMP directory paths with different file names. This repetition could indicate a script or automated process trying multiple times or attempting to delete several files. It's a bit unusual because legitimate processes usually don't delete arbitrary files from TEMP unless they're cleanup routines, but combined with the PowerShell usage, it raises suspicions.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where Chrome.exe is involved. They load some DLLs and set registry values. While this isn't directly malicious on its own, the combination with the other PowerShell activities makes me think that maybe a script is using multiple vectors or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting all together: lots of PowerShell activity involving file creation\/deletion in TEMP, which can be indicative of malicious scripts trying to remove evidence or establish persistence. The repeated attempts to delete different files and the temporary script creation could be red flags. Also, the use of specific command-line arguments might suggest that it's part of a larger campaign or toolset used by attackers.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities including file creation and deletion in the TEMP directory, indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first few entries, there are multiple PowerShell processes removing files from the TEMP directory. The command lines show Remove-Item commands targeting specific .txt files. This seems suspicious because deleting files in TEMP can be part of malicious activities to cover tracks or remove evidence. However, sometimes legitimate scripts might do this too, so I need more context.\n\nNext, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its data directory. That doesn't seem unusual unless it's unexpected behavior from that tool, which I'm not sure about. Then, PowerShell loading MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender, isn't concerning on its own.\n\nThere are events where PowerShell creates files and accesses processes. The 'ProcessAccess' task could be normal administrative activity or something malicious trying to manipulate other processes. Also, there's a whoami.exe execution which is commonly used by attackers to check permissions, but it's also a standard command for system info.\n\nLooking further down, I see several Registry value sets from Chrome and RuntimeBroker. Chrome often writes to the registry for extensions or settings, so this might be normal unless there are unusual entries. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks could indicate something malicious, like persistence mechanisms, but without more data, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell commands deleting files in TEMP, whoami.exe runs, and several Registry modifications. These activities, while not conclusive on their own, taken together might suggest potential malicious behavior. The deletions in TEMP could be part of an attack trying to remove logs or evidence, and the Registry changes could be for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nHowever, there's a chance that some of these are legitimate admin tasks or script executions. Without more context, it's hard to be certain. But given the combination of events—especially the repeated deletions in TEMP and the use of whoami.exe—it leans towards being interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes deleting files, whoami.exe execution, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving PowerShell.exe. That's already a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for scripting and executing malicious commands. The first event shows that a file was created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That path seems a bit unusual; it's not somewhere I'd expect legitimate scripts to be placed.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances where registry values are being set by both PowerShell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can indicate persistence mechanisms, which attackers use to maintain access to systems after reboots. This is definitely concerning.\n\nLooking further, there are several events related to file deletions in the TEMP directory. Specifically, commands like Remove-Item are used to delete files named tarefa_base.txt, estrutura_ativo.txt, and unidade_base.txt. These filenames don't ring any bells as legitimate system files, so it's suspicious that they're being deleted.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events from PowerShell.exe, loading various DLLs. While PowerShell does load libraries when running scripts, the specific paths mentioned (like mscoree.dll and clr.dll) could be related to .NET framework usage. However, combined with other activities, this might suggest malicious script execution.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation followed by deletion of __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 in the TEMP directory. This filename looks like it's part of some test or persistence script. The fact that it was created and then deleted quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like a sequence of actions designed to execute scripts, modify system configurations for persistence, delete temporary files to cover tracks, and possibly load malicious code using the PowerShell environment. This combination raises significant red flags about potential malicious activity. The consistency in using PowerShell across multiple events is particularly concerning, as attackers prefer such tools for their versatility and stealth.\n\nOverall, the pattern of file operations, registry changes, and repeated use of PowerShell without clear legitimate context suggests a high likelihood of malicious intent. Therefore, this batch should definitely be classified as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe performing file operations, registry modifications, and deleting temporary files suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Powershell is a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously. However, seeing it accessed repeatedly without any file operations might just be normal admin activity or legitimate script execution.\n\nNext, there are several instances of whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is typically harmless and often used to check user permissions. The command line path looks standard, so unless there's something unusual in how it's called, this might not raise red flags.\n\nThen, towards the end, I see winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an agent used for log management, so its activity here seems normal as it would create configuration files during setup or updates.\n\nAlso, powershell.exe created a file named pacote_ativo.txt. The filename seems generic and without any obvious malicious indicators. Without additional context on the content of this file, it's hard to assess, but standalone file creation by Powershell isn't necessarily suspicious unless combined with other actions like network communication or deletion patterns.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there's a lot of process creations and accesses but no signs of privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or known malicious behaviors.
