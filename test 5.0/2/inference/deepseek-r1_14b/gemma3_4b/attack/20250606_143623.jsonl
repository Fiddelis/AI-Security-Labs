I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here.\n\nFirst, I see multiple events where the process name is 'svchost.exe' and the task is 'Registry value set'. That's unusual because svchost is commonly associated with legitimate services but can also be used by malware to hide their processes. The fact that it's setting registry values repeatedly might indicate some malicious activity, like installing persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there are a bunch of events from 'setup.exe' creating files in the EdgeCore directory. This seems suspicious because setup.exe running and creating files could mean an application is being installed or updated. But the specific paths and the number of files created over multiple events make me think it's not normal user activity—it might be part of an installer dropping malicious components.\n\nThere are also some ImageLoad tasks from 'setup.exe' loading system32 dlls, which could indicate that setup.exe is trying to load legitimate system libraries. But in combination with the file creation, this might be part of a broader attack where malicious code is integrating into the system.\n\nAnother event is RuntimeBroker.exe setting registry values, which is a bit concerning because Runtime Broker is tied to Windows Update and can sometimes be exploited by malware for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nPutting it all together, the repetition of svchost.exe modifying the registry, setup.exe creating multiple files in non-standard paths, and RuntimeBroker activity—all these points suggest potential malicious behavior.

So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing some system log event. My task is to analyze them all together and decide if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first line shows that powershell.exe accessed something with ProcessAccess. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this might be a red flag. Then there's whoami.exe running; usually, it's innocent, but sometimes attackers use it to check permissions.\n\nNext, another powershell.exe event accessing the registry—registry activity in scripts can be suspicious because attackers often create or modify registry keys for persistence or other malicious purposes.\n\nLooking further, there's a ProcessCreate event for powershell.exe with a command line that includes creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" and setting its binary path to some exe file. This is concerning because it suggests the creation of a new service, which could be part of installing malware or creating persistence mechanisms. The presence of a custom service name and an arbitrary exe as the binary path raises suspicion.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs. While this is normal for scripts using .NET frameworks, too many unusual modules might indicate malicious activity, but I can't be sure yet.\n\nAnother event shows FileCreate and then FileDeleteDetected for a PowerShell script in the Temp directory. This could mean that an attacker is trying to execute a script that's being deleted afterward to avoid detection. Alternatively, it might just be a test of script policy by legitimate software, but it's worth investigating because malicious scripts often do this.\n\nThere's also a PipeCreated event, which can allow communication between processes. This is another point in favor of possible malicious behavior since attackers might use pipes for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value sets from services.exe. Services.exe is part of Windows, but frequent registry writes without clear purpose could indicate an attacker modifying system configurations or creating persistence points.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows extensive powershell activity including service creation, file operations in Temp, and registry modifications. These behaviors can be signs of a script attempting to establish persistence, drop files, or modify system settings for malicious purposes. The combination is concerning because it's not just one isolated event but a series that suggests some kind of automated or malicious process.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the activities, while individually possible in benign scenarios, together indicate potential malicious behavior. The confidence isn't super high (maybe around 0.8) because there might be legitimate reasons for these actions, but the pattern is worrying.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activity including service creation, file operations in Temp, and registry modifications indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event with some process information, Windows logs, and possibly file details.\n\nFirst, the majority of the events are from 'svchost.exe', which is a known system process that's often used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. The actions logged include things like Registry value sets or changes—RegistryEvent tasks. Now, making changes to the Windows Registry isn't inherently suspicious, but multiple such changes in quick succession might indicate something malicious, especially if they're from processes that don't typically make those kinds of changes.\n\nLooking further down, there are events from 'services.exe' and 'setup.exe'. These are also system-related processes. The tasks here involve more Registry operations and some file creation events. For example, setup.exe is creating files like msedge_proxy.exe and pwahelper.exe in the Edge application directory. While this might seem normal for an installer or setup process, I'm a bit concerned because those specific files don't ring any immediate bells as legitimate components of Microsoft Edge. Plus, the paths look a bit off—like the 'Quick Launch' and 'Start Menu' entries being created by setup.exe.\n\nWait, but setup.exe is typically associated with installing software. So creating files and shortcuts might be normal during an installation. However, the number of events here seems high. There are multiple Registry modifications from different processes, which could indicate a script or tool making many changes to the system configuration. That's something that could be part of malicious activity, like setting up persistence points or altering security settings.\n\nAnother point is that there are both file creation and pipe creation events. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which might not be suspicious on their own but could be a way for malicious processes to communicate with each other. Also, the files created by setup.exe have paths that seem non-standard for typical system processes. For example, 'msedge_proxy.exe' and 'pwahelper.exe' aren't standard Edge components I can recall.\n\nBut wait, maybe these are legitimate updates or new features being installed. Microsoft Edge does update regularly, so perhaps these are parts of a newer version. Still, the fact that multiple Registry changes are happening across different processes could be a red flag. Malware often uses svchost.exe as a wrapper for its activities to blend in with normal system processes.\n\nPutting it all together: we have several instances where different system-related processes are making Registry changes and creating files in unexpected locations. The combination of multiple Registry operations, file creations in non-standard directories, and the use of known process names that can be malicious makes this batch seem potentially suspicious. However, without more context or additional indicators like timestamps showing rapid-fire activity, it's hard to be certain.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while some activities might seem normal at first glance, the volume and combination of events raise concerns that could indicate malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple Registry modifications and file creations by system processes may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is 'services.exe' performing registry value sets. That's not uncommon since services.exe is a legitimate Windows process used for running background services. Registry modifications by this process aren't inherently suspicious on their own unless they're doing something out of the ordinary, like writing to unexpected keys or in an unusual pattern.\n\nNext, there are several events involving 'tarefa_logico.exe'. This name seems a bit generic and could be part of various applications, but it's worth noting that it's loading multiple .NET framework components. While this might be normal for some legitimate applications that use the .NET runtime, I'm curious about why so many different files are being loaded. Could this indicate something malicious trying to establish persistence or load necessary components?\n\nThen there are entries involving 'powershell.exe' creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for scripting and execution. Creating files in startup directories could be an attempt to run scripts at login, which might be malicious if the script is doing something harmful.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where 'MsMpEng.exe' (which I believe is related to Windows Defender) sets a registry value. That doesn't immediately raise red flags since antivirus software often interacts with the registry for configuration purposes.\n\nSeveral entries show 'svchost.exe', another common process used by various system services and sometimes exploited by malware. The fact that it's setting registry values isn't unusual, but again, without more context on what exactly is being modified, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nAnother point of interest is the creation of a log file in 'C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate' by an unspecified process. Log files are normal, and their creation might just be part of standard Windows operations or updates.\n\nConsidering all these points together, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\". Most activities here seem to align with legitimate system processes performing normal tasks. However, the 'powershell.exe' creating a startup profile file is a bit concerning, but without more context on what that script does, it's hard to confirm malicious intent.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether there are any unusual patterns or repeated actions that might indicate something's wrong. For example, if 'tarefa_logico.exe' was loading an excessive number of .NET components, that could be a red flag, but the entries provided don't show such extremity. Similarly, multiple registry writes by services.exe and svchost.exe are within normal operating parameters.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are elements that raise mild curiosity, especially with powershell.exe's activity, the overall batch doesn't present clear signs of malicious behavior when considered as a whole.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of normal system processes performing routine tasks such as registry modifications and loading standard library files.

Temporary files aren't unusual, but their locations (like C:\\Windows\\Temp) and the naming convention (APPX.*) suggest they might be related to app deployment or updates. However, seeing multiple such files created by svchost.exe could indicate something more malicious, like file injection or persistence.\n\nAlso, the last event shows a file being created in \"C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness\\\" which seems unusual. AppReadiness isn't a standard directory I'm familiar with, and it might be an attempt to create a new system directory for some malicious purpose.\n\nPutting this all together, while individual events might not be alarming on their own, the combination—multiple registry changes from setup.exe, numerous temp files created by svchost.exe, and an unusual directory creation—raises concerns about potential malicious activity.

Next, I see Powershell being launched with a restricted execution policy but the command itself just writes to the host. The file loads in Powershell seem standard too, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are typical for .NET.\n\nNo signs of unusual file creations outside normal paths or any network activity, which is often a red flag.

All the events involve processes created by powershell.exe and whoami.exe. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, accessing other processes, and creating files in different directories like Temp and System32. This activity seems pretty typical for PowerShell scripts running, especially ones that might be checking system configurations or executing commands. The command line from one of the events shows a script trying to read .inf files in Windows' inf directory. That's a normal part of how some tools check for driver installations.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being run without any unusual flags—it's just getting the current user, which is standard and not suspicious on its own.\n\nI'm also noticing that several file paths point to legitimate system directories and Microsoft DLLs. There's nothing here indicating unauthorized access or malicious activities like known malware signatures or writes to unexpected locations.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe could raise an eyebrow if we didn't see such scripts regularly, but in this case, the actions are standard for administrative tasks or script execution.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at each event.\n\nEach line has three main components: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always 'Dism.exe', which I recognize as a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing operating systems, like enabling or disabling features. That's a good sign because it's a known Microsoft utility.\n\nThe winlog field in each event mentions \"File Executable Detected\" with the rule \"FileExecutableDetected\". This suggests that the system detected an executable file being accessed. It could be part of normal operations or something malicious, but I need to see more context.\n\nLooking at the files involved, all paths start with 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...' followed by various .mui files. MUI stands for Multilingual User Interface, which are language-pack files used in Windows for localization. The specific files listed (like DismCore.dll.mui, DismProv.dll.mui, etc.) seem to be related to the servicing stack.\n\nNow, considering that 'Dism.exe' is a legitimate process handling these MUI files during servicing operations makes sense. It's normal for Dism.exe to access these files as part of its operation when setting up or updating system components, especially during Windows updates or installations.\n\nI don't see any unusual behavior here. All events are consistent with expected activity from the Dism.exe process accessing language files in a temporary directory. There's no indication of file creation times, hashes, or other attributes that might raise red flags. Since all activities align with known legitimate processes and standard operations, there's minimal cause for concern.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't exhibit signs of malicious behavior and is likely part of normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve the Dism.exe process accessing legitimate language interface files (mui) in a temporary directory.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, looking at each JSON object, they all have the same structure: process name is Dism.exe, a Windows log task about detecting an executable file, and the file path varies but seems to be within a temp directory under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\". The files detected are various .dll.mui and .dll files with names like SmiProvider, SysprepProvider, TransmogProvider, etc.\n\nI know that Dism.exe is related to the Windows Deployment Image Service, used for servicing Windows images and deployments. It's a legitimate system process, so seeing it execute files isn't inherently suspicious. But I'm noticing multiple entries of the same type—each event shows Dism.exe detecting an executable file in this temp directory.\n\nThe paths all point to different providers, like FfuProvider, FolderProvider, GenericProvider, etc. These seem to be part of various system components or services that might be loaded during deployment operations. Since they're all under a temp folder created by the same user (fiddelis), it suggests this is related to an ongoing deployment or servicing operation.\n\nI don't see any anomalies here—nothing like unexpected paths, executables from outside legitimate sources, or indicators of malicious activity. The repeated detection might just be Dism.exe doing its normal job of handling these provider files during image processing.\n\nSo overall, while each event is logged as a file executable detected, the context and process are legitimate.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst event: A PowerShell process is loading the MpClient.dll file. That seems normal because PowerShell often loads various DLLs when running scripts or commands. I don't immediately see any red flags here, but it's worth keeping an eye on since PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nSecond event: cmd.exe is called with a command line that includes Dism with several switches. The command seems to be trying to disable the Windows Defender feature. That caught my attention because disabling antivirus\/anti-malware tools is often a step attackers take to lower system defenses. This could be an indication of malicious activity, but it's also possible that a user or script intentionally did this for some reason.\n\nThird event: Another PowerShell process accessing something, but no file details. Similar to the first event, I'm not sure if this alone is suspicious, but combined with others, it might be worth looking into.\n\nFourth event: Dism.exe creating a new process. Again, Dism is a legitimate tool used for servicing Windows, so its use isn't inherently malicious. However, when combined with disabling Defender and multiple file accesses, it might raise an eyebrow.\n\nLooking at events five through fourteen, each shows Dism.exe accessing various DLL files in a temporary directory. The paths seem to point to custom or lesser-known components, but without knowing more about the system's configuration, it's hard to say if these are normal. However, creating multiple files and accessing them could be part of legitimate operations, but it might also indicate that Dism is being used to deploy something malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch starts with attempts to load Defender-related DLLs via PowerShell, then uses cmd.exe to disable Windows Defender using Dism. Following that, there's a series of file accesses and creations by Dism in a temporary directory. This sequence—disabling antivirus followed by multiple file operations—is concerning because attackers often try to remove or bypass security measures before installing malware.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of disabling Defender and creating multiple files could indicate malicious activity. However, I need to consider if these actions are within normal user behavior. If a legitimate process were updating or servicing the system, it might do similar things, but the specific command used to disable Defender is more often seen in attacks.\n\nMy confidence level is around 0.8 because while there are red flags, there's still some ambiguity without additional context like timestamps or known patterns of normal activity on this system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows attempts to disable Windows Defender using Dism.exe and multiple file accesses in a temporary directory, potentially indicating malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, all the events are related to processes starting with 'dism.exe' and 'dismhost.exe'. These executables are part of the Windows Deployment Services, which are used for tasks like deploying and maintaining Windows images. They're legitimate tools for system administrators, so their execution alone isn't necessarily suspicious.\n\nNext, I notice multiple entries where 'File Executable Detected' is logged. This rule usually flags when an executable file is created or modified, but in this case, it's just part of the normal operation of dism.exe and dismhost.exe. They generate these events as they load various DLL files needed for their operations.\n\nLooking at the file paths, all the files are located under a temporary directory path: 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\[some GUID]\\...'. Temporary directories are common places where applications store temporary files, and it's normal for legitimate software to create and access these. The specific DLLs like ProvProvider.dll, SetupPlatformProvider.dll, etc., seem to be standard components used by dismhost.exe.\n\nThere's a process creation event for 'dismhost.exe' with a command line argument that looks like a GUID: '{3ED660F2-D9DD-43D4-B3AD-3464234FFF3A}'. This is typical when starting such processes, as GUIDs are often used to identify specific instances or configurations.\n\nAnother point is the repeated 'Image loaded' events. These indicate that various DLL files are being loaded into memory by dismhost.exe, which again is expected behavior for a running process that relies on these modules.\n\nI should also consider whether these activities could be part of malicious behavior. Since all the processes and file operations align with known legitimate functions of the Windows Deployment Tools, there's no obvious sign of malicious activity here. If this were an attack, I'd expect to see anomalies like unexpected paths, attempts to access restricted areas, or unusual network connections, which aren't present.\n\nAdditionally, the uniformity in the events suggests a routine operation rather than varied activities from different sources, which would be more concerning. The consistent use of temp files and known system processes further supports this.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to monitor such operations, especially if they're happening outside normal working hours or in an environment where such tools aren't typically used, the events as described don't indicate malicious behavior.

Let's break down what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, all the events mention \"process\" as either 'DismHost.exe' or later 'Dism.exe'. The tasks involve loading images (ImageLoad) and deleting files (FileDeleteDetected). The file paths are similar across multiple entries but end with different .dll filenames. \n\nI notice that DismHost.exe is loading several DLLs into memory, which seems normal if it's part of a legitimate process like system setup or maintenance. However, the fact that all these DLLs are being deleted by another process, Dism.exe, raises some flags. The path where these files are stored (AppData\\Local\\Temp) is common for temporary files, so it could be expected behavior from a cleanup routine.\n\nBut why would multiple .dll files be loaded and then immediately deleted? It might be part of a legitimate process like system updates or patches being applied and cleaned up afterward. Alternatively, it could indicate that malicious software is dropping these DLLs temporarily before deleting them to avoid detection.\n\nThe repetition of the same temporary folder suggests a controlled environment where perhaps an installer or update package is extracting multiple components and then removing them after installation. However, without knowing the exact purpose of Dism.exe on this system, it's hard to be certain if this behavior is normal.\n\nI'm considering confidence levels: If these actions are part of standard Windows operations (like during a deployment or update), then it's not malicious, so confidence in being non-interesting would be high. But if the presence of multiple DLLs with similar naming conventions and their deletion shortly after loading seems unusual for this system, it might indicate suspicious activity.\n\nGiven that DismHost.exe is known to be related to Windows deployment services, it's plausible that these events are part of a legitimate process, especially since all the files are under a temporary directory. Therefore, while there's some uncertainty, the most likely scenario is that this isn't malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows normal system processes related to loading and cleaning up temporary DLL files during Windows deployment or update operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

It's not something malicious per se, but I need to see what it's doing.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, most of them are \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\" and one is \"File creation time changed (rule: FileCreateTime)\". So Dism.exe is either deleting files or changing their creation times. The file paths all point to temporary folders under C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp, which suggests it's dealing with temporary files.\n\nThe specific files being deleted are various DLLs and MUI files in different language subfolders (like en-US). These seem like standard components used by Windows for deployment or servicing. Dism.exe is known to handle these kinds of operations during setup or updates.\n\nNow, considering if this activity is suspicious: Since all events involve a legitimate process deleting its own temporary files or adjusting their metadata, it doesn't raise red flags. There's no indication of unauthorized access or unusual behavior beyond what Dism.exe typically does.\n\nI'm also thinking about the confidence level. While I can't be 100% certain without more context, given that all events are from a known process handling temporary files, it seems low risk.

Each line starts with \"process\":\"{'name': 'Dism.exe'}\", which tells me that Dism.exe is the process involved. The \"winlog\" field indicates that there's a task related to file deletion being logged under the rule FileDeleteDetected. So every event is about Dism.exe deleting a file.\n\nNow, I should analyze what these files are and why their deletion might be significant. The file paths all point to various .dll.mui files located in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder. The filenames vary, but they include things like IBSProvider.dll.mui, ImagingProvider.dll.mui, and others.\n\nI know that Dism.exe is related to Windows Deployment Services. It's used for deploying Windows images and can perform tasks like servicing, capturing, and configuring images. When working with these images, it's common for temporary files to be created and then deleted once they're no longer needed. So, deleting a bunch of .dll.mui files might just be part of the normal process when Dism.exe is working on an image.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether this activity is outside the usual patterns. Since all events are identical except for the specific file paths, it seems repetitive and consistent with legitimate operations during image processing. If there were variations in processes or unusual files being deleted, that might raise a red flag, but here everything looks uniform and related to Dism.exe's known functions.\n\nBut wait, why are so many files being deleted? Could this be part of an automated process that runs periodically? It's possible that this is just a batch cleanup after some deployment task. The fact that all events come from the same process and target temporary directories makes me lean towards it being normal.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether these .dll.mui files are system-related or could be malicious in nature. Since they're located in a temp folder under AppData, they might have been extracted during some operation and are now being cleaned up. Malware often creates temp files, but in this case, the process is Dism.exe, which isn't typically associated with malicious activities.\n\nAnother angle to consider is if multiple deletions in quick succession could indicate something suspicious. But without knowing the exact timing between these events or seeing other related logs (like file creation or access times), it's hard to say definitively. Since all the events are similar and come from a known legitimate process, the risk of them being malicious seems low.\n\nI should also check if Dism.exe is commonly used in attacks. From what I know, it's not typically targeted by attackers because its primary function is related to system deployment rather than user-level operations. Attackers usually go after more common processes or services with broader access rights.\n\nIn conclusion, while the batch of events does involve file deletions which can sometimes be indicative of malicious activity, in this case, the consistency with legitimate Dism.exe operations and the nature of the files being deleted suggest that these events are not unusual. There's no evidence here pointing to unauthorized or malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate file deletions by Dism.exe during normal system operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the logs, each line has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always Dism.exe, which stands for Deployment Image Service Installer. That's a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing operating systems, like installing updates or performing other system changes. So, it's not inherently malicious.\n\nThe winlog field in each event mentions \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\". This indicates that a file was deleted and this action is being logged by the system's file deletion detection rule. It doesn't specify whether it's suspicious or not—it just reports a deletion event.\n\nThe file paths are all located under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp followed by different DLLs: FfuProvider.dll, FolderProvider.dll, etc. These seem to be temporary files created during the execution of Dism.exe. Since Dism is used for system deployment and servicing, it's common for it to create and delete temporary files in such locations.\n\nNow, considering all 14 events together: they're all from the same process, deleting various DLLs from a temp directory. This seems like part of a normal operation where Dism.exe is cleaning up after itself or as part of its servicing routine. There's no indication of unusual behavior here—no multiple failed attempts, deletions of system files, or access to restricted areas.\n\nSince all events are consistent with expected activity from a legitimate Windows process and there's nothing out of the ordinary in terms of timing or frequency, this batch doesn't raise any red flags for malicious activity. Therefore, I would classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it likely represents normal system operations rather than anything suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletion events by Dism.exe in a temporary directory are indicative of legitimate Windows servicing activities and do not suggest malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and decide if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at the command lines in the process field, I see a lot of PowerShell executions with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. That usually isn't suspicious on its own since PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks. But let me check what commands are being run.\n\nIn the first few events, the command is just writing \"Final result: 1\" to the host. That doesn't seem malicious; it's a simple output. However, later in the batch, there's a more complex command. It initializes $Res to 0 and then looks through files in the Windows INF directory for specific patterns.\n\nThe script checks each .inf file in %WinDir%\\inf and looks for lines matching \"\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\]\". If it finds such a line, $Res becomes 1 and breaks out of the loop. Then it writes \"Final result:\" followed by $Res.\n\nWhy would this be done? It might be related to checking for specific device drivers or system components. Malware often checks for certain installed software or configurations before executing further actions. This could indicate a pre-execution check, possibly to avoid detection or to ensure the environment is suitable for malicious activities.\n\nThe fact that multiple events are repeating the same command suggests an automated process running several times. If this were part of a larger attack, seeing repeated checks might be normal, but on its own, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the WinLog task field, most events are labeled as \"Provider Lifecycle\" and one as \"Engine Lifecycle\". I'm not entirely sure what these tasks signify in terms of system logs. If they're standard for certain operations, then maybe nothing unusual here.\n\nI also notice that there are no file accesses reported beyond the script itself. No writes or reads to other files outside the .inf directory, so perhaps it's a limited operation. But again, depending on the context, checking INF files could be part of legitimate system checks or reconnaissance.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell scripts running in Restricted mode, which is unusual because usually, attackers would use Bypass policies. They're querying specific INF patterns, possibly to identify the architecture or components present. The repetition might indicate testing across different systems or time-based execution.\n\nWhile isolated instances of this script might not be suspicious, seeing several could raise flags if they don't correlate with known legitimate activities. However, without more context on the environment and user behavior, it's hard to definitively say it's malicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of repeated PowerShell commands accessing specific system files might indicate an attack vector or data gathering phase.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing in Restricted mode, querying specific patterns in system INF files may indicate potential malicious activity such as system reconnaissance or pre-attack checks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are four events in total, each with a JSON structure containing process, winlog, and file information.\n\nStarting with the first event:\n- The process field shows powershell.exe being executed with some command-line arguments. It looks like it's trying to access certain files in the Windows directory and checking for specific patterns in those files. This could be suspicious because PowerShell is often used by attackers for malicious activities.\n  \nSecond event:\n- Here, the process is None, and the winlog task is 'Security Group Management'. Not immediately alarming, but I should keep it in mind when considering the whole batch.\n\nThird event:\n- The process is services.exe, which is a legitimate Windows process. It's associated with the Logon task. Nothing unusual here; services.exe handles service-related tasks during user logons.\n\nFourth event:\n- Process is None again, and the winlog task is 'Special Logon'. This might be part of normal system operations, possibly related to background processes or services starting up.\n\nNow, considering all events together, the first one stands out because it's using PowerShell with specific commands. The command tries to look for INF files in the Windows directory and checks if they match certain patterns related to installation sections. This kind of activity could be part of legitimate system administration tasks, but it might also indicate an attempt to gather information or modify system settings maliciously.\n\nThe other events don't add much in terms of concern on their own, but when combined with the first event, they don't provide enough context to rule out suspicious behavior. There's no indication of any failures or errors that would make this activity more concerning, but the mere fact that a script is parsing system files could be a red flag.\n\nI'm moderately confident that this batch is interesting because it involves potential unauthorized access or file inspection using PowerShell, which is a common tool for attackers. However, without additional context like timestamps, user information, or other events showing unusual behavior, it's hard to say with certainty if it's malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains an event where PowerShell is used with specific command-line arguments that could indicate potential malicious activity, such as checking for installation patterns in system files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this data that was provided. It seems like a series of logs or events captured from some system, possibly related to cybersecurity since there are mentions of processes and file paths. The user included both JSON-like structures and some text blocks, but it's a bit hard to parse exactly what each part means.\n\nFirst, I notice there are entries with \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" keys. For example, the first entry has a complex string under \"process\" that looks like a command line or perhaps an event ID in some encoded format. The \"winlog\" key mentions tasks like \"Process Create\" and \"Registry value set,\" which are typical Windows events related to system processes and registry changes.\n\nThere's also an entry where the process is \"svchost.exe\", which is a common Windows process that can host various services, so it's not inherently malicious but could be used for malicious purposes. Then there are multiple entries showing PowerShell commands being executed, specifically creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and starting it. This caught my attention because PowerShell is often used in cybersecurity both for legitimate administration tasks and for executing malicious scripts.\n\nLooking at the command lines, they're using New-Service to create a service pointing to \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". I'm wondering if this path is standard or if it's a custom location. If it's a legitimate system folder, maybe it's okay, but if it's an unusual directory, especially one that wasn't previously known, it could be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the repeated use of these PowerShell commands multiple times in different entries. It might indicate an attempt to ensure the service is created and started successfully, or perhaps it's part of a script that's looping until it succeeds. Either way, repetitive attempts can sometimes be a sign of something more nefarious, like persistence mechanisms where malware tries to keep itself running.\n\nThere are also entries where the process command line is just \"powershell.exe\" with some parameters, including an execution policy set to Restricted and a simple Write-Host command. This seems less concerning on its own but could be part of a larger script or payload delivery method.\n\nI'm trying to piece together the narrative from these logs. It looks like someone or something is using PowerShell to create and start a new service on the system. The fact that it's done multiple times might mean there were failed attempts, or maybe it's a way to ensure persistence across reboots by ensuring the service starts automatically.\n\nI'm also thinking about how this could relate to cybersecurity threats. Creating services with custom binaries can be a method used by malware to maintain persistence. If \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is a new or unknown file, it might contain malicious code that runs at startup via the service. Alternatively, if this is part of an automated script for system administration, it could just be legitimate.\n\nI should consider the context in which these logs were generated. Are they from a corporate network where such changes are monitored and controlled? Or are they from a personal device with less restrictions? Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but some red flags include the use of PowerShell for service creation, the specific file path, and the repeated attempts.\n\nI'm also wondering about the timestamps of these events. If they're all within a short period, that could indicate a concerted effort by an attacker trying to establish persistence. On the other hand, if spread out over time, it might be part of regular maintenance scripts.\n\nAnother angle is the file path \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\". This translates roughly to \"Common Logical Unit\" and \"Common Registration Entry Base,\" which doesn't ring any bells as a standard Windows directory. It seems more like a custom or user-defined folder, making it suspicious if such directories are being used for system services.\n\nIn summary, while I'm not an expert in interpreting these logs, the repeated use of PowerShell to create and start a service with a non-standard file path raises some red flags. It's worth investigating whether \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is associated with known malicious activity, checking the source of these commands (user-initiated or script-driven), and ensuring that such services are authorized and not part of a larger attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided logs, here is an organized summary:\n\n1. **Event Types**: The logs include process creation events, registry modifications, and PowerShell command executions.\n\n2. **Suspicious Activities**:\n   - **PowerShell Usage**: Multiple entries show the use of PowerShell to execute commands, particularly creating and starting a service named \"objeto_ativo\". This is concerning because PowerShell is often used in cyberattacks.\n   - **Repeated Commands**: The same PowerShell commands are executed multiple times, which might indicate failed attempts or persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **File Path Concerns**: The file path \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\" appears non-standard, raising suspicions as it may be a custom location used for malicious purposes.\n\n4. **Service Creation**: The creation of the service \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to an unusual binary might be part of establishing persistence on the system.\n\n5. **Potential Malicious Indicators**:\n   - The repeated and successful execution of these commands could indicate an attempt to maintain control over the system.\n   - The file \"tarefa_logico.exe\" in the specified path should be investigated for malicious content.\n\n6. **Recommendations**:\n   - Check if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is associated with known malware.\n   - Verify if the service creation is authorized or part of legitimate system operations.\n   - Review the source of these commands to determine if they are user-initiated or from an external script.\n\nIn conclusion, while not definitive proof of malicious activity, the patterns observed suggest potential security concerns that warrant further investigation."}
