{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break down each event and see the bigger picture.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is chrome.exe with a Registry value set task. Chrome is a common browser, so it's not unusual for it to interact with the registry. But seeing this repeated six times in a row might be worth noting. However, considering it's just registry writes by a legitimate process, it's probably not malicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are two powershell.exe entries where the task is ProcessAccess. PowerShell is commonly used for both benign and malicious activities, so any access event could indicate something suspicious. But in this case, without more context like specific commands or file accesses, it's hard to say if this is part of normal admin tasks or potential exploitation.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process creation. Whoami is often used by attackers to gather information about the current user. The fact that it's executed with no additional command-line arguments raises some flags. It might be a reconnaissance step in an attack chain, but without seeing other related events like credential dumping or lateral movement, it's hard to confirm.\n\nLooking at all events together: six chrome.exe registry writes, two powershell accesses, and one whoami creation. Individually, each event isn't necessarily alarming, but the combination could hint at some malicious activity. The repetition of chrome.exe might be part of a broader campaign trying to stay under the radar by using common processes.\n\nConsidering confidence levels: It's not high because there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior beyond these events. However, the presence of whoami and powershell accesses, which are often used in attacks, combined with repeated registry writes from chrome.exe, does raise some concerns. So I'd classify this batch as interesting but with a moderate confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of chrome.exe writing to the registry and powershell.exe accessing processes, along with whoami.exe being executed could indicate potential malicious activity or investigation-worthy behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is 'svchost.exe' performing a Registry value set task. I know svchost.exe is a common Windows process that hosts services, but it can also be used maliciously. However, seeing it perform registry changes isn't immediately suspicious unless combined with other actions.\n\nThen, another event shows 'svchost.exe' creating a file in the Tasks directory: C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup. That's unusual because svchost typically doesn't create files there. It could be setting up a scheduled task, but I should keep an eye on that.\n\nNext, 'cmd.exe' and 'conhost.exe' are also performing Registry value sets. Both can be legitimate for various tasks, but again, in the context of multiple such events, it's something to note.\n\nMoving on, there are several instances where 'powershell.exe' is involved. One event shows a registry change, another creates a file named unidade_ativo.txt in the user's Downloads folder. Powershell can be used maliciously for scripting, so creating files could be part of an attack chain, like downloading or executing scripts.\n\nThe 'chrome.exe' process has multiple Registry value sets and image loads. Chrome loading DLLs isn't unusual, but the specific paths, especially amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, are interesting. These are related to antivirus and anti-malware scanning. If Chrome is interacting with these, it might be trying to bypass security measures, which raises a red flag.\n\nLooking at 'winlogbeat.exe', I see it's creating a new configuration file in its data directory. That seems normal if winlogbeat is running and updating its config, but since it's part of the logs being analyzed, it could be an artifact of log collection rather than malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes (svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe) making registry changes. Powershell creating a file in Downloads might be downloading something. Chrome loading antivirus DLLs and accessing the registry are concerning because such actions can indicate attempts to disable security features or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe high number of RegistryEvent tasks across different processes suggests potential unauthorized configuration changes. Additionally, the creation of files by svchost.exe and powershell.exe could be part of installing malware components or creating backdoors. These activities together create a pattern that deviates from normal user behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes (svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe) are performing registry modifications and file creations, including the creation of potentially suspicious files like 'unidade_ativo.txt' by powershell.exe. Additionally, chrome.exe is loading antivirus-related DLLs, which may indicate attempts to bypass security measures.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the events are from processes like chrome.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, and others. The tasks mentioned include things like Dns query, Network connection detected, Registry value set, Process access, Image load, etc.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, chrome.exe is doing some network connections and DNS queries. That's normal for a browser since it needs to connect to websites and resolve domain names. So nothing suspicious there yet.\n\nThen I see notepad.exe accessing the registry. Notepad is a simple text editor; accessing the registry seems a bit out of place but not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nNext, powershell.exe is showing up multiple times with ProcessAccess tasks. Powershell is often used for legitimate system administration tasks, but it's also commonly exploited by attackers. Multiple process access events could be concerning, but I need more context.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe are both related to the Windows services. They accessing the registry might be normal, but repeated instances could indicate something fishy, especially since svchost is often used by malware to hide their processes.\n\nThen there's calc.exe being executed through cmd.exe as part of a scheduled task via schtasks. That seems odd because why would someone schedule a calculator to run on startup or logon? It doesn't make much sense unless it's trying to do something else in the background, like using the calculator's execution as a way to run other commands.\n\nLooking closer at the command lines, especially for cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, I see that they're creating tasks that execute calc.exe. This is concerning because legitimate use of such tools for scheduling benign processes like calculators is rare. It might be an attempt to create persistence points or to hide malicious activities behind a harmless-looking process.\n\nAlso, the multiple instances where svchost.exe is creating files and modifying registry entries could indicate the installation of persistent malware components. The fact that these events are repeated suggests some kind of automated or batch activity, which raises suspicion.\n\nPutting it all together: there's a pattern here with multiple processes accessing the registry, creating scheduled tasks via schtasks.exe to run calc.exe, and powershell being used. These activities don't align with normal user behavior and could indicate attempts at persistence, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within a network. The repeated use of schtasks.exe to create startup tasks is particularly tellingâ€”it's a common technique in malware for ensuring that malicious processes start on boot or logon.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the combination of registry modifications, process creation with suspicious command lines, and scheduled tasks executing calc.exe points toward potential malicious activity. The confidence level isn't 100%, but there are enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity, including suspicious process creations and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
