I'm seeing multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal since Chrome is a browser that handles a lot of network traffic.\n\nThen there are several events involving powershell.exe. The first few are process access events, which could be legitimate but also can be signs of malicious activity. There's a command line in one event showing some encoded PowerShell code. Looking closer, it's XOR-ing plaintext with a key. This encoding technique is often used to obfuscate malicious scripts to avoid detection.\n\nThe script being created and then deleted is suspicious too. Creating temporary files and immediately deleting them can be a tactic to cover tracks. The file paths in the events are pointing to legitimate system files when images are loaded, but combined with the other activities, it raises red flags.\n\nOverall, the combination of using powershell.exe for multiple actions, including obfuscation, creating\/deleting temp files, and accessing registry values, suggests potential malicious behavior.

Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the format is JSONL, which means each line is a separate JSON object. There are seven events in total.\n\nThe first event has \"process\" as powershell.exe and the winlog task is about a pipe being created. That's normal because PowerShell often creates pipes for communication between processes.\n\nBut looking at the subsequent events, the process command lines are all the same. They're executing a PowerShell script that encodes some text using XOR cipher with a key, then sends it via HTTP POST to example.com. This is concerning because it looks like data exfiltration—the script is encoding potentially sensitive information (like a file path) and sending it out.\n\nThe fact that this command line appears multiple times suggests an automated or batch process running the same malicious script repeatedly. The repeated attempts could be part of an ongoing attack, trying to send data without being detected.\n\nThere's also the use of a basic XOR cipher. While not very sophisticated, it still indicates an attempt to hide the plaintext data. This kind of encoding is common in scripts meant to bypass simple monitoring or logging systems.\n\nThe URI example.com seems suspicious because it's a generic domain and could be controlled by malicious actors. There's no indication that this is a legitimate service, so sending POST requests there raises red flags about data exfiltration.\n\nConsidering all these points together: repeated attempts from powershell.exe to send encoded data via HTTP POST to an external domain indicates potential malicious activity. This combination of events isn't just a single incident but part of a pattern that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing XOR-based encoding and sending data to an external URI indicate potential data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from various processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and several chrome.exe instances all performing Registry value sets. This seems a bit unusual because common applications typically don't modify the registry that often, especially in such a short period. It could indicate some form of persistence or configuration changes by malicious software.\n\nNext, I notice powershell.exe appearing multiple times with different tasks: ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious activities like command execution or file operations. The fact that it's accessing processes and modifying registry values raises a red flag. Additionally, there's a command line in one of the powershell.exe events that tries to remove a specific batch file. This deletion attempt could be an attempt to cover tracks by removing potential evidence.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. While this tool is often used benignly to check user information, its execution could also be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation in a more malicious context.\n\nAnother point is the winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is usually a legitimate tool for log management, but sometimes attackers use it as a payload delivery vector, so I should keep that in mind.\n\nLooking at all these together, the repeated Registry modifications across different processes and multiple powershell.exe activities with suspicious command lines strongly suggest potential malicious behavior. The attempt to delete files could be an indicator of data exfiltration or destruction, which are hallmarks of cyberattacks. The combination of these events isn't typical for normal system operations and could indicate a coordinated attack.\n\nI'm also considering the confidence level here. While some of these actions can be legitimate, the frequency and the specific tasks (like registry modifications and powershell script execution) make me lean towards this being malicious activity. So my confidence is high that this batch is worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes show suspicious activities, including repeated Registry modifications by various executables and unusual PowerShell actions, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event has powershell.exe executing some code. The command line shows it encoding plaintext with XOR using a key, then sending the ciphertext via POST to example.com. That seems suspicious because powershell is often used for malicious activities, and XOR encoding isn't very strong. It might be trying to hide data being sent out.\n\nThe next few events are about loading images or files. Powershell loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender sounds normal since it's part of legitimate processes. Similarly, winlogbeat.exe creating a new config file is probably just the tool doing its thing.\n\nThen there's another powershell event with similar command line as the first one. It seems like the same script is running again, which might indicate persistence or multiple attempts to send data. That repetition could be a sign of malicious activity trying to send data repeatedly.\n\nLooking at other events, I see powershell accessing registry values and file operations. The fact that it's accessing the registry suggests possible changes to system configurations, which can be part of malicious behavior like creating persistent keys or altering settings for persistence.\n\nOther processes like conhost.exe and svchost.exe also have registry activity. While these are common processes, their interaction with the registry could indicate something if they're making unexpected changes. Notepad and calc.exe loading urlmon.dll might be normal, but it's worth noting that some malware can inject into legitimate processes.\n\nThere's a DNS query event too, which is part of any network activity. If the previous powershell script sent data to example.com, this could be related, possibly indicating command and control communication.\n\nConsidering all these together: repeated powershell executions with XOR encoding sending data, registry modifications by multiple processes, including known malicious ones like powershell. These activities raise red flags because they can be indicators of an attack—like data exfiltration or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm not seeing any clear benign explanations for all this.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with commands like Remove-Item. These are deleting files in specific paths. That could be suspicious because deleting files can indicate someone trying to cover their tracks or remove malicious files.\n\nThen there are several events where other executables like cmd.exe and whoami.exe are used. For example, one event shows cmd.exe stopping and deleting services related to \"objeto_temporario\" and \"estrutura_secundario\". This suggests someone is managing system services, which might be part of a malicious activity.\n\nThere are also registry events where values are being set or objects added\/deleted. These actions can be used by malware to maintain persistence or alter system configurations, which raises red flags.\n\nLooking at the processes created: PowerShell, cmd.exe, whoami.exe, and conhost.exe are all appearing multiple times. The repeated use of these tools might indicate an attacker using them for different tasks, possibly including moving laterally or executing commands.\n\nThe combination of deleting files, managing services, and modifying registry entries across several processes is concerning.

My job is to figure out if this entire batch should be classified as interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nLet me go through each event one by one and see what's happening here.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the events are from powershell.exe. That's not necessarily bad on its own because PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks. But sometimes it's also used in malicious activities. Let me check what each event says.\n\nThe first few events show ImageLoad tasks by powershell.exe, loading various .dll files like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. These are known to be part of the .NET framework, which is standard on Windows systems. So that might not raise any red flags yet.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe creates a file in the Downloads folder called estrutura_temporario.txt. Creating a file isn't unusual, but I should consider if this file is suspicious or used for malicious purposes later.\n\nNext, multiple events are from chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome often modifies the registry for updates or settings, so that's probably normal unless it's doing something unexpected. Since there's no indication of any other issues with these events, I don't think they're concerning on their own.\n\nThen, another set of ImageLoad tasks by powershell.exe loading more .NET files and MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Defender's components are legitimate, so that seems okay.\n\nNow, the next few events are interesting. Powershell.exe creates a file in the Temp folder: __PSScriptPolicyTest_hngxvv3x.rso.ps1. Then immediately deletes it. Creating and deleting temporary files is common for scripts to avoid detection, but doing this with PowerShell could be a sign of something malicious trying to test if script execution policies are enforced.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe is running Remove-Item commands via command_line parameters. Each one is targeting specific .bat files in different paths and removing them. Deleting files isn't inherently bad, but the fact that it's deleting multiple batch scripts across various directories could be concerning. Batch scripts can contain malicious commands, so an automated deletion of many such files might be part of a cleanup routine after executing them.\n\nPutting this all together: The repeated use of powershell.exe to load .NET libraries (possibly for obfuscation), creating and immediately deleting a PowerShell script in Temp, and systematically deleting multiple batch files could indicate suspicious activity. These actions are often seen in attempts to hide malicious scripts or erase evidence after executing them.\n\nWhile not conclusive on their own, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior. The confidence level is around 0.7 because while some activities might be benign, others point towards possible threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe loading .NET libraries, creating and deleting temporary files, and systematically removing several batch files suggest potential malicious activity.

That's a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The repeated access might indicate someone trying different commands or perhaps testing the environment.\n\nThen there are several instances of cmd.exe executing commands like deleting files in the temp directory. While using cmd to delete files isn't inherently suspicious, the fact that it's combined with other activities involving PowerShell makes me cautious. Maybe the user is trying to cover their tracks by cleaning up logs or files?\n\nI also see a whoami.exe process running. That could be used to check user permissions or privileges, which might be part of an attacker's lateral movement within the system. It's a common tool for reconnaissance.\n\nLooking at the file events, PowerShell created and then immediately deleted a script in the temp directory. This behavior is red flags because attackers often create temporary scripts to execute malicious code without leaving a long trace. The quick creation and deletion could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nThe image loading events show various DLLs being loaded by PowerShell.exe. Some of these are part of .NET framework, which is normal, but others likeclrjit.dll or MpOAV.dll might indicate specific behaviors. It's possible that the script is using these libraries for something malicious, though it's hard to be certain without more context.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple process creations, file manipulations, registry changes, and temporary script deletions—especially from known tools like PowerShell and cmd.exe—raise suspicion. These activities could be part of a larger attack campaign, such as deploying malware or conducting reconnaissance.

I'm trying to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, each line is an event with process info, winlog task, and file details. There are multiple entries, so I'll need to analyze them as a whole.\n\nLooking through the events:\n\n1. The first event involves `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file, which seems normal since it's likely related to log management.\n2. Next, several events mention `powershell.exe`, including some with command lines like `'& {}'`. Repeated provider and engine lifecycle tasks might indicate script execution or setup steps in PowerShell, but the exact commands are unclear here. The file paths for MpClient.dll and StartupProfileData seem legitimate, but it's worth noting that PowerShell is often used maliciously.\n3. There's a process where `whoami.exe` is created, which could be used to gather system information—something an attacker might do for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n4. Notably, there's a command line with `cmd.exe` deleting a file in the Temp directory: `del \/f \/q \/s %TEMP%\\modulo_base.exe`. The use of del and redirection to nul is common in scripts but could be malicious if combined with other activities. Also, deleting files from the Temp folder isn't inherently bad, but it might indicate an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after some action.\n5. There are multiple registry events across different processes. While modifying the registry can be part of legitimate operations, too many changes without a clear purpose could be suspicious.\n\nPutting this together: There's a mix of normal and potentially concerning activities. The repeated use of PowerShell with unclear command lines might raise eyebrows. The deletion of a file in Temp, especially if it's done by cmd.exe following other actions, could indicate malicious behavior or an attempt to clean up traces. The whoami.exe usage is another red flag as it can be used for reconnaissance.\n\nHowever, without more context, some of these actions could also be part of routine system operations.

Maybe trying to cover tracks.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs and creating files. The repeated FileCreate and RegistryEvent tasks stand out—this kind of activity could be part of malicious scripts trying to create or modify system settings.\n\nI notice another process called conhost.exe also accessing the registry. That's unusual because conhost is typically for console windows, not usually involved in such activities.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe running without any arguments. While whoami can be innocent, it's often used by attackers to check permissions or user context. Combined with PowerShell activity, this raises flags.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe is accessing other processes and registry values. This could indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement within the system.\n\nA few FileDeleteDetected events for a script file suggest that something was created and then quickly deleted, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nLastly, there's a Pipe Created event by PowerShell, which can be used for communication between different processes—something attackers might use to hide their activities.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell with suspicious commands, deletions, registry modifications, and process access.

Let's go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is 'powershell.exe' with different command lines. Some have an empty command line, which might be a bit odd but could just mean it's being called without arguments. Others mention tasks like Provider Lifecycle or Engine Lifecycle, which I think are normal for PowerShell starting up. Then there are events showing files being accessed, like MpClient.dll and some profile data folders. These don't seem suspicious on their own.\n\nNext, I notice a few 'whoami.exe' processes being created. 'Whoami' is a common tool to check user information, so that's not alarming unless it's used maliciously here. But I don't see any command-line arguments that would indicate misuse, like accessing remote systems or fetching data.\n\nThere are also some events involving 'conhost.exe', which is just the Windows Console Host, and another one about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. These seem related to log collection tools and system processes, so they're probably benign.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these logs are normal system activities: starting PowerShell, loading necessary files, and standard user info checks with whoami. There's no indication of unusual behavior like failed login attempts, access to restricted areas, or execution of malicious scripts. Since each event individually isn't suspicious, and there's no pattern suggesting coordinated malicious activity across the batch, I'd classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING\".

Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. That's interesting because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and also for malicious activities, especially in attacks like phishing or malware execution.\n\nThe first event shows that a process accessed something with the rule ProcessAccess. Then there's a file being created in the user's Downloads folder named tarefa_comum.txt. Creating files directly in user directories could be suspicious if it's unexpected.\n\nNext, I see multiple events where PowerShell is executing commands to remove a log file from the TEMP directory. The command Remove-Item is used here, which deletes the file without confirmation. Also, using -ErrorAction Ignore means any errors during deletion won't be shown, which might indicate an attempt to hide failed operations.\n\nI notice several instances of Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events. These are typically related to how PowerShell interacts with other system components, but repeated occurrences can sometimes signal script activity or module loading, which might not be malicious on their own but could be part of a larger script execution.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created in the Temp folder with a specific name, __PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1. This looks like a PowerShell script test file. The fact that it's created and then immediately deleted suggests that something might be trying to bypass certain policy checks or testing script execution policies.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe with the same command line is concerning. It could indicate automated activity or part of a larger script run multiple times, which might be normal in some cases but raises flags when combined with other actions like file deletions and registry modifications.\n\nLooking at the Registry value set events, these could be related to persistence mechanisms, where malicious actors write to the Registry to maintain access across reboots. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nThe Image loaded events show various DLLs being loaded by PowerShell.exe. Some of these are legitimate system files and .NET framework components, which is normal. But others might be related to specific modules or could indicate that certain functions are being called within the script.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a lot of activity from PowerShell.exe executing scripts, creating and deleting files, accessing registry keys, and loading various libraries. While some actions can be benign, especially if this is part of normal system administration tasks, others like the repeated deletion attempts, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and script testing could indicate malicious behavior or at least unusual activity that warrants closer investigation.\n\nI'm also noting that there are multiple events with similar command lines, which might suggest a loop or automated process. The use of -ErrorAction Ignore is another red flag because it's commonly used to suppress errors when deleting files that might not exist, preventing logging of such actions.\n\nGiven all these points, the batch seems to be indicative of potentially malicious activity.

Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nThe first four events all involve powershell.exe being accessed via the ProcessAccess rule. Powershell is a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously, so repeated access might be suspicious. However, without more context on what exactly powershell is doing, it's hard to tell if this activity is normal or not.\n\nNext, there are instances where whoami.exe is being executed. This is usually harmless as it just returns user information. But since it's appearing a few times, I wonder if it's part of some script or automated process. Still, on its own, it's not a big red flag unless used in conjunction with other tools.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe writes to the registry. Registry modifications can be tricky because they're often used by malware to persistence. Powershell is known for being able to do this quietly, so this particular event raises my attention. I should note that malicious actors might use such techniques to ensure their code runs at startup.\n\nLooking further, there's a file creation event by winlogbeat.exe. This seems like it could be part of a log monitoring tool, which is normal if winlogbeat is installed legitimately. However, without knowing the exact purpose and permissions of this process, I'm cautious because sometimes attackers use such tools for lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nAnother powershell access event comes up again. The repetition makes me think about whether these accesses are part of a legitimate admin task or if they're spread out over time in an attempt to avoid detection. If it's the latter, that would be more concerning.\n\nI also see another whoami.exe execution. It reinforces the previous point but still doesn't add enough concern on its own. The key here is whether these processes are part of a larger pattern or isolated incidents.\n\nIn total, the batch has multiple powershell accesses and some registry activity, which together might indicate suspicious behavior. However, there's no clear evidence of malicious intent just yet—like failed login attempts, access to sensitive files, or network traffic anomalies. \n\nOn the other hand, having several process creations and file writes without corresponding success indicators could be a sign of reconnaissance or lateral movement within the network. The combination of powershell (often used for attacks) and registry changes is particularly notable because such actions are common in attack chains.\n\nConsidering all these points, while there's no smoking gun, the patterns suggest potential malicious activity. The confidence level isn't very high without more context, but it's enough to warrant closer examination. Therefore, I classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
