I see multiple events involving PowerShell executing Compress-Archive commands across different paths. This could indicate data being packaged and possibly exfiltrated.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' tasks, many are related to provider and engine lifecycles, which are typical for PowerShell scripts running. However, the combination of several compress-archive calls, especially from different modules or locations, might suggest a pattern. The repeated use of $env:TEMP for destination paths is a red flag because adversaries often use temp files to hide malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where 'winlogbeat.exe' creates a file in the user's Downloads directory. This could be unrelated unless it's part of a larger pattern. The Registry value sets and file creations by various processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe don't seem suspicious on their own but might warrant closer look if they correlate with other events.\n\nConsidering all these together, especially the multiple PowerShell commands compressing files to temp directories, there's a reasonable suspicion that this batch shows potential malicious activity. Therefore, I classify it as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Powershell.exe executing Compress-Archive commands across various paths suggest potential data packaging or exfiltration attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of PowerShell.exe processes being created and accessing various tasks. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate administration and malicious activities, so repeated instances might be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several calls to Compress-Archive in different events. Each time, it's compressing files from specific paths and saving them to temporary directories with names like modulo_temporario or elemento_logico. The use of -Force might indicate that these commands are overriding any existing files without prompting.\n\nThere's also file creation and deletion activity. A PowerShell script is created in the Temp directory and then immediately deleted. This could be an attempt to avoid detection by not leaving traces, but since it was logged, it's still noticeable.\n\nThe events show multiple instances of ImageLoad for various DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell scripts running. However, combined with the other activities, it might suggest something more malicious.\n\nI notice that some command lines are obfuscated or use different paths each time. This variability could be an attempt to evade pattern-based detection mechanisms.\n\nSince there are multiple events showing process creations and deletions of temporary files, along with compressing operations that might be part of a payload delivery, this batch raises concerns about potential malicious activity. The repeated and varied command-line arguments suggest automation or script execution, which is often used in attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe with varying command lines performing file compression and deletion, along with suspicious process creation events, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event one by one and see what they're telling me.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process name is 'svchost.exe' with tasks related to setting registry values. svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, often associated with services like svchost$ in the system32 directory. However, sometimes malicious actors can abuse it by creating sub-processes that mimic svchost.exe for lateral movement or persistence. The repeated registry writes could be suspicious if they're part of setting up something like a registry-based keylogger or modifying security settings.\n\nNext, I see 'Calculator.exe' being involved in loading image files. Calculator is a common tool but sometimes attackers can replace it with malicious versions. The file paths for urlmon.dll and amsi.dll don't immediately raise red flags since they are legitimate system components. However, if these modules are loaded by an unexpected process, it could indicate tampering or code injection.\n\nLooking at 'winlogbeat.exe', which is likely part of the ELK stack used for log management, it's creating files in a downloads directory. This seems normal unless it's accessing unusual locations or with elevated privileges. The paths mentioned look standard, so I'm not too concerned about this one yet.\n\nThen there are multiple entries from 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe' and repeated registry writes by various processes like 'chrome.exe'. Chrome is a common browser; however, seeing it perform registry modifications might be odd, especially if it's accessing parts of the registry that aren't typically touched by regular browsing activities. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks could indicate some form of persistence mechanism or configuration changes to avoid detection.\n\nNotably, there are entries from 'powershell.exe' performing both process access and creation events. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate scripting but also abused in attacks. ProcessAccess can be indicative of lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts. The whoami.exe execution with a command line that seems standard (checking user info) could be part of reconnaissance, which would definitely raise flags.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes are modifying the registry, some legitimate and some not so clear. The use of powershell.exe in different contexts, especially process access, is concerning. whoami.exe execution might be part of gathering system information for an attack. Additionally, Calculator and Chrome being involved in image loading could hint at potential code injection or malicious extensions.\n\nI'm also noticing that several processes are writing to the registry repeatedly, which could be a sign of establishing persistence or setting up malicious services. The combination of these activities across different executables makes me think there's a coordinated effort that might be malicious. While some events on their own aren't suspicious enough, together they form a pattern that needs investigation.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the cluster of registry writes, process access by PowerShell, and potential use of common tools for malicious purposes indicate possible attack behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes including svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe show repeated registry modifications and unusual activities indicative of potential malicious behavior. The use of whoami.exe adds to the suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
