{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through them one by one and see if I can spot anything unusual or concerning.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe creating a pipe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be abused for malicious activities. The next few entries are about images being loaded into memory, specifically MpOAV.dll and clrjit.dll. These seem like normal Windows components, so maybe not suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there's an event where Dism.exe is involved in file executable detection. I know that Dism is a legitimate tool for image servicing operations. But the files it's accessing are located in a temporary directory under a user profile. The paths look unusual with a long GUID-like folder name, which might be part of a malicious payload unpacking.\n\nLooking at all these Dism.exe events together, it seems like they're loading multiple DLLs andmui files from this temp directory. This could indicate that Dism is being exploited or misused to execute arbitrary code. Such behavior doesn't align with typical legitimate operations, especially when combined with the powershell activity earlier.\n\nI'm also considering whether these activities are part of a larger attack chain, like initial access, lateral movement, or persistence. The combination might be too extensive for normal system operations and could suggest some form of malicious script execution or payload deployment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, there's potential evidence of unauthorized or suspicious activity that merits further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple events involving powershell.exe and Dism.exe accessing files from a temporary directory with unusual naming.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event.\n\nFirst, I see multiple events where svchost.exe is creating files in different paths. Svchost is a legitimate Windows process, but it's often used by malware because it can execute code without being easily detected. The file paths like 'C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness' seem suspicious because they're accessing system directories, which might indicate an attempt to modify or inject malicious components.\n\nThen there are events from powershell.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. Looking at the command line in one of the events: it's running with -ExecutionPolicy Restricted, but the actual script is trying to read .inf files and check for specific patterns. This could be an attempt to detect or disable certain security features by looking for known signatures in those files.\n\nThe combination of these two processes—svchost.exe creating files and powershell.exe executing commands that might interfere with system configurations—is concerning. It suggests possible unauthorized access or manipulation. The repeated file creation events from svchost could be part of a persistence mechanism, while the PowerShell script might be trying to evade detection or modify system settings.\n\nI'm also noticing that some of these activities are happening in system directories and temporary files, which are common indicators of malicious behavior because attackers often target such locations to avoid user interaction and blend in with normal traffic.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, it's likely that this batch of logs indicates suspicious activity that could be worth investigating further. The justification is the combination of svchost.exe accessing system directories and powershell.exe running scripts that might interfere with system security.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe creating files in system directories, combined with PowerShell executing a script to check for specific patterns in .inf files.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at each event, most are from processes like svchost.exe and setup.exe performing tasks such as file creation, registry changes, and pipe creation. These actions themselves aren't necessarily malicious, but I should consider their frequency and context.\n\nI notice that setup.exe is creating several files in the Microsoft Edge directory, which seems legitimate if it's an update or installation. The svchost.exe entries modifying the registry could be normal too, since many system processes use svchost for various tasks.\n\nThe events don't show any unusual paths or suspicious activities like writing to unexpected locations or multiple failed attempts that might indicate brute force attacks. There are no anomalies in the file creation paths provided—they all point to standard directories for applications and temporary files.\n\nWhile there are a lot of registry modifications, without seeing specific keys being altered or evidence of persistence mechanisms, it's hard to flag this as malicious. The same goes for pipe creations; these can be part of normal inter-process communication.\n\nI should also consider the volume of events. There are 24 entries here, which might seem high, but given that they're from setup.exe and svchost.exe performing standard tasks during an installation or update process, it's plausible.\n\nNo signs of encryption, network connections, or other red flags typical in malicious activities. The user mentioned to analyze the entire batch as a whole, so I need to ensure there's no overarching pattern I'm missing, but each individual event seems benign.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, while some events might look suspicious on their own, the combination doesn't raise any red flags that would make this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes such as file creation and registry modifications by legitimate processes like setup.exe and svchost.exe, which are part of standard system operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I see several events from powershell.exe accessing and loading various image files. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously. The fact that it's loading different DLLs might indicate script execution or module loading, which could be suspicious. There are multiple instances of ImageLoad tasks for mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc., which are part of the .NET framework. While this is normal in some contexts, repeated loads might warrant attention.\n\nNext, there's a FileCreate event from powershell.exe creating a temporary file: __PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1. Temporary script files created by Powershell could be part of malicious scripts or testing policies. This is a red flag because attackers often use such files to execute code.\n\nThen, there's a Pipe Created event from powershell.exe. Pipes are used for inter-process communication; while legitimate, they can also be used in command-line attacks to hide commands. This adds some concern about potential lateral movement or process injection.\n\nLooking further, services.exe is making multiple Registry value sets. Services.exe is a system process, but unexpected registry modifications could indicate tampering, especially if the changes are not related to known updates or configurations. Several such events might suggest an attempt to modify system settings or create persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother event from tarefa_logico.exe loading mscoree.dll and similar DLLs. The name \"tarefa_logico\" translates to \"logical task\" in Portuguese, which isn't a common process name. This could be a custom executable or potentially malicious software trying to blend in. Loading .NET components might indicate it's executing scripts or using reflection, which is often seen in malware.\n\nThere's also an event from svchost.exe making multiple Registry modifications. SvcHost is a known host for various Windows services and can be exploited by malware to run code. Multiple registry changes could be part of creating a new service or modifying existing ones, which is concerning if not related to legitimate updates.\n\nLastly, there's a file creation event in the WindowsUpdate logs directory. This seems unusual because such files are typically created during update processes. An external process creating log files here might indicate tampering with system updates or attempting to hide activities by appending logs.\n\nPutting it all together: Powershell.exe is doing several actions that could be part of a script execution, including creating temporary files and using pipes. Services.exe and svchost.exe are making registry changes which could be persistence mechanisms. The presence of tarefa_logico.exe with .NET loading suggests possible malicious activity. The overall combination of these events points towards potential malicious behavior rather than normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing and loading various DLLs, creating temporary script files, and interacting with registry entries, along with other processes showing similar behaviors, indicate potential malicious activities such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each line is a JSON object representing different parts of the process. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that all these events are coming from either 'Dism.exe' or 'DismHost.exe'. These sound familiar—I think they're related to Windows Deployment Services or something like that. Dism is often used for managing image-based installations in Windows. So, these processes aren't malicious per se; they're part of the system's normal operation.\n\nLooking at the event types, there are two kinds: 'File Executable Detected' from 'Dism.exe' and 'Image loaded' from 'DismHost.exe'. The file paths all lead to a temporary directory under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. The filenames vary but end with .dll, which is common for dynamic link libraries used by Windows applications.\n\nHmm, the 'File Executable Detected' events might trigger some alerts if not familiar, but in this case, since it's Dism.exe, which is a legitimate process, I don't think there's cause for concern. Similarly, the image load events are standard when modules or components are loaded into memory during execution.\n\nI also see that the same temporary directory is being used across all these events. This seems consistent with how Dism and related tools operate—they often extract files to temp directories during deployment or servicing operations.\n\nGiven that all processes are legitimate and the activities described are typical for these system utilities, there's no indication of malicious behavior here. No signs of unusual file accesses, network communications, or other red flags commonly associated with cyber threats.\n\nSo, after analyzing each event and considering their context within Windows operations, I'm confident that this batch isn't interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to legitimate processes (Dism.exe and DismHost.exe) loading standard components during deployment or servicing operations. The activities described are normal for these system utilities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. There are multiple entries here, each with a process name, a Windows log task, and a file path.\n\nFirst, I notice that the first three events involve DismHost.exe loading different DLL files into memory. These seem like normal operations since DismHost is associated with deployment imaging services in Windows, which typically loads various providers during setup or configuration tasks.\n\nThen, from the fourth event onwards, the process name changes to Dism.exe, and the log task switches to File Delete logged. This indicates that Dism.exe is deleting files. The files being deleted are DLLs and MUI (Multi-Use Information) files located in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder.\n\nI'm wondering why Dism.exe would be deleting these specific files. The temporary path seems consistent across all events, suggesting it's part of a single operation or task. Since Dism.exe is legitimate software used for servicing Windows images, its deletion of files might be part of its normal cleanup process after performing some operations.\n\nHowever, I should consider if this activity could indicate something malicious. Malware often uses temporary directories to store files and then deletes them to avoid detection. But in this case, the file names like AssocProvider.dll and their MUI counterparts are standard for Windows components. The paths also align with typical locations where such provider files would be temporarily stored during an installation or servicing process.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that all events come from the same user's profile and point to a single temporary directory makes me think this is part of a legitimate update or configuration change rather than malicious activity. There doesn't seem to be any unusual pattern in the file names or paths that would raise red flags beyond normal system operations.\n\nOn the other hand, if these files were deleted unexpectedly without prior loading or during an unusual time (like outside business hours), it might warrant more investigation. But based on the information provided, there's no clear indication of malicious intent.\n\nSo, while the activity is interesting because it involves deletion of multiple files by a system process, it doesn't cross into suspicious territory given the context and file types involved.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show DismHost.exe loading DLLs and subsequent deletions by Dism.exe.

Let me go through each event and see what they tell me.\n\nFirst, looking at the process information: \"name\": \"services.exe\". Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process that typically runs as part of services management. It's not unusual to see this in logs, so on its own, it doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nNext, the winlog field shows \"task\": \"Logon\". This usually indicates a user logon event. Logon events are pretty common and can be from legitimate user activity or system processes. Without more context, like the source of the logon or the account being used, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nThe file field is None in all these events, which means no file operations were logged. That makes sense for a services.exe process since it doesn't typically interact with files during normal operation.\n\nConsidering the combination of these events: multiple instances of services.exe starting and logon tasks without any associated file activity. I don't see anything that stands out as malicious here. It could just be normal system behavior, possibly related to service management or legitimate user logins.\n\nI don't have enough information to suggest any unusual patterns or activities that would warrant an investigation.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where the process is powershell.exe with specific command lines. The first few events have a command line that creates a new service using New-Service and starts it. That's a bit unusual because creating services can be a common tactic in malware to maintain persistence. But I need to check if this is happening multiple times, which it does—three times with the same command.\n\nThen, there are other events where powershell.exe is used with -ExecutionPolicy Restricted. This means the script is running under a restricted policy, which might prevent some malicious actions but could also be legitimate since sometimes scripts need restrictions. The commands here either write to the host or check for specific patterns in INF files. For example, one command checks if there's a match for a certain string in .inf files, which could indicate some system configuration activity.\n\nLooking at the event types, most of them are 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which relate to service-related activities. There's also one 'Special Logon' event, which is often suspicious because it can be used by malware to maintain elevated privileges or persistence.\n\nI'm concerned because multiple events involve powershell.exe creating services and performing file operations. These actions could be part of a legitimate script, but given the frequency and specific commands, there's a possibility they're malicious. The repeated creation and starting of a service named \"objeto_ativo\" is a red flag. Additionally, the scripts checking for specific patterns in system files might be trying to hide or alter system configurations.\n\nThe use of restricted execution policies doesn't necessarily negate the risk because even with restrictions, certain commands can still execute if they meet the policy's criteria. The fact that these events are spread across different tasks and times makes me think it could be a campaign attempting to establish persistence or check for specific conditions on the system.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows repeated unusual powershell activities which could indicate malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands related to service creation and file system operations, with some events indicating potential persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

It's a bit complex with multiple entries, so I need to parse through each one carefully.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the entries are about processes being created or files being accessed. For example, there's an entry where \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\" is being executed using PowerShell. That caught my attention because executing arbitrary scripts from external locations can be a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nI also see several entries where files are being read, like the user's login script or profile. This could indicate that someone is trying to gather information about the system or perhaps deploying some kind of persistence mechanism.\n\nAnother thing I'm noticing is the use of \"powershell.exe\" with inline scripts. While PowerShell is a powerful tool, it can also be misused for malicious purposes, such as downloading additional tools or executing commands that are harder to trace.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where a service named \"objeto_ativo\" is being created and started. Services are a common way for malware to maintain persistence across reboots, so this could be concerning if not authorized.\n\nI also see multiple events with process creation and file access that don't seem to align with normal user activity. This could mean someone is exploring the system or installing software without proper authorization.\n\nGiven all these points, it's essential to verify each of these activities against known legitimate processes and permissions on the system.

These events are typically generated when user accounts are created on a system. Below is an analysis of the data:\n\n### Event Analysis:\n1. **EventID: 4688**\n   - This event indicates that a new user account was created on the system.\n   - The `TargetUserName` field shows the name of the newly created user account, which in this case appears to be \"objeto_ativo\".\n\n2. **Process Information:**\n   - The process responsible for creating the user account is identified by the `ParentProcessName` and `ParentProcessID`. This information can help trace back to how the user was created (e.g., through a script, GUI tool, or automated process).\n\n3. **User Context:**\n   - The event indicates that the user account \"objeto_ativo\" was created in the context of the \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" account, which means the operation had administrative privileges.\n\n4. **Additional Fields:**\n   - `TargetDomainName`: Specifies the domain where the user account is created. If it's empty or not specified, it indicates that the account is local to the system.\n   - `TargetUserSid`: This is the Security Identifier (SID) for the newly created user account, which can be used for further identification and management of the account.\n\n### Possible Concerns:\n- **Unintended Account Creation**: If this event was generated unintentionally or without proper authorization, it could indicate potential unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n- **Lack of Context**: Without additional context (e.g., who created the account, why it was created), it's challenging to determine if this is a legitimate action.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Review User Accounts**: Regularly review and audit user accounts on the system to ensure that only authorized accounts exist.\n2. **Monitor Account Creation Events**: Set up monitoring for events like EventID 4688 to detect unauthorized account creation promptly.\n3. **Investigate Process Context**: If this event was generated by a specific process, investigate the purpose of that process and ensure it's legitimate.\n\nIf you need further assistance or clarification, feel free to ask!"}
