{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me break down each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the majority of these logs involve `powershell.exe` processes. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities because it has powerful cmdlets that can be abused. The command lines in some of these events show the creation of scheduled tasks using `New-ScheduledTaskAction`, which suggests someone is setting up a task to run at logon. This is concerning because such tasks could be part of persistence mechanisms used by attackers.\n\nLooking closer, these scheduled tasks are being created with specific principals and triggers. The use of `BUILTIN\\Administrators` group and the highest run level indicates that the task has elevated privileges, which is a red flag for potential lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where registry values are being set and files are being deleted. Registry modifications can be part of installing malware or changing system configurations to maintain persistence. The file deletion event shows that a PowerShell script was removed from the user's temp directory, which might be an attempt to erase evidence of malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is the repeated occurrence of these events. The same pattern repeats multiple times with different task names like `registro_geral`, `entrada_temporario`, etc. This repetition could indicate an attempt to create multiple persistence points or test different ways to execute commands, which is typical in a breach scenario.\n\nFurthermore, there are several entries where the process name is None, but the log type is \"Execute a Remote Command.\" This might imply that some remote execution attempts are occurring without being properly attributed to a known process, which could be indicative of command and control (C2) activity or other malicious behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, these events suggest potential unauthorized access or malicious activities. The combination of scheduled task creation with elevated privileges, registry modifications, file deletions, and repeated remote command executions creates a concerning pattern that stands out for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges and deleting files, along with several execute remote commands. Indicators suggest potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: svchost.exe setting a registry value and creating a file in \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum\". Svchost is a legitimate process, but it's often used by malware because many services run under it. The creation of a task could be suspicious if it's not standard.\n\nSecond event: svchost.exe again, this time setting a registry value and creating a file in the same directory as before. Repeating actions might indicate something is being set up for persistence.\n\nThird event: No process name, but an execute remote command. That's concerning because executing commands remotely without proper context can be malicious.\n\nFourth event: powershell.exe setting a registry value. PowerShell is powerful and often abused by attackers. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations.\n\nFifth event: Again, no process, another remote command execution. This repetition might suggest automated or malicious activity.\n\nSixth event: chrome.exe setting a registry value. Chrome's legitimate, but if it's accessing the registry in an unusual way, especially for writing, that could be suspicious.\n\nSeventh event: powershell.exe creating a file in the user's\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell directory. This is where PowerShell profiles are stored. Creating files here might indicate script execution or persistence.\n\nEighth event: chrome.exe loading amsi.dll, which is related to antivirus\/antispyware. Loading this could be normal, but if it's done unexpectedly, it might be an attempt to bypass detection.\n\nNinth and tenth events: More instances of svchost.exe setting registry values and creating files in the same path. The repetition suggests something is being configured persistently across sessions.\n\nEleventh event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file related to its configuration. Winlogbeat is legitimate, so unless it's behaving abnormally, this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nTwelfth and thirteenth events: Powershell.exe creating files in the user's Downloads directory. These could be scripts or malicious files being written for later execution.\n\nFourteenth event: chrome.exe setting a registry value again. The continued activity from chrome is notable and might warrant closer inspection.\n\nFifteenth event: winlogbeat.exe again, similar to before.\n\nLooking at all these events together, there's a pattern of multiple processes (svchost.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe) performing actions like creating files, setting registry values, and executing remote commands. These are common indicators of malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or payload execution. The repetition across different processes adds to the suspicion. However, some events could be benign, especially if these are legitimate actions from installed software.\n\nBut considering the combination, there's enough red flags to suggest that this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activity, such as remote command execution and file creations in suspicious locations by processes like powershell.exe and svchost.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
