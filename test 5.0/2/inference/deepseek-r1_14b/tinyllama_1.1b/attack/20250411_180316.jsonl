These are common for creating or modifying files, which might indicate an attempt to write malicious scripts or configuration changes on the system.\n\nThere's also a File Delete event logged, specifically deleting a PowerShell script from the user's Temp directory. This could be part of an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after executing some code.\n\nThe events show multiple ImageLoad tasks for different DLLs. While this is normal in Windows, combined with other suspicious activities, it might suggest that certain modules are being loaded which shouldn't be there or are used maliciously.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of registry value sets without any associated file changes could indicate an attempt to persistence by adding registry keys to ensure malicious scripts run on startup or at login.\n\nTaking all these together, the consistent use of PowerShell for creating files and modifying system configurations raises concerns about potential malicious activity.

Registry modifications can be part of legitimate operations, but frequent changes might indicate malicious activity.\n\nThere's also a lot of PowerShell activity here. Powershell is commonly used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement because it's powerful and can do many things under the radar. The repeated ProcessAccess tasks on powershell.exe could mean someone is trying to execute commands or access system resources inappropriately.\n\nLooking further, I see cmd.exe being used with specific command lines like \"\/c copy\" which copies files. This kind of file operation could be legitimate, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it raises concerns. Also, the deletion of a task using schtasks.exe might be an attempt to remove traces or disrupt system monitoring.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe multiple times is another point of interest. While it's usually harmless, repeated executions could be part of information gathering by attackers trying to identify user privileges or system configurations.\n\nConsidering all these events together: numerous process creations, file operations, registry modifications, and PowerShell usage—especially the same ones repeatedly—it seems like there's a pattern that could indicate malicious behavior.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being executed with specific command lines. The command lines seem to be checking for the existence of certain .bat files and exiting based on that. That in itself isn't necessarily malicious, but repeated checks might indicate something suspicious.\n\nThen, I notice several entries where powershell.exe loads different DLLs from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. These are standard operations for PowerShell scripts, so not too concerning on their own. However, combined with other actions, it could be a red flag.\n\nThere's an event where a temporary PowerShell script is created and then deleted shortly after. This behavior—creating and immediately deleting files—is often seen in attempts to bypass certain security measures or leave no trace of malicious activity. It raises my suspicion because legitimate scripts usually don't need to delete themselves so quickly unless instructed to do so.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry value sets from both powershell.exe and chrome.exe. While Chrome might have a reason to modify the registry for settings, multiple such events without obvious cause could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms being set up.\n\nLooking at the sequence of events: powershell.exe starts, checks file paths, loads various DLLs, creates a temp script, deletes it, interacts with Defender components, and then chrome.exe makes several Registry changes. This chain seems a bit unusual together. It's possible that this is part of some automated setup or configuration, but considering the deletions and repeated registry access, I'm leaning towards it being potentially malicious.\n\nThe confidence level is around 0.7 because while there are signs of suspicious behavior, they could also be part of legitimate operations.

So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL events and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows Chrome.exe loading an image related to Windows Defender. That seems normal because Chrome would load necessary DLLs.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from cmd.exe setting registry values. Using cmd.exe for registry changes isn't unusual on its own, but repeated attempts might indicate something suspicious. However, I don't see any errors here yet.\n\nThen, powershell.exe is involved in several tasks: accessing processes, setting registry values, loading images, and creating files. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The creation of a new file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1 looks suspicious because it's a script with a random name, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe is called with \"& {}\", which seems odd. This might be an attempt to execute commands without saving the script, reducing the chance of detection. Also, the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks could indicate that PowerShell is being used in a way that's trying to stay under the radar.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. Winlogbeat is likely monitoring logs, so this shouldn't be concerning on its own.\n\nFinally, whoami.exe was executed, which is usually harmless unless it's part of privilege escalation, but without more context, I can't say for sure.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with potentially suspicious command lines and file operations stands out.

That immediately raises some flags because PowerShell is often used by both admins and attackers for various tasks, some of which can be malicious.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. The first few events show powershell.exe accessing different files or modules. For example, 'clr.dll' and 'mscorlib.ni.dll' are legitimate .NET framework components, so that's not suspicious on its own.\n\n2. Some events have command lines with complex paths and checks using Test-Path. These look like they're trying to see if specific script files exist before exiting. This behavior is a bit unusual because it might be checking for the presence of certain scripts or verifying conditions, which could indicate an attempt to execute code only when those files are present.\n\n3. There's a File Delete logged event and a File created event for the same temporary PowerShell script file '__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1'. This is concerning because it shows that a script was deleted after being created, possibly to avoid detection or to remove evidence of its execution.\n\n4. Registry value set events occur, which could be modifying system settings. While legitimate scripts can do this, frequent changes might indicate malicious activity trying to persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe, especially with these specific file operations and registry modifications, suggests potential malicious behavior.

Powershell is commonly used in legitimate scripts but can also be abused by attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities. The presence of command lines with 'if' conditions checking for file existence might indicate a script attempting to verify the presence of certain files, which could be part of malicious activities like ensuring payload components are in place.\n\nLooking at the events:\n\n1. Powershell is being executed with command lines that test if specific paths exist (e.g., Test-Path). This kind of behavior can be part of legitimate checks but might also signal an attempt to ensure malicious files are present or to bypass certain security measures.\n\n2. There's a file deletion event for a .ssp.ps1 script in the user's Temp directory. Powershell scripts, especially those dropped into temporary directories, can be suspicious if they're not related to known processes. The fact that it was deleted shortly after being created raises questions about why such a file was generated and then removed.\n\n3. Registry modifications by powershell.exe could be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations in ways that are not typical for standard operations.\n\n4. Multiple instances of 'whoami.exe' running might indicate attempts to gather user information, which is common in reconnoissance activities before more substantial attacks.\n\n5.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few events show powershell.exe loading various DLLs. That's normal because PowerShell often loads different components when it runs scripts or commands. The next ones have command lines that check if certain paths exist and exit based on that. These look like they're part of some automated checks, maybe to see if a specific file exists before proceeding.\n\nI notice several events where powershell.exe is being executed with similar command-line structures. They all seem to be using an 'if' statement to test the existence of a path and then exit. This repetition could indicate that a script is running multiple checks or perhaps trying different paths in sequence. The fact that they're exiting 0 if the path exists suggests they're verifying the presence of something.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe deletes a file from a temporary directory. Deleting files isn't inherently malicious, but combined with the other activities, it might be part of some script cleanup or persistence mechanism.\n\nAnother point is that one of the events involves whoami.exe being executed. This tool is commonly used to determine user information and is often part of legitimate scripts, especially during system administration tasks. However, in the context of multiple PowerShell executions, it could be checking permissions or user identity as part of a larger script's operation.\n\nLooking at the file paths involved, they're spread across different directories like C:\\modulo_geral, C:\\entrada_logico, and others. The scripts are using relative paths which might make them more flexible but also harder to trace if they're part of malicious activities. The temporary files mentioned in some delete events could be an attempt to clean up traces.\n\nThe repeated use of 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks in the logs suggests that there's a lot of activity related to script execution, possibly from multiple sources or different parts of the system. This might indicate a script running with several steps or modules being loaded, which is normal but could also be part of a larger, potentially malicious process.\n\nOne thing I'm considering is whether these scripts are legitimate administrative tasks or if they're signs of something more nefarious like credential dumping, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement within the network. The deletion of specific files and the repeated checks on various paths might be an attempt to cover tracks or ensure certain conditions for further actions.\n\nThe confidence level here is around 0.7 because while there are some red flags, such as multiple PowerShell executions and file deletions, they could also be part of a legitimate automated process or script.

My goal is to determine if these events as a whole are interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Powershell Execution with Test-Path**: The first event shows `powershell.exe` being run with a command that checks if a specific .ps1 file exists in a certain path. If it doesn't exist, the script exits with code 0; otherwise, it exits with code 1. This might indicate an attempt to check for another script's presence, possibly malicious.\n\n2. **Multiple Powershell Instances**: There are several entries where `powershell.exe` is accessed or loads images. Each time, different files or tasks are logged. For example, there's a file creation of a temporary .ps1 file in the Windows Temp directory. This could be part of script execution or testing.\n\n3. **File Creation and Deletion**: A temporary PowerShell script is created and later deleted. This behavior might suggest that the script is being used temporarily and then cleaned up to avoid detection, which is common in malicious activities.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**: There are instances where `powershell.exe` modifies registry values. Registry changes can be a red flag because attackers often use them for persistence or configuration of malicious tools.\n\n5. **Network Activity from svchost and chrome**: The events show network connections from both `svchost.exe` (a common Windows process that can host various services) and `chrome.exe`. While Chrome's network activity is normal, seeing it alongside potential malicious processes like Powershell could be suspicious.\n\n6. **Multiple Similar Powershell Commands**: Several entries repeat similar Powershell command lines with variations in the paths being checked. This repetition might indicate an attempt to check multiple locations for a specific file, possibly indicating reconnaissance or trying to locate a dropped payload.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of Powershell with different commands, the creation and deletion of temporary scripts, registry modifications, and network connections from non-standard processes like svchost.exe suggest possible malicious behavior. These activities could be part of an attack chain, such as script testing, file presence checks, persistence mechanisms, or data exfiltration.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to definitively say whether this is an actual breach. Some of these actions could also be legitimate system administration tasks using Powershell for scripting and management. But the combination—especially the temporary file creation\/deletion and multiple registry changes—does raise red flags indicating potential malicious activity.\n\nGiven the number of events related to Powershell, which is often a vector for attacks due to its powerful scripting capabilities, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting.

The command line shows script execution using ls and get-childitem recursively. That's red flag because PowerShell scripts can execute arbitrary commands and are often used in attacks.\n\nThere are ProcessAccess tasks and Create events which indicate the process was started and accessed. This aligns with executing a script, so that's concerning.\n\nThe file creations under Temporary and AppData folders for PS1 files are suspicious. Malware often creates temp files to store malicious scripts or logs.\n\nRegistry writes are another concern since attackers might modify system settings to maintain persistence.\n\nFile deletions of the created .ps1 files could be an attempt to remove evidence, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nPipe Creation events suggest communication between processes, possibly for command and control.

My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually and then see how they might connect.\n\nThe first event has the process name as 'powershell.exe' with a command line that's a bit unusual. The command line includes '&', which in PowerShell is used to chain commands together. The commands listed are 'ls -recurse', 'get-childitem -recurse', and another 'gci -recurse'. This seems like it's listing files recursively, possibly trying to gather information about directories and files. However, the way it's written might be a bit obfuscated because of the line breaks and multiple similar commands. Obfuscation in PowerShell is often used by attackers to hide malicious activities.\n\nNext, the second event shows 'conhost.exe' being executed, and the Windows log indicates that a registry value was set. Conhost.exe is typically related to console windows, but seeing it combined with a registry change might be suspicious. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes for malicious scripts.\n\nThe third event again involves 'powershell.exe', this time noting that a file was created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\estrutura_secundario.txt'. The creation of new files, especially in user directories, could be an attempt to drop files or write data. It's worth checking what content is being written here.\n\nThe fourth event also involves 'powershell.exe' and mentions a process access event, meaning another process might have accessed it. This could indicate some form of inter-process communication, which might not be suspicious on its own but could be part of a larger malicious activity chain.\n\nPutting this all together: the batch shows multiple PowerShell executions with potentially malicious command lines, registry modifications by conhost.exe, file creation in user directories, and process access events. These activities are red flags for potential malicious behavior because they involve:\n\n1. Powershell being used with obfuscated or multiple commands that could be trying to hide their true purpose.\n2. Conhost.exe modifying the registry, which is often a way to establish persistence or change system configurations.\n3. Creation of files in user directories without clear legitimate justification, especially when combined with other suspicious activities.\n\nThe confidence level here is high because each event on its own might not be too concerning, but together they form a pattern that suggests possible malicious activity, such as information gathering (via 'ls' and 'gci') followed by file creation and registry changes to maintain persistence or execute further actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious command lines, a registry modification by conhost.exe, file creation in user directories, and process access events.
