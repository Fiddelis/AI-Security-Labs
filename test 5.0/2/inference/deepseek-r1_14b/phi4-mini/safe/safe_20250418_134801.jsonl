These seem to be standard npm package names. \n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here.

I recognize that node_modules is a standard directory for Node.js packages, so Git is likely cloning or fetching dependencies here.\n\nEach event is just a file creation task by Git.exe, which is normal during development when managing packages with npm or yarn. There's nothing unusual about creating these files; it's part of the typical setup process for a project using semver (a package manager tool for semantic versioning).\n\nSince all events are consistent and related to legitimate operations by a well-known application, there doesn't seem to be any signs of malicious activity or anomalies that would require investigation.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating a file. That makes sense because Edge updates often download and install new versions. The path looks legitimate, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext up is MpCmdRun.exe loading an image. MpCmdRun is part of Windows Defender, which is a known process for antivirus tasks. It's normal to see it load modules or files during scans.\n\nThen there's another MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe event, but this time it's deleting a file from the user's temp directory. The filename seems related to Edge updates again. This could be part of the update process cleaning up after itself, so that's expected behavior.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe appears again with more image loads and creating temporary files. All these activities are typical for Defender as it scans and runs its processes.\n\nI see conhost.exe modifying a registry value. Conhost is often used by scripts or command-line tools to host console windows. It's not inherently malicious, but I should keep an eye on what else is happening around this event.\n\nThere are several git.exe events creating files in the node_modules directory. The paths point to a user working with Node.js packages, specifically semver. This looks like normal development activity, so nothing unusual here.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these events involve standard processes: updates, antivirus operations, and software development. While there's no clear indication of malicious behavior, the conhost.exe registry modification is slightly concerning because it could be a sign of script or remote activity. However, without more context on what triggered that event, I can't say for sure if it's malicious.\n\nConsidering all events collectively, they don't present a strong pattern of suspicious activity. They seem to be normal operations except for the conhost.exe part, which might warrant closer monitoring but isn't conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of normal system processes such as update activities, antivirus operations, and file creation\/deletion by legitimate applications like Microsoft Edge Update and Windows Defender.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL logs where each line represents an event from the Windows log. Each event has three parts: process info, winlog details, and file information.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, they all have \"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"}, which means git is being executed. The task in the winlog is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a file was created. The file paths are all under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\", with various package names like shebang-command, shebang-regex, side-channel, and signal-exit.\n\nSo, putting this together, it seems like git is cloning or pulling a repository because node_modules suggests it's part of a Node.js project. The multiple files being created under node_modules are typical during an npm install or when initializing a new package. \n\nNow, considering whether this is interesting for investigation: these events look normal for someone working with JavaScript and using version control systems like git. There's nothing here that stands out as malicious or unusual activity. It's standard file creation during development setup.\n\nTherefore, I don't think there's anything suspicious here. The batch doesn't indicate any signs of compromise or malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by the git.exe process while setting up Node.js packages, indicating routine development work rather than malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The process name is consistently \"git.exe\", which immediately makes me think it's related to Git operations like cloning repositories or managing projects. \n\nThe task in each event is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so they're all about file creation events. The files being created are located under a path that includes \"node_modules\". Node Modules typically contain dependencies for JavaScript applications, especially with Node.js.\n\nLooking at the specific files, I see names like index.js, signals.js, package.json, .travis.yml, Jenkinsfile, and various .js files within subdirectories. This seems consistent with a user installing or updating Node.js packages using npm, which often happens during development work.\n\nThe repetition of these events all from git.exe suggests that it's part of the process of setting up or modifying a project's dependencies. Since all events are about creating files in a standard node_modules structure, there's no indication of any malicious activity here.\n\nI don't see anything out of the ordinary or suspicious.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. I'm trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first two events are about MicrosoftEdge_X64.exe creating and changing the creation time of a file in the EdgeUpdate directory. That seems normal because Edge updates might need to create temporary files during installation.\n\n2. Next, CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll, which is related to antivirus scanning. Also, it's loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. These are standard system processes and shouldn't raise any red flags.\n\n3. There are events about user account management without process or file details. This could be normal user logon\/logoff activities.\n\n4. Services.exe logging on—this is a common system service that manages other services, so nothing suspicious there.\n\n5. The event with taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll also looks routine since Task Scheduler uses this DLL.\n\n6. Then there's a powershell.exe command being executed with the command line showing some activity with .inf files. This catches my attention because using PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious. The script is checking for specific patterns in INF files, which might indicate an attempt to detect or interact with certain drivers or components. It could be benign administrative work or potentially something more nefarious.\n\n7. Svchost.exe modifying registry values a couple of times. This is normal since many services run under svchost and make registry changes as part of their operation.\n\n8. The winlogbeat.exe creating files in its directory seems related to log management, likely from the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). If this tool was installed on the system, it's normal for it to create configuration files during setup or updates.\n\n9. Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll—again, standard behavior as many executables use URL-related functions for various purposes, including legitimate ones.\n\n10. Svchost.exe creating files in the Delivery Optimization Cache. This is part of Windows Update and is used for optimizing file downloads, so that's normal activity.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: Most are routine system operations like process creation, file I\/O, DLL loading, and registry modifications. The only event that stands out is the powershell.exe command checking .inf files for specific patterns. While not inherently malicious, it could be a sign of suspicious activity if executed by an unauthorized user or in an unusual context.\n\nHowever, without additional context—like whether this PowerShell execution was triggered by another process or if there's any deviation from baseline behavior—it's hard to definitively classify the batch as malicious. It might just be a system administrator running a script for troubleshooting or configuration purposes.\n\nTherefore, while there is a potentially concerning event, it doesn't meet the threshold for being clearly malicious when viewed in isolation and within the context of typical system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly normal system activities with no clear indicators of malicious behavior. The PowerShell command might be suspicious but lacks additional context to confirm as malicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}

That seems a bit odd because git usually handles version control, not file creation in node modules. Node modules are typically installed by npm, not git. So why is git creating these files?\n\nLooking at the paths, they all point to different .js and .json files within various subdirectories of node_modules. This could be part of a script or build process that's using git for some reason, but it's not common. Alternatively, maybe someone is running a command that generates files as part of a setup.\n\nBut wait, if this activity is legitimate, why would git create so many files in one go? It seems like a lot, especially with specific file types. Could this be an attempt to inject malicious scripts or modify existing ones?\n\nI should consider the user context too.
