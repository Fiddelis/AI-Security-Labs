Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in specific paths. The file paths all seem to be under the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory, specifically within OfflineFiles folders. Each event has a unique filename with different hashes, like excel-copilot-strings followed by various GUIDs.\n\nI remember that SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Office's Save As dialog and managing files. These events are likely part of normal operations where offline copies or resources are being saved or accessed. The fact that they're all under the same parent directory suggests it's a legitimate process for Office features, maybe related to Copilot functionality.\n\nThere are a couple of other processes too: consent.exe loading some system DLLs, and MdSched.exe starting up. Those also seem normal since consent.exe is part of Windows and AMSI\/DLLs are standard system components. MdSched.exe is known to be part of the Windows Update process for managing scheduled maintenance.\n\nSo, putting it all together, all these events fit within expected behavior for a Microsoft Office environment. The repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe don't raise any red flags because they align with how Office handles offline resources and package management. No signs of unusual processes, unexpected files in strange locations, or indicators of malicious activity like multiple failed attempts or writes to restricted areas.\n\nTherefore, I'd classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING because all activities are consistent with normal operations and there's no evidence of suspicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate file creation by SDXHelper.exe related to Microsoft Office resources, which is expected behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of JSONL events to analyze. Let me start by looking at each event individually. Each one has a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\", which is triggering a \"File created\" event under the rule FileCreate. The file paths all point to different .js files located in the same directory within the user's AppData folder, specifically under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages.\n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar. I think it's related to some kind of system utility or maybe a legitimate software component. Since it's creating multiple files, perhaps these are configuration or resource files being downloaded or cached. The paths include \"OfflineFiles\", which suggests they might be part of an offline package for Office features.\n\nLooking at the file names, they all follow a pattern with hashes and version-like suffixes. This could indicate that each file is unique but part of the same package. It's not uncommon for applications to create multiple files in such directories during setup or updates.\n\nI notice that some file paths are repeated, like \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_cae61a256865f559df4b5852830ad9c5.js\" appears twice. Maybe it's a duplicate entry or the system is retrying the creation after some delay.\n\nConsidering all events together, they seem to be part of normal Office setup processes. The same process creating multiple files in a standard location doesn't raise any red flags for malicious activity. There's no indication of access to sensitive areas, unusual file names, or deviations from expected behavior.\n\nSo, I think this batch is probably not interesting from a security standpoint. It looks like legitimate operations by a known Microsoft-related process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a standard Office directory, likely part of normal updates or caching.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. All the events have similar structures, each containing a process name \"SDXHelper.exe\", a file creation task in Windows logs, and different file paths. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze if these events together are interesting or not for investigation. The process is named \"SDXHelper.exe\"—I don't recognize that as a common system process, so it's probably related to some application. The files being created are JavaScript files located in the Office Solution Packages under different folders like vendors~something.js and excel-copilot-strings_ something.js.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within Microsoft Office's local directory structure. That makes me think that SDXHelper.exe is part of an Office add-in or some component related to Office features. The repeated patterns in the filenames suggest these might be cached resources for features like Copilot, which is a feature introduced by Microsoft.\n\nThe fact that multiple files are being created with similar names but different hashes could indicate normal operation—like how applications cache different versions or updates. However, since all events are file creations from the same process and located in expected areas, there's no immediate sign of malicious activity like deletions, unusual access times, or writes to unexpected locations.\n\nBut I should consider if repeated file creation is part of a legitimate update process or could it be something more sinister. In this case, since all files are in known Microsoft Office directories and the process name isn't flagged as malware, it's likely normal behavior.\n\nI'm not seeing any signs of exfiltration, encryption (which would indicate ransomware), or other malicious patterns across these events. They seem to be part of a standard process for an application to set up its resources.\n\nSo overall, while I don't have complete certainty, the pattern doesn't raise red flags. There's no indication of unauthorized access or data breaches here. It seems more like legitimate file operations by a component within Office.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation activities by SDXHelper.exe in expected Microsoft Office directories, likely part of normal application behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. So I've got a bunch of JSONL events here. Each line represents an event where a file was created by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". The same pattern repeats multiple times with different filenames.\n\nFirst off, I need to figure out if these events are interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. \"SDXHelper.exe\" sounds familiar—it might be related to Microsoft Office, possibly part of some add-in or tool. The file paths all lead to the same package ID within the Office directory. Each event creates a JavaScript file with varying filenames but following a similar naming convention.\n\nHmm, multiple files being created by the same process in quick succession could be normal during an update or installation. Since these are just file creation events, and they're happening in a known Microsoft directory, it's less likely to be malicious activity. No signs of unusual paths or writes to restricted areas.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known for anything suspicious. A quick search tells me it's associated with Office Add-ins, specifically Copilot features. So these files are part of the Copilot language models being downloaded or cached. The filenames look like hashes or GUIDs, which is typical for such cached resources.\n\nConsidering all this, the events don't show any red flags. They're standard operations by a legitimate process creating necessary files in an expected location.

These packages often contain additional features or resources used by Office applications. The repeated creation of files with similar names suggests they're being downloaded or cached as part of normal operation.\n\nEach file path ends with a different hash-like string, which likely corresponds to unique versions or components within the package. This pattern is typical when an application is updating or installing multiple files, especially in an offline scenario indicated by \"OfflineFiles\".\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity here. All events are consistent with standard file creation during normal software operation. The same process creating several files in a known Microsoft Office directory reinforces this view.\n\nTherefore, the batch doesn't raise any red flags. It's likely just part of the regular operation of the Office suite, possibly during an update or cache refresh.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in a known Microsoft Office directory, consistent with normal software operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Let's see... Each line is a JSON object with process info, a Windows log event, and file details.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that almost all the events are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in a specific path under Office's SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like excel-copilot-strings followed by various hashes. This seems repetitive—like multiple entries of similar files being created.\n\nThen there's one event from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a configuration file, which is expected if that's the log collection tool running.\n\nI'm wondering why SDXHelper.exe is creating so many files with these specific names. Could it be related to Office add-ins or updates? Maybe it's part of normal operation when installing or updating packages. The paths look legitimate for user-specific data.\n\nBut wait, multiple identical entries might indicate something suspicious. If the same file is being created twice, could that mean an error or potential tampering? Also, all these files have .js extensions—JavaScript files. Sometimes malicious scripts are embedded in such files, but without looking at the content, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother angle: The process name SDXHelper.exe—I'm not familiar with this exact name, but Office-related processes can vary. It might be a legitimate helper process for Office add-ins or updates.\n\nConsidering the justification needs to be concise and confident, I think there's some cause for interest because of the multiple identical file creation events from the same process. However, it could also just be normal activity. Without more context, like timestamps showing rapid succession or unusual access patterns, it's on the lower end of suspiciousness.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events from SDXHelper.exe targeting specific JavaScript files suggest potential investigation warranted.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system events and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, they all have the same structure: a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files under the same path in the user's AppData directory. Each file has a different hash-like filename, but all are within the \"OfflineFiles\" folder of an Office package. \n\nI know that \"File created\" events can be normal or malicious. Since all these events are from the same process and the same location, it might indicate legitimate activity, like software updates or configuration changes. The path seems to relate to Microsoft Office's solution packages, which are usually for add-ins or features.\n\nHowever, the repeated creation of multiple files by the same process could also be suspicious. Malware often creates multiple files quickly, maybe to spread out over time or avoid detection. But in this case, all events seem sequential without other indicators like unusual file names or locations outside expected paths.\n\nI should consider the source of \"SDXHelper.exe\". If it's part of known legitimate software, especially Microsoft Office, then these events are normal. The files being created are likely cache or resource files needed by the Office AI Copilot feature, as indicated in their naming.\n\nBut why so many? Maybe an update or installation process is happening. Sometimes software updates download multiple resources at once. Alternatively, it could be a script generating test files, but that's less common.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here, like file creation in system directories or attempts to execute code. The paths are confined to the user's local AppData folder, which is typical for application data.\n\nSo, while the number of events stands out, they don't indicate anything malicious based on what I can tell from this log snippet. It might just be a normal update or cache refresh by Microsoft Office.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch consists of multiple file creation events by \"SDXHelper.exe\" within the same directory. These files are part of an Office package and likely legitimate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events from a known process (SDXHelper.exe) in a standard location for Microsoft Office resources, indicating normal activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a file in specific locations within the Office app's SolutionPackages directory. The paths point to various JavaScript files, some related to \"officeaicopilot\" and others to \"word-copilot\". \n\nFirst off, I notice that all these events are from the same process name: SDXHelper.exe. That makes me think it's part of a legitimate Office application since Microsoft uses such names for their components. The task being logged is a file creation event, which isn't inherently suspicious on its own.\n\nHowever, there are multiple entries with different file hashes or identifiers in their paths. For example, the \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" files have various suffixes like d11781d2fe5fa91a..., and similar patterns for other files. This repetition suggests that these might be temporary or cached files being generated as part of normal operations.\n\nI'm also considering whether multiple file creation events could indicate something malicious, like a script dropping several files quickly. But since they're all under the Office directory and have predictable naming conventions, it seems more likely they're part of regular updates or cache activities rather than malicious behavior.\n\nAnother angle: Could this be related to a known issue with Office's update mechanism? Sometimes legitimate software can exhibit such file creation patterns when updating or installing new features. The presence of \"copilot\" in the filenames makes me think these might be AI-related features, which are common in recent Office versions.\n\nI should also check if SDXHelper.exe is a known malicious process. From what I recall, it's associated with Microsoft's Diagnostics and Office setup, so it doesn't have a history of being malware.\n\nPutting this together: The same process creating multiple files in expected locations for legitimate features, no signs of unusual patterns or deviations from normal behavior. Therefore, these events are probably not indicative of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe within standard Office directories suggest normal operations rather than malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I've been given three JSONL events to analyze as a cybersecurity expert. My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually to understand what they're indicating. Each line represents an event where a file was created by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". The files in question are JavaScript files located within the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory under specific package IDs.\n\nI know that SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Diagnostics Hub, used for gathering system information to troubleshoot issues. Its legitimate purpose includes creating and managing diagnostic data. The paths provided point to specific files related to Word's Copilot feature and AI copilot chat strings. These files are typical in an Office installation, especially with features like Copilot enabled.\n\nLooking at the events, I don't see any immediate red flags. There's no indication of unauthorized access, unusual file permissions, or suspicious timestamps that might suggest malicious activity. The creation of these JavaScript files is a standard operation during the setup or update of Office features. Since all three events are similar and originate from the same process without variations in file paths or other indicators, it doesn't raise concerns about lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nI should also consider if there's any pattern that might be concerning even though each event seems benign on its own. For example, repeated attempts to create the same files could indicate issues with how they're being handled by the application, but that doesn't necessarily point to malicious behavior. It's more likely a bug or misconfiguration in the software.\n\nIn terms of confidence level, I'm pretty sure these events are normal. However, since I don't have access to real-time data or additional logs beyond this batch, my confidence is high but not absolute. If there were deviations from expected patterns or other correlated events, I might reconsider. But based on what's provided, it's safe to classify them as \"NOT INTERESTING.\"\n\nFinally, I'll structure the response in the required JSON format, ensuring that only one classification and justification are provided for the entire batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file creation activities by a known Microsoft process related to Office features.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
