All the events seem similar; each line is a JSON object with three main parts: process, winlog, and file.\n\nLooking at the process part, they all mention \"git.exe\". That's interesting because Git is commonly used for version control in software development, so it's not unusual to see it creating files. Now, the winlog task says \"File created\" each time, which means a new file was made on the system.\n\nThe file paths are pointing to various .d.ts files inside a cypress node_modules folder. Specifically, these files like invoke.d.ts, isBoolean.d.ts, etc., are part of Cypress's type definitions for lodash functions. That makes sense because when you install and use Cypress for testing, it includes type definitions which might be generated or accessed during the setup process.\n\nI'm noticing that each event creates a different file in this cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp directory. The filenames follow a pattern related to Lodash's utility functions, such as isBoolean, isArray, etc. So, this seems like Git is cloning or updating a repository and creating these files as part of the process.\n\nNow, considering if this batch is interesting for investigation: since all events are consistent and relate to normal file creation during development tool setup, there doesn't seem to be any malicious activity here. No signs of unexpected processes or access to sensitive areas—just standard operations related to building or testing a project with Cypress.\n\nI should also think about the confidence level.

Git is commonly used for version control and might be running some scripts or processes as part of a development environment. The creation of multiple .d.ts files under the cypress directory suggests that this could be related to a Cypress project setup or a developer's workspace where such dependencies are being managed.\n\nI should consider whether these events are normal. Developers using tools like npm or yarn might trigger file creations in node_modules during installations or updates. Since all these files are part of a typical node module structure, their creation by git.exe doesn't immediately raise red flags unless there's something unusual about the paths or the number of files created.\n\nBut wait, could this indicate malicious activity? It's possible that an attacker is using git.exe as a vector, but in this case, the files are standard definitions for lodash functions. Unless these files have been tampered with or are part of a larger pattern of suspicious activities (which isn't evident here), I don't see a clear sign of malicious behavior.\n\nThe justification for classification would depend on whether such activity is typical in the environment. If this is a system where developers are actively working, these events might be normal and not interesting. However, if this system isn't supposed to have development tools or if git.exe shouldn't be running certain operations, then it could warrant investigation.\n\nGiven that all events show similar file creations under a standard project structure and there's no indication of deviations from expected behavior, the batch as a whole seems non-malicious.

The process name in every case is \"git.exe\", which suggests that Git is being used here. The task logged is always \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate\". That makes me think these are normal file creation events triggered by Git operations.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to specific .d.ts files within a node_modules folder.

These look like standard TypeScript type definitions that would be part of a typical project setup using Node.js and Git.\n\nNow, considering the context, when someone is working with version control systems like Git, creating files in node_modules is common during installations or updates of packages. This is especially true for tools like Cypress, which might require certain types to be generated or updated.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. The paths are deep within a user's directory structure, which is expected for development environments. There's no indication of unusual file names or locations that might hint at malicious activity. Each event seems consistent with normal Git operations, possibly during a clone, fetch, or install process.\n\nSince all the events are related to creating type definition files and involve a standard tool like Git, there's nothing here that stands out as suspicious.

Each JSON object has three main keys: process, winlog, and file. \n\n- **Process**: All entries have \"git.exe\" as the name. That makes sense because Git uses its own executable to perform operations.\n  \n- **Winlog**: The task here is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\".

The rest of the path varies but seems to be related to a Cypress module and various .d.ts files.\n\nI'm thinking about what these events mean. Git is often used in development environments, so it's common for developers to clone repositories or work with code. The creation of multiple files under node_modules suggests that perhaps someone is setting up or modifying their development environment. These could be TypeScript type definitions, given the .d.ts extensions.\n\nI wonder if creating a bunch of files at once is suspicious. In some cases, mass file creation might indicate something malicious like dropping files during an attack. However, in this case, all the events are related to the same process (git.exe) and the same user directory. The files being created are part of a Cypress module, which is commonly used for testing in JavaScript projects.\n\nI should consider the context. If \"fiddelis\" is a legitimate user working on their project, these file creations might just be part of installing or updating dependencies. Git could be cloning a repository or fetching updates, leading to the creation of multiple files in the node_modules directory.\n\nAnother angle: Could this activity be related to malicious software? The process is git.exe, which is standard for version control. Malware often uses legitimate tools to avoid detection, but the file paths here don't seem unusual for development activities.\n\nI also think about how many events there are. There are 15 entries, each creating a different file in the same directory. This might be part of a script or automated process during setup, which isn't inherently suspicious unless it's part of an attack chain I'm aware of.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though not provided), if these events occurred over a short period, it could raise an eyebrow, but without that context, it's hard to say.

The filenames vary but they all end with \".d.ts\", which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files. These files typically define interfaces and types used in a project, especially when using tools like TypeScript or certain JavaScript libraries.\n\nSince the process is \"git.exe\", it suggests that Git is creating these files. In software development, especially with version control systems like Git, it's common for scripts or processes to generate or update files during operations such as cloning repositories, pulling updates, or running build scripts. Node_modules is a directory where JavaScript libraries are stored in npm-based projects, which aligns with the presence of \"cypress\" and \"lodash\" directories—both are popular npm packages.\n\nLooking at the specific filenames like \"isMap.d.ts\", \"isNaN.d.ts\", etc., these seem to be type definitions for utility functions. Lodash is a well-known library that provides utility functions, and having declaration files for them makes sense in a TypeScript project where you'd want clear type information.\n\nI don't notice any anomalies or red flags here. All the events are consistent with normal file creation activities during development workflows.
