{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL logs here. Each line seems to represent an event with process information, Windows log details, and file info.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of these events involve powershell.exe being executed. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for scripting and can execute malicious commands. The command lines in some events show that they're creating scheduled tasks using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask. These tasks are set to run at logon with the highest privileges under BUILTIN\\Administrators, which sounds suspicious.\n\nLooking deeper into the command line arguments, each one is similar but has different task names like \"registro_geral\" or \"tarefa_base\". This repetition suggests that an attacker might be creating multiple scheduled tasks to ensure persistence across reboots. The use of calc.exe as the execute action could be a simple test or part of a larger payload delivery mechanism.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe is accessing processes and registry values, which aligns with how attackers typically try to maintain access and hide their activities. Additionally, there's an event from chrome.exe setting a registry value, but since it's a legitimate process doing its thing, that might not be too concerning on its own.\n\nThe file paths in some events point to .NET framework DLLs being loaded by powershell.exe, which isn't inherently malicious but could indicate that the script is using .NET components for more complex operations. However, without seeing the full context of how these are used, it's hard to say if this is part of normal operation or something else.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple scheduled tasks created with elevated privileges, process and registry activity from powershell.exe, and file access patterns that don't look entirely innocent. This batch seems to indicate potential malicious activity, especially considering the combination of events rather than isolated ones.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. So, first, I'll go through each event one by one and note down the key points.\n\nThe first few logs are from powershell.exe. One of them shows that a file was loaded: MpOAV.dll. That's part of Windows Defender, so that seems normal. Then there's a file created in the temp directory with a PowerShell script name: __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. Hmm, that looks like it could be some kind of test or maybe a malicious script. After creating this file, another event shows that the same file was deleted. So powershell.exe created and then deleted a temp script.\n\nLooking further down, there's a process where powershell.exe is used with a command line that creates a scheduled task. The command runs calc.exe at logon with admin privileges and highest run level. That sounds suspicious because it's adding a persistent task using administrative access. Maybe this is part of persistence for malicious activities.\n\nThen I see several events from chrome.exe modifying the registry, but those are less concerning unless they're doing something unusual, which isn't clear here. The rest of the logs show multiple \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks with no process or file info, which could be either normal admin tasks or signs of remote attacks.\n\nPutting this together: there's activity where powershell.exe is creating and deleting a script in temp, then setting up a scheduled task to execute calc.exe at logon. That seems like it could be part of an attack chainâ€”using PowerShell for lateral movement or persistence. The repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" events might indicate remote control attempts.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because the powershell activity looks potentially malicious, especially the scheduled task setup. However, sometimes legitimate scripts can do similar things. But considering all the events together, including multiple remote command executions, it raises the confidence level that something is off.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activity, including script creation and deletion, and a scheduled task execution with elevated privileges. Combined with numerous remote command attempts, this indicates potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to spot any anomalies or signs of malicious activity.\n\n1. **Event 1**: PowerShell is being executed with a command that creates a scheduled task. The script is attempting to register a new task under \"unidade_comum\" which translates to \"common unit\". This seems suspicious because it's using a high privilege level (Administrators group and Highest) and is trying to run calc.exe on logon. Scheduled tasks created by scripts, especially with elevated privileges, can be indicators of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Event 2**: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. This process is related to Windows Management Instrumentation and is often used for legitimate system management tasks. However, paired with the previous event, it's worth noting but not immediately suspicious on its own.\n\n3. **Events 3-4**: svchost.exe making registry changes. svchost is a common host process for services, so some registry activity isn't unusual. But multiple such events might indicate something more.\n\n4. **Event 5**: Another svchost creating a file in the Tasks folder named \"unidade_comum\". This aligns with the scheduled task created earlier, which adds context to these actions.\n\n5. **Event 6**: An event labeled \"Execute a Remote Command\" without any process name, which is concerning. It's hard to say what this means without more data, but it could be an attempt to execute commands remotely, which is a red flag.\n\n6. **Events 7-8**: PowerShell creating files and modifying the registry again. The file paths seem normal for user-specific configurations, but combined with previous events, there's potential for concern.\n\n7. **Event 9**: conhost.exe modifying the registry. Conhost is associated with console windows; unusual activity here could be malicious, but not definitive on its own.\n\n8. **Events 10-23**: Chrome.exe showing multiple registry modifications and a DNS query. While excessive registry access can be suspicious, it's also common for applications like Chrome to make such changes. The DNS query might be normal browsing activity.\n\n9. **Events 24-25**: winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files, which is expected if the tool is being set up or updated. No immediate red flags here.\n\n10. **Events 26-27**: PowerShell creating additional files in user directories. Again, could be legitimate, but combined with prior events, it's worth monitoring.\n\nNow, looking at the entire batch, several points stand out:\n\n- The use of PowerShell to create a scheduled task that executes calc.exe on logon is concerning. This is a common tactic for persistence.\n- Multiple registry modifications and file creations by svchost.exe could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n- The event with \"Execute a Remote Command\" adds another layer of suspicion, suggesting potential remote execution activities.\n\nWhile some events individually might not be alarming, the combination suggests possible malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is worth investigating further to confirm if these actions are part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges and potential remote command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
