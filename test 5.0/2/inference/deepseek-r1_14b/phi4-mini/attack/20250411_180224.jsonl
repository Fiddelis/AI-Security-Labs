I'm presented with a batch of system events and need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user has provided two JSONL events.\n\nFirst event:\n- Process name is whoami.exe, executed from C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe.\n- Windows log indicates it's a process creation event (Process Create).\n\nSecond event:\n- Process name is powershell.exe.\n- Windows log shows it's a process access event (ProcessAccess).\n\nSo, I need to analyze these two events together. Let me consider what each of these processes typically do.\n\nWhoami.exe is a standard system utility that outputs information about the current user and their permissions. It's commonly used by admins for troubleshooting and doesn't inherently indicate malicious activity. However, if executed in an unusual context or with certain parameters, it could be suspicious, but here it's just being run normally.\n\nPowershell.exe is more concerning because it's a powerful tool often used by both admins and attackers. The ProcessAccess event suggests that another process is accessing powershell.exe. That could mean legitimate use, like launching it from another script or application, but it can also be a sign of malicious activity, such as code injection or execution.\n\nLooking at the combination, having whoami followed by powershell access might seem normal in some contexts, like during system administration tasks where scripts are run to check user permissions. However, without additional context (like time stamps or other events), it's hard to say definitively.\n\nThe key point is that while each event individually isn't alarming, together they could hint at a potential script or tool being used to gather information about the system, which might be part of an attack chain. The confidence level here is moderate because there's no clear indication of malicious intent but enough to warrant closer inspection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes events involving whoami.exe and powershell.exe, which could indicate potential system reconnaissance or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is a process create for cmd.exe with a command line that runs schtasks to create a task. It looks like it's setting up a scheduled task. The command inside the task runs another cmd which executes powershell with some arguments, but I notice the script paths are NonExistingScript.ps1 and entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. That seems odd because those files don't exist on the system, so maybe this is an attempt to run a malicious script.\n\nThe second event shows cmd.exe accessing registry values. Since cmd is being used here, I wonder if it's setting some registry keys as part of the attack.\n\nThen there are multiple events where powershell.exe is accessed and file creations happen. The first time powershell runs, it creates estrutura_geral.txt, which I can't verify existence. Another event shows a file creation for entrada_ativo.txt by powershell. These could be logs or configuration files used by the malicious script.\n\nLooking further, schtasks.exe is involved in creating and querying tasks. The command line for one of them has another non-existing script path. This suggests that an attacker is trying to create persistent tasks using schtasks, which is a common technique for persistence.\n\nI also see several Registry value set events from svchost.exe and chrome.exe. That's a bit confusing because I know svchost is a legitimate process but it can be used by malware. The multiple registry changes might indicate installation or configuration of malicious components.\n\nThere are file creation events involving winlogbeat.yml.new, which seems like an EDR-related file being updated. Not sure if that's related to the attack or just normal operation.\n\nPutting this all together: cmd and powershell executing with non-existing scripts, schtasks creating tasks with suspicious command lines, multiple registry changes from svchost.exe, and several file creations from powershell all point towards potential malicious activity. The repeated attempts to execute non-existent scripts could be an attempt to bypass detection or execute arbitrary code.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is a false positive, but the combination of process creation, registry modifications, and suspicious file operations makes me think it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show cmd.exe creating scheduled tasks with non-existent scripts, schtasks.exe accessing system resources, and multiple powershell executions indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
