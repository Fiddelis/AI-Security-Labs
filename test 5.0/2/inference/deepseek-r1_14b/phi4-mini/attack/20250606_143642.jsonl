{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, I've been given a bunch of JSONL events where the process is always Dism.exe and each event has some file information. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Dism.exe does. From what I know, Dism.exe is related to Windows Deployment Services. It's used during the installation or configuration of Windows to deploy images, configure settings, etc. So it's a legitimate system process.\n\nLooking at each event, the common elements are that the process name is Dism.exe and the file path is in a temporary directory under C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with some GUID-like folder names. The files being accessed have extensions like .dll, .mui, etc., which are standard for DLLs and language resource files.\n\nThe tasks logged are either \"File Executable Detected\" or \"File created\". Since Dism.exe is a legitimate process, these events could be part of its normal operations. It's possible that during the deployment or configuration, it creates temporary files and marks them as executable when necessary.\n\nI should check if all these file names make sense for Dism.exe to interact with. The paths like CbsProvider.dll, DismCore.dll, etc., seem related to Windows components and deployment. Also, the language-specific .mui files suggest that they are being loaded for UI localization, which is standard during setup processes.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. All events are consistent with normal operations of Dism.exe, no signs of unusual file names or paths, and no evidence of executables outside its typical functions. Since all these activities align with what I'd expect from a legitimate system process during deployment, this batch likely isn't malicious.\n\nSo, putting it together, the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's nothing in the events that suggests suspicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to Dism.exe performing normal file operations during deployment or configuration.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool for both admins and attackers, so any unusual activity could be suspicious. The first few events show tasks like Pipe Created and Image loaded. That's normal for powershell when it starts up, but I'll keep an eye out for anything more malicious.\n\nThen there's a process creation of whoami.exe. Whoami is usually harmless, used to check user info. But sometimes attackers use it to gather information. The command line looks standard here, so maybe not too concerning yet.\n\nNext, another powershell instance starts with some arguments. The command line has an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted and a script that checks for .inf files looking for specific patterns. That seems a bit fishy because checking .inf files could be part of lateral movement or privilege escalation. I remember that attackers often look into system32 directories, so this might indicate reconnaissance.\n\nLooking further, powershell loads various DLLs which is normal, but the file creation in the Temp directory under a specific path makes me think about script-related activities. The filename includes \"wf5ajhez.sfd.psm1\" which doesn't ring any bells immediately, but it's another indicator that powershell is executing some scripts.\n\nThen there are cmd.exe and Dism.exe processes. The command line for cmd.exe is trying to disable Windows Defender using Dism with specific switches. Disabling defender could be a red flag because attackers often try to stop security tools. The fact that this is done via Dism, which is a legitimate tool but can also be used maliciously, adds to the concern.\n\nThe subsequent events show File Executable Detected for AppxProvider.dll and AssocProvider.dll by Dism.exe. These files are related to package provisioning in Windows, so maybe the attacker is trying to remove or modify system packages, which could be part of a more serious attack like removing antivirus or other protective measures.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell running scripts that check for specific .inf files, disabling defender, and modifying system components. These activities don't look like normal user behavior and could indicate an attempt to gain persistence, escalate privileges, or remove security features. The combination of these events suggests a potential attack in progress, so the batch is definitely interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with potentially malicious commands, including disabling Windows Defender and script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

They all seem to involve processes related to Dism.exe and DismHost.exe. The paths in the file fields are pointing to a temporary directory with various .dll files. I know that Dism is usually part of Windows for servicing operations like installing updates or creating repair images, so it's legitimate.\n\nEach event shows tasks like \"File Executable Detected\" or \"Image loaded.\" These are standard Windows events when processes load libraries. The repeated loading of DLLs by DismHost.exe in the same temp directory doesn't raise red flags because such behavior is typical during servicing operations.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual activities, like failed logon attempts, writes to unexpected files, or network connections. All file paths are temporary and consistent with normal Windows updates or system repairs. So, this batch isn't particularly interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate operations by Dism.exe and DismHost.exe loading DLLs from a temporary directory, which is typical during system servicing or updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm given a set of JSONL events where each line is an event with process, winlog, and file info.\n\nLooking at the first few events, DismHost.exe is loading several DLL files into memory. That seems normal for system processes, especially if it's related to image loading rules.\n\nThen, I notice that starting from the 5th event, the process changes to Dism.exe, and the task becomes 'File Delete logged'. The same temp directory paths are being deleted. Deleting files after using them isn't unusual, but the fact that multiple DLLs and their MUI files (which are resource files for localization) are being deleted in sequence is a bit concerning.\n\nDism.exe is related to Windows deployment services, so it's legitimate, but why delete all these specific files? If this were part of a normal cleanup process, maybe just one or two files would be deleted. Deleting multiple related files might indicate something more malicious, like an attempt to remove evidence after execution or part of a payload delivery.\n\nThe paths are temporary and the same across events, which suggests they're from a single operation. The combination of loading and then deleting these DLLs could mean that DismHost.exe loaded them, executed some code, and then Dism.exe cleaned up, which might be normal, but the volume here raises flags.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is malicious or just part of some legitimate process, like cleaning up after a deployment. However, the patternâ€”loading multiple DLLs followed by their deletionâ€”isn't typical and warrants closer investigation to ensure no unauthorized activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletions from a temporary directory after loading several dynamic link libraries (DLLs) may indicate suspicious activity, such as cleanup after malicious code execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. There are 14 entries here, each one is a JSON object with three main fields: process, winlog, and file.\n\nFirst off, the process field shows that all these events are coming from \"Dism.exe\". I know that Dism.exe stands for Deployment Image Service Installer. It's a standard Windows tool used for servicing Windows images, like installing updates or adding drivers. So by itself, seeing Dism.exe in logs isn't unusual.\n\nNext, looking at the winlog field, each entry has a task of \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\". That tells me that something is triggering the file deletion detection rule every time. It's logging that files are being deleted, but since it's from Dism.exe, I need to consider whether this activity is normal for that process.\n\nNow, looking at the file paths, all these deletions are happening in a temporary directory under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a specific GUID-like folder name. The files being deleted have names like \"DmiProvider.dll.mui\" and others ending with \".dll.mui\". These look like language-specific resource files for various providers, possibly related to system setup or servicing.\n\nPutting this together, Dism.exe is known to perform tasks like extracting files from packages during deployment or updates. It's common for it to delete temporary files after they've been processed. The fact that multiple such files are being deleted in a loop (14 events) suggests that this is part of a routine processâ€”maybe an update installation, system servicing, or a similar operation.\n\nI don't see any signs here of malicious activity like unusual file paths, execution from unexpected locations, or deletions of system-critical files. All the files are within the expected temporary directories and match known patterns for Dism.exe operations.\n\nSo, considering all these pointsâ€”normal process, expected task, standard file operations in a temp directoryâ€”it's not raising any red flags. The events don't indicate anything out of the ordinary or malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Dism.exe deleting temporary files, which is normal during system servicing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's look through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where the process is Dism.exe deleting files from a temporary directory. The paths are all under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with different DLL files. That seems normal because Dism.exe is usually used for servicing Windows, like deploying updates or modifying system images. It often creates and deletes temp files during its operations.\n\nThen there are several events from powershell.exe. Some involve file creation and deletion, registry access, and image loading. For example, one event shows a PowerShell script removing an item in the Temp directory. This might not be suspicious on its own since admins sometimes use PowerShell for cleanup or scripting tasks. Also, there's an event where a specific PowerShell command is executed to delete a .zip file, which could be part of normal operations.\n\nLooking at other processes like services.exe and svchost.exe accessing registry values isn't unusual either. These are system processes that often interact with the registry for configuration.\n\nI should check if any of these events indicate malicious activity. The fact that multiple files are being deleted by Dism.exe doesn't raise a red flag since it's part of standard operations. The PowerShell activities seem to be legitimate, especially if they're part of automated scripts or system maintenance tasks.\n\nThere's no evidence of processes running without proper permissions, unusual file accesses outside the user's temp directory, or signs of persistence mechanisms that would indicate malware. All the events are within typical Windows operational patterns.\n\nTherefore, considering all these events together, there doesn't seem to be any malicious behavior here. It looks like standard system operations and script executions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes such as file deletions by Dism.exe, PowerShell executions for tasks like file deletion and registry access, and other standard system activities.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of 14 events. Each event is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nThe process name in all these events is 'Dism.exe'. I know that Dism.exe is related to the Deployment Image Service Installer, which is part of Windows for installing and configuring Windows images. It's a legitimate system tool, so seeing it execute isn't unusual on its own.\n\nNext, the winlog field consistently shows a task named 'File Delete logged' with the rule 'FileDeleteDetected'. This indicates that each event is logging a file deletion. The fact that multiple files are being deleted could be part of a normal system operation or something malicious.\n\nLooking at the file paths, all of them are located in a temporary directory under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. Temporary files are commonly created and deleted by applications as part of their normal operations. Dism.exe is known to create temporary files during its processes, such as when applying updates or servicing images.\n\nEach file being deleted has names like 'TransmogProvider.dll.mui' and others. These seem to be DLLs which are common in Windows for various services and components. The presence of these files in a temp directory suggests they were perhaps extracted during some operation and are now being cleaned up, which is typical behavior.\n\nConsidering the frequency, there are 14 events all related to Dism.exe deleting files from the same temp directory. This could be part of a bulk deletion process after an installation or update. Since Dism.exe is a known legitimate tool, this activity doesn't raise red flags immediately.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether such a high volume of deletions is normal. While it's possible during certain operations, without more context, it might still seem excessive. But given that all events are consistent and from the same process, there's no evidence of unusual patterns or variances in user activity that would suggest malicious intent.\n\nIn summary, while the number of events is notable, they all point to legitimate system processes. There's no indication of unauthorized access, unknown executables, or atypical file deletions beyond what Dism.exe typically does during its operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletion events by Dism.exe in a temporary directory are likely part of normal system operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format with each line containing a JSON object. Each object has three keys: process, winlog, and file. \n\nLooking at the 'process' field, most events have a command line starting with powershell.exe. The commands seem to be executing some scripts. The first few entries are running a PowerShell command that checks for specific patterns in .inf files located in the Windows directory. It's searching for lines like \"[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]\". That seems unusual because it's looking into system files, which could be part of some system check or potentially malicious activity.\n\nThen there are multiple events where PowerShell is used to remove a specific file from the Temp directory. The command is 'Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force'. This is concerning because deleting files in the Temp directory can be part of hiding traces, especially if it's targeting a specific file pattern.\n\nThe 'winlog' field shows tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which are related to Windows service or component start\/stop events. However, combined with the PowerShell commands, this context might indicate some background process being managed by these services, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's normal.\n\nThe 'file' field is None in all cases, so there's no additional file information to go on.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe running scripts, some checking system files for specific patterns and others deleting temp files. The repetition of these commands across several events suggests a possible automated process or script execution. While not necessarily malicious on their own, the combination could indicate suspicious activity such as attempting to remove logs or traces, which is common in malware behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the actions taken by PowerShell could be indicative of malicious intent, especially the deletion of files and the checking of system configurations. However, without more context on what these scripts are supposed to do, my confidence isn't 100%. It's a moderate concern.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands that check for specific patterns in system files and delete temporary files.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out what's going on here. So, I see a bunch of logs from Windows Event Viewer, specifically under the \"Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon\/Operational\" channel. The user has provided several JSON objects with different fields like process information, Windows event data, and file details.\n\nFirst, I notice that most entries have a \"process\" field containing command-line arguments executed by PowerShell with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. This means the scripts are running in a restricted environment, which is common for security reasons to prevent malicious code execution. The commands being run vary from simple writes to the console (Write-Host) to more complex operations involving file reads and pattern matching.\n\nLooking closer, there's a recurring script that checks for specific sections in INF files located in the Windows directory's \"inf\" folder. It uses Get-Item to retrieve all .INF files and then iterates through each one, reading their content with Get-Content. The script is looking for lines that match a regular expression pattern like \"\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\]\". This suggests the script is trying to detect if any of these INF files contain installation configuration sections relevant to different processor architectures.\n\nThe fact that this check is being performed multiple times across several log entries indicates it's part of a larger process or script. Perhaps it's part of an automated system checking for certain software installations or configurations on the machine. Since the user hasn't specified, I'm not sure if this activity is legitimate or potentially malicious, but given the restricted execution policy, it might be a script run by an organization for specific monitoring purposes.\n\nI also see that some logs mention \"Provider Lifecycle\" in the winlog field, which relates to Windows event providers starting or stopping. This could be part of the system's normal operation when services start up or shut down.\n\nAnother point is the presence of multiple entries with similar command lines but different tasks in the Windows log. Each task corresponds to a specific phase of the script execution, like provider lifecycle events, engine lifecycle, and process creation. This suggests that the script is executing through various stages, each generating its own event log entry.\n\nThe user also provided an example response where someone identified that the script is checking for specific sections in INF files related to installation configurations. They mentioned that this could be used for legitimate purposes like software inventory or malicious activities like persistence mechanisms. My initial thought is similarâ€”if this activity is authorized, it's probably benign. However, without knowing the source of these scripts, there's always a chance they could be part of an attack.\n\nI should also consider whether these processes are running with elevated privileges since they have access to system directories and can execute PowerShell scripts. If these are legitimate, they might be part of system administration tasks, but if unauthorized, they could indicate a breach or malware activity.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, the script reads each INF file's content and checks for specific patterns. This kind of behavior is often used in penetration testing to gather information about installed software or configurations. Malware might use similar techniques to identify targets or persistence points.\n\nAnother angle is that this script could be part of a larger attack chain, such as initial access, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The detection of specific INF sections might be a way for attackers to determine the system's architecture or installed software, which they can then exploit.\n\nI should also think about how an analyst would approach this. They'd likely check the process path and hash to see if it's known malicious, look into the script's origin (like who triggered its execution), and assess whether such scripts are common in the environment. Monitoring for repeated access attempts or unusual file accesses could help detect potential threats.\n\nIn summary, while the activity seems technical and possibly legitimate, especially given the restricted PowerShell policy, it's crucial to verify the source and purpose of these scripts. Without additional context, it's hard to definitively say whether this is a threat or not, but being cautious and investigating further is advisable.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs you've shared show that a PowerShell script is running in restricted mode on your system. The script is checking for specific patterns in INF files located in the Windows directory. Here's what we can deduce:\n\n1. **Script Execution**: The script runs under a restricted execution policy, which means it can't execute other scripts or access certain potentially dangerous functions.\n\n2. **File Access**: The script accesses `.INF` files in the Windows `\\inf` directory, which is common for system configuration files.\n\n3. **Pattern Matching**: It looks for sections in these files that match `[defaultinstall.nt]` followed by specific processor architectures (like `amd64`, `arm`, etc.). This suggests the script might be checking for installed software or drivers specific to certain hardware configurations.\n\n4. **Potential Uses**:\n   - **Legitimate Use**: The script could be part of system administration tasks, such as inventorying installed software or drivers.\n   - **Malicious Use**: Malware might use similar techniques to identify system configurations for targeted attacks.\n\n5. **Investigation Steps**:\n   - Check the process path and hash to verify if it's known malicious.\n   - Look into who triggered this script execution (user, service).\n   - Review the script's origin and whether such scripts are common in your environment.\n   - Monitor for repeated access attempts or unusual file accesses.\n\nIf you're unsure about the script's purpose, consider running it through a sandboxed environment to analyze its behavior safely."}
