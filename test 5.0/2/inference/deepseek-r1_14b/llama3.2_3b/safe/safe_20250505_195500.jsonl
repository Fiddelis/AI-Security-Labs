I recall it's part of Microsoft Office, used for handling updates or solution packages. So it's likely a legitimate process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under the user's AppData directory within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. That seems normal because software often stores its resources there. The filenames are JavaScript files with hashes in their names, which suggests they might be static assets like strings or configuration data for Office add-ins.\n\nThe repetition of certain file paths and hashes indicates that these are multiple instances of the same file being created, possibly during an update or installation process. It's common for software to create multiple resource files when setting up new features or updates.\n\nIs there any sign of suspicious behavior? I don't see anything unusual in the event types—just FileCreate events from a known Microsoft-related process. No signs of unexpected locations or file names that stand out as malicious.\n\nI also consider whether this could be part of an attack like mass file creation to hide something, but given the consistent naming and structure under Office's directory, it doesn't raise red flags.

Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nEach line is a JSON object representing an event. They all have the same structure: process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\", task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the file path points to various .js files in the OfflineFiles folder under a specific SolutionPackage.\n\nHmm, first thought: This seems repetitive because every single event is almost identical except for the filename part. The same process is creating multiple files in quick succession. I wonder if this is normal behavior for that application or if it's something suspicious.\n\nI know that legitimate applications sometimes create multiple files when they initialize, especially during updates or cache setup. But SDXHelper.exe... does that ring a bell? Maybe it's part of Microsoft Office, given the path structure and the \"Microsoft\" in the file location. So perhaps this is normal for Office to create these offline files.\n\nBut on the other hand, if an application is creating multiple files rapidly, especially with different hashes or versions, maybe there's something malicious trying to establish persistence or download components. But looking at the filenames, they all seem like static strings, which doesn't indicate dynamic generation typical of malware.\n\nAnother point: The process name being the same across all events suggests it's a single process handling multiple file creations, which is normal for apps that cache resources.\n\nI should also consider how many files were created. There are 15 events here. That might not be excessive if it's part of a legitimate setup process, but it could also be an indicator if the number seems unusually high compared to typical operations.\n\nThe confidence level: Since all the events follow a similar pattern and fit within expected behavior for an Office-related process, I'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING. But there's a small doubt because sometimes attackers can mimic legitimate activities, so maybe a lower confidence in that assessment.\n\nI think the justification is solid—normal file creation by a known Microsoft-associated process.

Each event has a process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating multiple files in the same directory with varying file paths ending with different hash-like strings.\n\nFirst, SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office's Solution Packages. These packages are legitimate and part of Office features like AI Copilot. The repeated creation of files suggests an update or cache mechanism for these resources.\n\nThe file paths all point to the same parent directory but have unique filenames. This pattern is typical when software updates or caches multiple resources, especially scripts, which is common in applications like Office that use web-based components.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The process name is known, and the actions are standard for resource file management. There's no indication of unusual access times, writes to unexpected locations, or other red flags typical in malicious events.\n\nTherefore, these events likely represent normal operation rather than anything suspicious.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of the events are coming from \"SDXHelper.exe\". This process is creating multiple files in the same directory under \"PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\". The file paths all have similar names but different hashes at the end, which suggests they might be different versions or chunks of a larger file. For example, \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_01b1c4d03464acf87b14647f4dc2c34f.js\" and others.\n\nI know that legitimate software updates often break files into parts for easier downloading or to handle different regions or languages. However, I'm also aware that some malware uses similar tactics to avoid detection by creating multiple small files instead of one large malicious file. So this could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the types of events, they're all \"File created\" tasks from Windows logs. This is pretty common for processes installing or updating software. But the repetition makes me wonder: why are so many similar files being created? Maybe it's normal for an Office update, but sometimes attackers use this as a way to distribute components across multiple files to evade detection.\n\nAnother thing I'm considering is the path structure. The location under \"AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\" seems legitimate since that's where Microsoft Office typically stores data and add-ins. But again, malicious actors can mimic such paths to blend in with normal traffic.\n\nThere's also an event from \"chrome.exe\" loading a system DLL (\"BitsProxy.dll\"). While this isn't unusual on its own, it's worth noting because sometimes attackers replace legitimate files with malicious ones or use these files for persistence. I should check if BitsProxy.dll is known to be malicious, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event labeled \"Security Group Management\" without a process or file path, which might indicate some group policy changes or user activity related to permissions. While not directly suspicious on its own, in combination with the other events, it could hint at privilege escalation attempts if these groups are being modified improperly.\n\nI'm also thinking about the frequency of these events. If \"SDXHelper.exe\" is generating a lot of file creation events quickly, that might be indicative of an update process or something more nefarious like dropping multiple payload components. The fact that there are duplicate entries with slightly different filenames suggests either redundant writes or perhaps failed attempts, but again, it's not conclusive.\n\nI should consider the source of \"SDXHelper.exe\". If I'm not familiar with this process, a quick check could reveal its legitimacy. It might be part of Microsoft Office services or third-party software used by Office. If it's unknown or has suspicious origins, that increases the concern level.\n\nLooking at the file names again, they all end with \".js\", which is JavaScript. While scripts can be malicious, many legitimate processes also create or use JS files. Without seeing the content of these files, it's hard to tell if they're harmful.\n\nI'm thinking about potential indicators here: multiple file creations by the same process in a short time, all in a user-specific directory, with varying hashes. These could be signs of data being written during an update or installation, which is normal, but also possible signs of malicious activity trying to stay under the radar.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm about 75% sure that this batch is interesting because while some of these events might be legitimate (like Office updates), there are enough red flags in the volume and repetition that warrant closer investigation. It's not a clear-cut case of malware, but it does raise questions that need to be explored further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe suggest potential malicious activity or unusual updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that most events are coming from two processes: chrome.exe and SDXHelper.exe. The tasks vary between Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, and File stream created.\n\nLooking at the first event, chrome.exe is loading urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate Windows system file. That's normal behavior for Chrome.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe creates files in the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory. These paths look like standard locations where Office might store temporary or package-related files. The filenames include hashes and \"strings.min\", which suggests they're possibly JavaScript resource files for some feature—maybe AI Copilot related?\n\nThere are multiple events from both processes, but particularly a lot of FileCreate tasks by SDXHelper.exe. It's creating several files with similar naming conventions. I'm wondering if this is part of a legitimate update or cache process.\n\nThen there are two events where chrome.exe sets registry values. That could be normal for setting preferences or extensions.\n\nToward the end, chrome.exe creates file streams related to an Excel file in the Downloads folder. The filename includes \"Zone.Identifier\", which I recognize as a zone identifier used by Windows to mark files downloaded from the internet. This might indicate that Chrome is handling a downloaded file and setting its properties.\n\nLooking at all events together, they seem to be part of standard operations: loading DLLs, creating temporary files, registry updates, and managing downloads. There's no evidence of unusual processes or access to sensitive areas beyond what you'd expect from these applications.\n\nHowever, the sheer number of FileCreate events by SDXHelper.exe is a bit high. It might be worth checking if this process is running as expected during this time, but without more context, it's hard to say definitively. The files created are in standard locations and don't appear malicious at first glance.\n\nI'm leaning towards these being legitimate activities because all the actions align with normal operation logs for these processes. But I should note that the high number of file creations could be something to watch if this behavior is unexpected or occurs frequently, as it might indicate a resource-intensive process or potential misuse.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events are normal operations by legitimate processes such as Chrome and SDXHelper.exe, including loading DLLs, creating files in standard locations, registry updates, and handling downloads.

The paths are all under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages, which sounds legitimate since it's part of Office setup. These events repeat a few times with similar file names. Maybe this is just normal Office updates or package installations.\n\nNext, there are several entries from \"EXCEL.EXE\". One event shows Excel being launched with a specific file path, which seems like standard user activity. There are also ImageLoad and RegistryEvent tasks loading system DLLs, which again sounds normal for an application running on Windows.\n\nThen, I notice \"chrome.exe\" loading the urlmon.dll, which is a common system file used by browsers for URL handling. That doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nThere's an event from \"svchost.exe\" modifying the registry, but svchost is a known process that runs various services, so it's not inherently suspicious unless it's doing something unusual, which this doesn't seem to be.\n\nSome events have null values for process and file, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's relevant. The \"User Account Management\" task could be normal user activity or system processes handling accounts.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, most of these events are related to legitimate processes: Office applications, Chrome, system DLLs, and registry modifications by known processes. There's no evidence of unusual behavior like repeated failed logins, access to unauthorized files, or network connections that stand out as malicious.\n\nI also don't see any signs of process injection, unknown file creations outside expected paths, or activities typical of malware such as multiple attempts to modify system configurations or delete\/shadow files.\n\nWhile it's always good to monitor for anomalies, in this case, the events seem consistent with normal user activity involving Microsoft Office applications and standard system processes.

The filenames include hashes, likely used by the system or application to manage different versions or cache.\n\nNow, considering \"SDXHelper.exe\" – I'm not immediately familiar with this process, but it's related to Microsoft Office since the path is under the Microsoft folder. Maybe it's part of some office add-in or a helper service for Office applications.\n\nThe events all show files being created, which isn't inherently malicious. However, multiple file creation events from the same process could be suspicious if they're creating many files quickly or in unexpected locations. But here, the files are all under an expected Microsoft Office directory, and each has a unique hash, suggesting they might be legitimate cached resources.\n\nAnother angle is to check for unusual patterns. If \"SDXHelper.exe\" isn't typically associated with file creation events, especially multiple ones in quick succession, that could raise flags. But since I don't have information on normal behavior of this process, it's hard to say. However, given the structure and location, these seem like they might be part of a legitimate update or cache refresh.\n\nI should also consider if there are any anomalies in timestamps or file sizes. Since all events are provided together, I can assume they're from a short period. If \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating many files rapidly, that could indicate something's off, but again, without context on what's normal for this process, it's challenging.\n\nLooking at the files themselves, since they're minified JS, there's no obvious malicious code indicated here. The fact that multiple versions are being created might be standard behavior for Office to handle different scenarios or updates.\n\nIn summary, while the volume of file creation events is notable, the location and context (Microsoft Office directory) suggest these could be legitimate activities rather than signs of a breach.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe under a Microsoft Office directory, likely related to legitimate cached resources.

Each event reports that a file was created, with the task being \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". \n\nLooking at the files being created, they all have paths starting with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office... followed by different package resources. Some of these files are JavaScript and SVG icons, like gl-es-ui-strings-json_0861ab052548d03508e72c866d11b0b7.js and icon_built_in_svg_icon_d92d9c61a31aac539c90417dbdb34416.js.

The task is \"File created\", which suggests files are being written. The file paths look like they're under the user's AppData directory within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. Each event has a different language code in the filename—like 'ka-ge', 'kk-kz', etc., so these seem to be localized string resources for UI elements.\n\nNext, there's an event from \"EXCEL.EXE\" performing DNS queries and multiple registry value sets.

Each line represents an event. I'll go through each one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first two events have \"EXCEL.EXE\" as the process and a task of \"Registry value set.\" That's interesting because Excel is a common application, but modifying the registry can sometimes be malicious if done without proper authorization. However, in this case, it's just setting a registry value, which could be legitimate for configuration purposes.\n\nNext, there are four events with no process or file information—just \"None\" tasks. These seem like they might not provide much context and could be background processes or noise.\n\nNow, looking at the majority of the events, they all involve \"SDXHelper.exe.\" The task is \"File created,\" and each event specifies a path under the user's AppData directory within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files being created are JavaScript resource files with various language codes like ca-es (Spanish), cs-cz (Czech), etc., suggesting these might be localized resources for some application.\n\nI'm wondering what \"SDXHelper.exe\" does. A quick mental note tells me that this might be related to Microsoft Office add-ins or solutions, as it's located in the SolutionPackages directory. These packages often contain additional features or language packs for Office applications.\n\nThe repetitive nature of these events—each creating a file with different resource names but all under the same structure—is typical during an installation or update process. It seems like the helper executable is installing various localized resources, which isn't unusual if it's part of a legitimate software setup.\n\nHowever, since there are multiple instances of \"File created\" tasks from the same process, I need to consider whether this volume is normal. If SDXHelper.exe is running as part of an update or installation, creating several files makes sense. But if this activity happened suddenly without prior notice, it could be suspicious.\n\nI also notice that all events except for the first two have similar file paths and processes, which might indicate a focused activity on resource deployment. There's no indication of access to sensitive areas beyond the AppData folder, which is expected for user-specific data.\n\nConsidering all this, the activities don't seem malicious at first glance. They appear related to legitimate software operations—Excel configuration changes and resource file installations. Unless there are additional indicators like unusual file names or unauthorized access patterns, I wouldn't classify this batch as concerning.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing the entire set, it seems that while there's some activity worth noting, it doesn't reach the threshold for being considered malicious or requiring immediate investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal Excel registry modifications and file creation activities related to Microsoft Office language resources.

The specific path is under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. This indicates that SDXHelper.exe is part of an Office add-in or similar application. These files might be localization strings for the UI, given the naming like \"lt-lt-ui-strings-json\" and others.\n\nWhat stands out is that each event creates a different file with varying language codes (like lt-LT, lv-LV, etc.).

There's no indication of file creation in system directories or other red flags like unusual paths or repeated attempts to create the same file.\n\nThe fact that each event creates a unique file with different language codes doesn't raise any red flags. It appears to be standard behavior for an application handling multiple languages. The repetition is due to the process setting up various localized resources, which isn't suspicious in this context.\n\nTherefore, considering all events together, there's no malicious pattern here. They all stem from a legitimate application's operation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe, which is likely part of Microsoft Office setup or update process for localization files. This activity is normal and not indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
