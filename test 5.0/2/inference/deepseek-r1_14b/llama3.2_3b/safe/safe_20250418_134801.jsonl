{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm supposed to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Each line is a separate event, all generated by the process \"git.exe\". The task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so these are file creation events.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\semver\\\". Inside that, there are various files under subdirectories like classes and functions, each named with different .js files. So it seems like these are JavaScript files being created in a node_modules directory.\n\nNode_modules is a standard folder in Node.js applications where third-party packages are stored. The \"semver\" package is commonly used for handling semantic versioning, which is part of many software projects. Git.exe creating these files could be during the installation or update process of dependencies, perhaps when running npm install or similar commands.\n\nSo each event represents a file being created by git.exe in this context. Since node_modules and semver are standard, there's nothing unusual here. These events don't indicate any malicious activity or anything out of the ordinary for a development environment.\n\nI should consider whether multiple file creations from git.exe could be suspicious. In some cases, bulk file creation might be a sign, but in this case, it's just part of the normal setup process. Each file is expected and necessary for the semver package to function properly.\n\nTherefore, these events don't raise any red flags.

Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few events involve Microsoft Edge Update processes creating files and changing their creation times. That sounds normal because Edge updates often need to download and install new versions. Then there are several User Account Management tasks, which might be related to user login or group policy changesâ€”also routine unless they're happening excessively.\n\nI notice a PowerShell process running with an execution policy set to Restricted. It's querying some .inf files looking for specific strings. This could be part of normal system checks or updates, but it's worth noting because PowerShell is often used in scripting and could potentially be malicious if the script does something unexpected.\n\nThere are multiple ImageLoad events from various executables loading DLLs like amsi.dll, taskschd.dll, and urlmon.dll. These are standard Windows components, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nSome svchost.exe processes are creating files related to DeliveryOptimization and Cache. Svchost is a legitimate process used by services, but if it's creating too many files or accessing unusual paths, that could be concerning. However, the paths mentioned seem typical for system optimizations.\n\nA few FileCreate events from MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe downloading an Edge installer also look normal as part of the update process.\n\nThere are some null entries where processes or files aren't specified, but these might just be incomplete log entries and not relevant to security.\n\nOverall, most activities here appear routine. The PowerShell script is a bit notable because it's checking for specific patterns in .inf files, which could be part of legitimate software installation or updates. Without more context on unusual behaviors like repeated failures, access to restricted areas, or unexpected file modifications, I wouldn't classify this as particularly concerning.\n\nTherefore, the batch doesn't seem to indicate malicious activity but might require closer monitoring if such activities occur frequently or in conjunction with other suspicious events.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show normal system processes and updates, including Microsoft Edge updates, legitimate file creations, and user account management tasks.

Each event seems to be a file creation notification from the Windows log. The process name is git.exe every time, and each event has a file path under node_modules\/tcomb\/lib with different filenames like Boolean.js, Date.js, etc.\n\nFirst thought: git.exe is commonly used for version control, so it's normal for it to create files during operations like cloning repositories or installing dependencies. These file paths look like they're part of a Node.js module since the directory structure under node_modules indicates that.\n\nBut wait, why are there multiple entries? It seems each event corresponds to a different file being created. Is this batch showing a series of file creations happening around the same time? Maybe during a module installation or when running npm install.\n\nI should consider if these activities indicate anything malicious. File creation by git.exe in a typical project directory doesn't raise red flags on its own. However, sometimes attackers might use common tools like git for malicious purposes, but in this case, the file paths seem legitimate and part of standard Node.js libraries.\n\nThe number of events is 16, each creating a different file under tcomb. It seems systematic, which aligns with normal development activities rather than random or sporadic file writes that might indicate malicious behavior.\n\nI don't see any indicators of compromise here. The files being created are all part of the expected modules and scripts in a Node.js project. There's no evidence of unusual access times, file names outside standard conventions, or other anomalies that would suggest an attack.\n\nSo, putting it all together: these events look routine for someone using git to manage their codebase with Node.js modules.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the data, each event is in JSONL format, which means one JSON object per line. Each entry has three main fields: process, winlog, and file. \n\nThe \"process\" field consistently shows that the process name is \"git.exe\". That makes sense because Git is a version control tool commonly used for code management. It's not unusual to see it creating files, especially in a development environment.\n\nNext, the \"winlog\" task is labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So all these events are indicating that a file was created. The rule being referenced is about file creation, which is a common event in logs when new files are added to the system.\n\nLooking at the \"file\" field, each entry has a \"path\" attribute. These paths are all within the user's Downloads directory under a folder named after their institution (inatel), specifically in a course called \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". The subdirectories like \"node_modules\", \"test\", and others are typical for a Node.js project structure. For example, \"node_modules\" is where npm packages are stored when using Node.js.\n\nThe specific files created include various JavaScript files (like index.js), configuration files (tsconfig.json), package.json which lists dependencies, README.md and LICENSE.txt files which are standard for open-source projects. There's also a bin directory with executable scripts like sshpk-sign and sshpk-verify. These all look like normal components of a software project setup.\n\nConsidering the process involved is git.exe creating these files, it aligns with typical Git operations such as cloning a repository or initializing one. The file paths and names don't indicate any signs of malicious activity. There's no indication of unusual directory traversal, creation of hidden files, or execution of scripts that aren't part of standard project setup.\n\nMoreover, the fact that all events are about file creation in a structured manner suggests this is part of a legitimate development process rather than something nefarious like a ransomware encryption or unauthorized access. If it were malicious, I'd expect to see more varied activities beyond just creating files, such as modifying existing ones, deleting them, or attempting to execute code.\n\nThe user's activity pattern also seems normal for someone working on a software project, given the course name and file structure. There's no evidence of multiple failed login attempts, unusual access times, or other red flags that could indicate an attack.\n\nIn summary, all events are related to legitimate Git operations creating standard project files in a typical development environment. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies are present in this batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by the git.exe process during what appears to be a software development setup, with all files located in expected directories for a Node.js project.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at multiple JSONL entries here, each line seems to be a log event. Each event has three main components: process info, winlog details, and file information.\n\nFirst, the process name in all these events is \"git.exe\". That makes sense because Git is often used for version control, especially with Node.js modules as seen in the file paths. The task under winlog is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates that a file was created on the system.\n\nLooking at the files being created, they're all located in different subdirectories within \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\". For example, there are entries for \"string-width\", \"strip-ansi\", \"strip-final-newline\", etc. These look like standard Node.js packages and their associated filesâ€”like package.json, index.js, readmes, licenses, and so on.\n\nI remember that when you run commands like `npm install` or `git clone`, Git might create new files or directories as part of the cloning process, especially if it's downloading dependencies. The fact that all these events are from the same user and involve creating files in a node_modules directory suggests this is related to installing Node packages.\n\nThere's nothing unusual hereâ€”no signs of permission changes, access to restricted areas, or other red flags typical of malicious activity. All the paths seem legitimate for a development environment. The frequency of file creations also seems normal; when setting up a project, especially one with multiple dependencies, you'd expect several files to be created.\n\nI should consider if there's any context missing. For example, are these events happening over an unusually short period? If they're all within a few seconds or minutes, that might raise suspicion because Git shouldn't create so many files that quickly unless it's a very large repository. But looking at the file paths, each is a separate module, which makes sense for npm installations.\n\nAlso, the process name being consistent as git.exe across all events supports the idea that this is a normal part of using Git and Node.js together, like during an install or clone operation.\n\nIn conclusion, these events don't show any signs of malicious behavior. They're typical activities associated with setting up a development environment, specifically related to Node.js modules.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of files during a Git operation involving Node.js modules, indicating normal development activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
