I'm looking at multiple events from the same user account named \"fiddelis.\" The events are related to processes like Update.exe and Discord.exe.\n\nFirst event: Update.exe is being run with a command line argument that includes \"--install .\". That's interesting because it suggests an installation process, but I need to see if this is part of normal software updates or something malicious. \n\nNext, there's a file creation event for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is likely the log collection tool, so maybe this is just setting up logging files.\n\nLooking at the repeated \"Process accessed\" events from Update.exe. Accessing processes multiple times without clear context could be a sign of something monitoring or interacting with other processes abnormally. \n\nThere's also an image load event for mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are related to .NET runtime. These are legitimate system files, so that doesn't raise red flags on its own.\n\nAnother point is the creation of Discord.exe shortcut using Update.exe. That seems like part of normal setup for Discord but could be a point of interest if it's done in an unusual way.\n\nThe command line arguments for Discord.exe are extensive and typical for Discord processes, including GPU-related options and various features being disabled. This doesn't seem suspicious at first glance.\n\nHowever, the combination of multiple file creations, process accesses, and image loads by Update.exe could indicate some form of lateral movement or data gathering. The repeated access to other processes might be a sign of a potential malicious activity trying to interact with legitimate services.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's enough unusual behavior to warrant further investigation. While individual events may not be suspicious, the overall pattern suggests possible malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creations and file activities related to Update.exe and Discord suggest potential malicious behavior or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving Discord.exe. It starts with Discord launching as a utility process and then loads various DLLs like ffmpeg.dll, d3dcompiler_47.dll, etc. These seem normal for Discord since it's a gaming and communication app that often uses such libraries for performance optimizations.\n\nNext, I notice several FileCreate tasks by Update.exe creating .lnk files on the desktop and in the Start Menu. This is a bit unusual because Update.exe isn't typically associated with Discord; usually, Discord handles updates through its own update mechanism. The creation of multiple shortcuts could be part of a setup routine or might indicate an attempt to create persistence points.\n\nThen there are ProcessAccess events for both Update.exe and Discord.exe. These accesses don't seem malicious on their own but could be part of legitimate operations. However, the frequency of these access events is something to note—three in a row for each process might be excessive unless it's part of an automated update process.\n\nThe key red flag comes from the use of reg.exe to modify the Windows Registry. Specifically, it adds entries to HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run and to the Classes\\Discord. The first registry change sets Discord to start on login via Update.exe, which is unusual because Discord typically starts through its own executable. The second registry edit adds a URL handler for \"URL:Discord Protocol,\" which could be legitimate but might also indicate an attempt to create persistence or manipulate how the system handles Discord links.\n\nConsidering all these together—unusual file creation by Update.exe, multiple process accesses, and registry modifications—it looks like there's some activity that goes beyond normal Discord operations. These actions could be part of a malicious script trying to establish persistence or alter system behavior in a way that's not standard for Discord itself.\n\nTherefore, while individual events might not be alarming, the combination suggests potential malicious activity, making the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creations and file modifications by Update.exe, along with registry changes via reg.exe, indicate potentially malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of log entries from what seems like Discord-related processes on a Windows system.\n\nFirst, there are multiple \"Pipe Created\" events for Discord.exe. I know that pipes can be used for inter-process communication, so these could just be normal operations, especially since Discord is a chat app that might need to communicate with other instances or services.\n\nThen, there's an event where reg.exe is used to add a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. That looks like it's setting up Discord as a shell open handler for URLs. I've seen legitimate software do this to handle their own protocols, so that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are several \"Process Create\" events for Discord.exe with different command lines. Looking at the command lines, they have various parameters like --type=gpu-process, --utility-sub-type=network.mojom.NetworkService, and others. These seem to be standard ways that Electron-based apps (like Discord) spawn different types of processes for GPU acceleration, network services, etc. So these are likely normal.\n\nThere's also an event where Update.exe creates a shortcut on the Desktop: \"Discord.lnk\". This could be part of an update process or a legitimate action to create a desktop shortcut for easy access. Since it's coming from an update-related process, that makes sense and isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nI'm noticing multiple instances of different types of processes being created by Discord.exe, each with specific command-line arguments. These are typical behaviors for multi-threaded or service-heavy applications. The file creation event for the .lnk file is also something a legitimate updater would do to maintain shortcuts.\n\nThe image load events for .exe and .dll files are standard when an application starts up. No anomalies there, as these are expected during the process initialization.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes starting with different types, some file operations like creating a shortcut, registry modifications for protocol handling—none of these individually or collectively seem out of place for Discord's normal operation. There's no indication of unusual access patterns, failed attempts, or writes to unexpected locations. The events are consistent with how an application like Discord would behave during startup and operation.\n\nTherefore, I don't see any red flags that would suggest this batch is indicative of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal process creations, inter-process communication, and file operations typical for Discord's startup and operation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events from a cybersecurity perspective. Each event is in JSONL format, and they all seem to involve the Discord.exe process or related activities. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding each individual event. The first few entries are about \"Process accessed\" tasks with the rule ProcessAccess. That's a bit generic but could indicate some activity around the Discord process. Then there's a Pipe Created event, which usually relates to inter-process communication—maybe Discord is using pipes for some internal operations.\n\nNext, I notice events where reg.exe is being used with command lines that modify the Windows registry. Specifically, they're adding entries under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord and its subkeys like \"URL Protocol\" and \"DefaultIcon\". This seems suspicious because modifying the registry can allow programs to hook into system processes or protocols. For example, Discord typically registers itself as a protocol handler so that clicking on a Discord link opens the app, but doing this through reg.exe might be unusual if it's automated or part of a larger process.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where reg.exe is used with different command lines to add various registry keys. Each time, the task is \"Process Create\". This could indicate that an external script or another program is invoking reg.exe to make these changes, which might be normal for Discord's setup but could also signal malicious activity like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there are several Process accessed and Pipe Created events related to Discord.exe itself. While Discord is a legitimate application, the frequency of these events—along with the registry modifications—could raise flags. If an attacker is trying to inject code or create backdoors, they might use such techniques to maintain persistence across reboots.\n\nI also see that some events include command lines for Discord.exe with specific arguments like \"--type=renderer\" and various options related to security features like --no-sandbox and --disable-background-timer-throttling. While these flags are common in Chromium-based apps, their presence alongside the registry changes might suggest an attempt to modify how Discord runs, possibly to bypass certain security restrictions.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows a series of events that could be part of legitimate Discord operations but also have red flags. The repeated use of reg.exe to modify the registry could indicate tampering or installation of malicious software. Additionally, the combination of process creation and modification of system settings might be part of a broader attack vector.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while some events are normal for Discord, the pattern of registry modifications is concerning. The confidence isn't super high (maybe 0.7) because it's possible that these actions are part of an update or legitimate script, but they do show behaviors that merit closer inspection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple registry modifications using reg.exe to set Discord protocol handlers and default icons. This could indicate malicious activity attempting to register Discord as a protocol handler or modify its execution behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of four events related to Discord.exe. The first event shows Discord starting with some command-line arguments that seem standard for its operation—things like language settings and service parameters. No red flags there.\n\nThe second event mentions a file executable detected in the same process. It points to Google.Widevine.CDM.dll, which I recall is commonly used for digital rights management, especially related to video streaming. Since Discord uses this for media playback, it makes sense that this file would be involved when someone streams or plays videos.\n\nThe next two events are about network connections detected in the process. Again, Discord being a communication platform, it's normal for it to make several network connections to handle messaging and data transfer.\n\nPutting it all together, these actions seem typical of Discord's operation—launching, dealing with media files, and communicating over the internet. There's nothing here that stands out as unusual or indicative of malicious activity. The processes and file interactions are consistent with how Discord is expected to behave when running.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal Discord operations including launch, file handling, and network connections, which do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
