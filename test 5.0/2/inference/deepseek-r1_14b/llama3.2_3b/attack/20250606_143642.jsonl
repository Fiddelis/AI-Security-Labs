All the entries have the same process name, \"Dism.exe\", which I know is related to Windows deployment services. Each event mentions a file being detected as executable, and all the files are located in temporary directories under different language folders like en-US.\n\nHmm, DismHost.exe is an executable that's part of DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management), used for servicing Windows images. The other files with extensions like .mui are usually resource files for localization, so they're not executables but just data files.\n\nThe repeated detection of these files might seem suspicious at first glance because each file triggers the FileExecutableDetected task. However, since all events come from the same process and point to known legitimate files used by DISM during installation or servicing operations, it's more likely normal activity rather than malicious behavior.\n\nI don't see any indicators of compromise here, like unusual paths, multiple failed attempts, or deviations from typical usage patterns. The consistent naming and structure of the file paths also support that these are standard actions taken by Dism.exe as part of its normal operation.\n\nSo overall, while it's good to monitor such events, in this case, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file operations performed by Dism.exe as part of its normal functionality.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, looking at the JSONL data provided, each line represents an event with process details, Windows log info, and file information.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are related to PowerShell.exe. There's one event where PowerShell is being executed with a command that checks for specific .inf files in the Windows directory. That might be normal admin activity, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell for scripting. Also, there are multiple ImageLoad and FileCreate tasks from PowerShell, which could indicate it's loading various modules or creating temporary files.\n\nThen, towards the end, there's a cmd.exe command that runs Dism.exe with parameters to disable Windows Defender. That stands out because disabling antivirus can be a red flag—it's often part of malicious activities to avoid detection. But sometimes admins might do this for legitimate reasons too.\n\nLooking further, after the cmd.exe event, there are several FileExecutableDetected events from Dism.exe, loading various DLLs, and creating files in a temporary directory. This could be normal if it's part of system updates or repairs, but combined with disabling Defender, it raises suspicion.\n\nI also notice that all these events are happening around the same time. The combination of PowerShell activity, disabling antivirus, and Dism operations makes me think this might be someone trying to modify system configurations or possibly deploying malicious software. However, without more context, like timestamps indicating unusual hours or repeated failed attempts, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the batch shows behavior that could indicate potential malicious activity but isn't conclusive on its own.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with commands checking system files and disabling antivirus, along with Dism operations creating temporary files.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. There are multiple JSON objects here, each representing an event. My goal is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, let me parse through each event to understand what's happening. \n\nLooking at the first few events, they all have \"process\": {\"name\": \"DismHost.exe\"}, and the winlog task is \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\". The file paths are pointing to various .dll files in a temporary directory under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. So, DismHost.exe is loading several DLLs. This seems normal because DismHost.exe is part of the Windows Deployment Services and is used for tasks like servicing the image during OS deployment.\n\nThen there's an event where \"DismHost.exe\" process terminates: {\"task\": \"Process terminated (rule: ProcessTerminate)\"}. That also sounds normal as part of the expected lifecycle.\n\nAfter that, events start showing \"process\": {\"name\": \"Dism.exe\"} with tasks like \"File Delete logged\". The files being deleted are again in the same temporary directory and include various .dll files. Additionally, there's a change in file creation time for DismHost.exe and another deletion of DismHost.exe itself.\n\nI need to consider if these actions are normal or indicative of malicious behavior. Since Dism.exe is part of the same suite as DismHost.exe, it makes sense that they would be interacting with each other, especially during an OS deployment or servicing operation. The loading and unloading of DLLs, along with file deletions in a temporary directory, are typical activities for such tools.\n\nHowever, I should check if these events are happening outside the expected context. For example, if this occurred during an actual deployment process, it would be normal. If there's no ongoing deployment and these processes are running without cause, that could be suspicious. But based solely on the information here, without additional context about the system's current activity or other indicators of compromise, I can't definitively say it's malicious.\n\nThe temporary directory path is also something to note. Temporary directories are common places for such operations, and seeing files created and deleted there isn't unusual unless there's an irregularity in how they're being handled.\n\nI should also consider the frequency of these events. If multiple DLLs are loaded and then quickly deleted, it might raise a flag, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. Since all these events seem related to Dism processes, which are legitimate, I'm leaning towards this not being an immediate cause for concern.\n\nBut wait, could there be something else? Maybe the specific DLLs loaded have malicious content. For example, if a known malicious file is loaded under a legitimate-sounding name, that would be concerning. However, in these events, each DLL has a provider suffix like \"IntlProvider\", \"DmiProvider\", etc., which align with standard Dism operations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the actions described could potentially be malicious, without additional context or indicators of compromise, they appear to be part of normal system processes related to deployment services. Therefore, I would classify this batch as not interesting for further investigation unless there's more evidence suggesting otherwise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are part of normal DismHost.exe and Dism.exe operations, loading and unloading DLLs in a temporary directory, which is typical during OS deployment or servicing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events provided in JSONL format. Each line is an individual event, and I need to analyze the entire batch as a whole to determine if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events are related to processes involving Dism.exe and DismHost.exe. The majority of these logs show \"File Executable Detected\" tasks associated with various DLL files in temporary directories. These include files like FolderProvider.dll, IBSProvider.dll, and others. This suggests that multiple dynamic link libraries are being loaded by the Dism process.\n\nLooking further, there's a transition from Dism.exe to DismHost.exe. One event shows DismHost.exe being created with a specific command line argument involving a GUID: {3ED660F2-D9DD-43D4-B3AD-3464234FFF3A}. This is unusual because it's not a typical process creation; the presence of a GUID might indicate some form of unique instantiation or communication between processes.\n\nThe subsequent events after DismHost.exe starts show various DLLs being loaded again, including OSProvider.dll and LogProvider.dll. Some of these DLLs were already detected by Dism.exe, which raises questions about their necessity in the process flow. The repeated loading could be a red flag for potential malicious activity, such as multiple components being deployed or executed.\n\nI also consider that Dism.exe (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) is typically used for servicing Windows images and isn't commonly associated with userland processes unless something is explicitly invoking it. If this process is running outside of standard servicing scenarios, especially in combination with the creation of a new process (DismHost.exe), it could indicate tampering or unauthorized access.\n\nThe temporary directory path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\" stands out because it's a common location for malicious software to drop files. The fact that multiple DLLs are being created and loaded from this directory adds to the suspicion of potential malware activity, such as file injection or process hollowing.\n\nFurthermore, the use of DismHost.exe is something I need to verify. I recall that DismHost is a legitimate Windows executable used in conjunction with DISM for servicing operations, but its execution under these conditions could be out of place. If DismHost is running with elevated privileges and loading multiple DLLs from an unusual location, it might be part of a broader attack vector.\n\nI also note the command line parameter passed to DismHost.exe includes a GUID. This could be a unique identifier for some operation or session, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is normal behavior. In some cases, GUIDs are used in legitimate operations, but they can also be part of exploit techniques.\n\nAnother point of consideration is the frequency and combination of events. The batch shows multiple instances of file executables detected and image loads from the same temporary directory. Such a pattern could be indicative of a loader or a dropper that's deploying several components as part of its payload.\n\nIn summary, while some activities involving DISM might be legitimate, especially in servicing scenarios, the combination here—executing Dism.exe leading to DismHost.exe and multiple DLL loads from a temporary directory—is concerning. The temporary location and the sequence of events point towards potential malicious behavior that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of file executables detected and image loads by DismHost.exe, along with creation of a unique process GUID, suggest potential malicious activity or unusual system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, I've got a batch of 14 JSONL events here. Each event has three main parts: process info, winlog data, and file details.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, each event shows that Dism.exe is the process name. That's interesting because I know Dism.exe is related to the Windows Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool. It's usually used for managing image files and system deployments, so it's a legitimate Windows process.\n\nThe winlog field in each event mentions \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\". This indicates that a file was deleted and this action was logged by some monitoring rule. So, the system detected a file deletion, which is why it's showing up here.\n\nNow, looking at the files being deleted. The paths are all under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with varying GUID-like folder names like 33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89. The files have names like GenericProvider.dll.mui, IBSProvider.dll.mui, and so on. These seem to be DLLs and MUI (multi-language interface) files. \n\nSince Dism.exe is involved in servicing and managing system images, it's common for it to create temporary files during operations like installing updates or servicing an image. After the operation is done, these temporary files are usually cleaned up by deleting them. So, seeing multiple file deletions from a temp directory by Dism.exe doesn't immediately raise red flags.\n\nEach event shows that Dism.exe deleted one of these files. The repetition makes me think this might be part of a normal servicing process where several files were created and then removed after use. I don't see any unusual patterns here, like an excessive number of deletions beyond what's typical for such operations.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that Dism.exe could be used maliciously, but in this case, all events are consistent with legitimate activity. The same process name is repeated, and all file paths lead to a standard temp directory structure expected from Dism operations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events likely represent normal file deletion activities during the servicing of a system image by Dism.exe. There's no evidence of unusual behavior or signs of malicious intent in the data provided.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file deletions by Dism.exe during system servicing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. \n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve powershell.exe processes with specific command lines. The first event shows a PowerShell command that writes \"Final result: 1\" to the host. This seems normal as it's a basic output command.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where the command line is more complex. These commands are checking for specific patterns in INF files located in the Windows directory. The script iterates through each .inf file and looks for lines matching certain keywords related to installation sections. If found, it sets $Res to 1 and exits.\n\nThe fact that these scripts are run multiple times with similar command lines might indicate testing or repeated checks on system configurations. However, without evidence of unusual behavior like access to sensitive files, network connections, or privilege escalation, the activity doesn't appear malicious. The use of \"-ExecutionPolicy Restricted\" also suggests some level of security, as it limits script execution.\n\nThe log events don't show any signs of writing to unexpected locations, downloading files, or other red flags typically associated with malware. While PowerShell is often used for attacks, these commands seem benign and could be part of legitimate system checks or administrative tasks.\n\nGiven the repetitive nature and lack of malicious indicators, I classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated execution of PowerShell commands that check for specific patterns in INF files but do not exhibit signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. All the events involve PowerShell commands. The first two entries are using a more complex command-line that checks INF files in the Windows directory for specific patterns. This could be malicious because it's accessing system files and looking for certain configurations.\n\nThen, there are eight other events where PowerShell is removing files from the Temp folder. Specifically, they're targeting *.entrada_principal.zip files. The use of wildcards might indicate an attempt to delete multiple files, which could be part of a cleanup routine by malware to remove traces of itself or other malicious activities.\n\nI notice that some events have different 'task' values in winlog, like 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle'. This variation might suggest the script is running across different components or services, possibly indicating a broader lateral movement or an attempt to execute code at various levels within the system.\n\nThe combination of these actions—accessing system files and deleting temporary files—raises red flags. Malicious actors often use PowerShell for its scripting capabilities and to avoid detection. The repeated attempts to remove specific files could be part of an exfiltration or deletion process after compromising a system.\n\nGiven the potential for these activities to indicate malicious behavior, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING. However, there's some uncertainty because sometimes scripts can have legitimate purposes, like cleanup tasks. The confidence is around 0.8 because while not definitive, the pattern of repeated and potentially harmful actions strongly suggests investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell commands showing patterns indicative of potential malicious activity, such as accessing system files and deleting temporary files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out what's going on here. I'm looking at these logs and trying to make sense of them step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that there are events involving 'powershell.exe'. That's interesting because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. So, I need to pay attention to the specific actions it's performing.\n\nThe first event shows 'powershell.exe' accessing a file in the Windows Defender directory. The path is long and includes \"MpOAV.dll\". I'm not entirely sure what this means, but accessing such files could be part of normal operations or might indicate something suspicious.\n\nNext, there's an event where a script named '__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1' is created in the Temp directory. This looks like it's related to PowerShell scripting policy testing. I'm wondering if this is a legitimate check by Windows or part of some malicious activity trying to bypass policies.\n\nThen, the same script is deleted shortly after being created. That's a bit concerning because creating and immediately deleting files can be a tactic used in malware to avoid detection. It makes me think that maybe someone is testing the system's response or trying to hide their tracks.\n\nLooking further, there are pipe creations by 'powershell.exe'. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication. This could be normal, especially if PowerShell is running scripts that need to communicate with other processes. However, it's another point of interest because attackers might use pipes for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the deletion of a file named '*entrada_principal.zip' in the Temp directory using a PowerShell command. This seems like an attempt to remove files from the system, possibly to clean up after some activity. The use of wildcards suggests that multiple files might be deleted, which could be part of a larger script.\n\nThe event where 'powershell.exe' loads image files from the Windows Defender directory again makes me think about potential tampering with security tools. If an attacker can load malicious code into a legitimate process like Defender's, it could go undetected for longer.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility of these events being part of a larger campaign or script execution. The repeated use of PowerShell and the specific file operations suggest that someone is running automated tasks on the system. This could be a red flag if not properly authorized.\n\nI wonder about the user account under which these processes are running. If this activity is happening without proper user consent, it could indicate unauthorized access. Additionally, checking the timestamps of these events might provide more context—like whether they're spread out over time or happening in quick succession.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the use of specific filenames and paths. The script '__PSScriptPolicyTest...' seems related to PowerShell's own policy testing, which makes me question if this is a legitimate check or if it's being exploited for malicious purposes.\n\nI should also think about how these events fit together. For example, creating a script, deleting it, accessing security-related files, and using pipes—these could all be steps in an attack chain. Maybe the attacker is trying to establish persistence, drop malware components, or exfiltrate data.\n\nLastly, I'm considering whether there's evidence of known malware signatures or behaviors here. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but the pattern of behavior points towards potential malicious activity that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the logs, the observed activities indicate potential malicious behavior involving PowerShell and file operations in the Windows environment. Here is a structured summary:\n\n1. **Processes and Commands:**\n   - **powershell.exe** was executed multiple times with specific command lines, including attempts to remove files from the Temp directory and interact with system processes.\n\n2. **File Operations:**\n   - A script `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` was created in the Temp directory and immediately deleted. This behavior is suspicious as it suggests an attempt to hide or erase evidence.\n   - The command `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force` indicates deletion of files, possibly to clean up after malicious activities.\n\n3. **Registry and Image Activity:**\n   - PowerShell accessed a registry value and loaded images from the Windows Defender directory, which could indicate attempts to interfere with security mechanisms or load malicious components.\n\n4. **Inter-Process Communication:**\n   - Creation of pipes by `powershell.exe` suggests potential communication between processes, possibly for command and control or data transfer.\n\n5. **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - The repeated use of PowerShell to execute commands.\n   - Unusual file creation and deletion patterns in the Temp directory.\n   - Access to security-related system files and registry entries.\n\n6. **Recommendations:**\n   - Conduct a thorough investigation into these activities, checking for unauthorized access or malware.\n   - Review logs for timestamps and sequences to understand the activity flow.\n   - Consider running additional monitoring tools to detect any anomalies in future processes.\n\nIn conclusion, the observed behavior strongly suggests potential malicious activity leveraging PowerShell. Immediate action is recommended to secure the system and prevent further compromise."}
