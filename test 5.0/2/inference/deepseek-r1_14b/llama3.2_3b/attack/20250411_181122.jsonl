Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a PowerShell process that created a file in the StartupProfileData directory. That seems a bit odd because PowerShell scripts in such directories might be for persistence. Then there's another PowerShell command using findstr and select-string looking for passwords. That immediately raises red flags because it looks like password harvesting.\n\nLooking further, there are several Chrome.exe entries with DNS queries and registry changes. Those could just be normal browser activity, but the network connections to unknown domains (like 'detetive particulare123.com.br') might be suspicious. Also, Chrome accessing system files like amsi.dll isn't typical and could indicate malicious behavior.\n\nThere are multiple instances where winlogbeat.exe is creating files. This could be legitimate if it's part of the logging setup, but repeated writes to the same path might suggest something's off, especially if combined with other suspicious activities.\n\nThen there's 'whoami.exe' being run, which can be used to gather user information. That alone isn't bad, but when combined with other tools like schtasks and powershell, it might indicate privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n\nSeveral events show schtasks.exe deleting tasks. Task scheduling deletions could be part of a cleanup routine after malicious activities. Also, process creation events for cmd.exe with specific commands to delete scheduled tasks are concerning—they might be trying to remove traces of their actions.\n\nThere's also a PowerShell process accessing another file ('estrutura_ativo.txt'), which again could be storing data or configurations that aren't normal. And the repeated use of schtasks.exe without clear justification adds to the suspicion.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a mix of potentially malicious activities: password harvesting, system reconnaissance, task deletion, and persistence mechanisms. The combination suggests a possible attack chain where an adversary is trying to establish persistence, gather information, and cover their tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell commands attempting to harvest passwords, deletion of scheduled tasks, and unusual file creations which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm seeing a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event from the system logs.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they involve powershell.exe processes. The command line in some shows a script that uses findstr and select-string with patterns like \"pass\" and searching through various file types. That immediately raises a red flag because PowerShell scripts often used for malicious purposes, especially ones searching for sensitive information like passwords.\n\nAlso, there's a lot of repeated events where powershell.exe is accessing different files or modules. The fact that it's loading various .NET framework components could be normal, but the combination with the command-line arguments suggests something more nefarious.\n\nI notice there's a file created and then deleted in the same location: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. This temporary file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1. Temporary files are often used by malicious scripts to avoid detection, so this adds to the concern.\n\nAnother point is that there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being invoked with the same command line. Repeating the same command can be a tactic to avoid detection or to ensure persistence after some conditions are met. It might be part of an attempt to execute malicious code without getting caught in one go.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event involving calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. While calc is generally harmless, it's worth noting because sometimes malware uses legitimate processes to hide their activities. However, this single event doesn't seem as concerning on its own compared to the powershell activities.\n\nPutting all of this together, the repeated use of powershell with suspicious command-line arguments, the creation and deletion of a temporary script file, and the multiple file access events are strong indicators that this batch is indeed interesting for investigation. The confidence level is high because these behaviors are common in attack patterns, especially related to credential harvesting or other malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing suspicious commands searching for sensitive information, creating and deleting a temporary file, and loading various system components. These activities indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is something I should look into. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL entries, each line represents an event with process info, winlog task, and file path. The processes involved include schtasks.exe, whoami.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, WMIC.exe, net.exe, net1.exe, conhost.exe. \n\nI know that many of these are legitimate system tools, but they can also be used maliciously. For example, cmd.exe and powershell.exe are often used by attackers for command execution and script running. The use of 'wmic' with commands like deleting processes (notepad.exe) stands out because it's a technique I've heard is common in some malware to eliminate traces or other processes.\n\nThere's a series of process creations, especially cmd.exe and powershell.exe, which might be part of a script execution chain. The command lines have things like \"\/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\" — that definitely looks suspicious because it's deleting a process, possibly to cover tracks or disrupt the system.\n\nAlso, multiple instances of net.exe and cmd.exe being used with user deletion commands like \"net user \/del\" indicate attempts to remove user accounts. This could be an attempt at privilege escalation or system compromise, as attackers often try to clean up traces or create backdoor accounts.\n\nThe schtasks.exe event loading taskschd.dll is another red flag because it's related to scheduled tasks and can be used maliciously to maintain persistence.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a pattern of process creation, deletion of user accounts, and execution of potentially harmful commands. These activities don't seem to be normal user behavior; they look more like someone trying to gain unauthorized access or cause harm to the system.\n\nI'm pretty confident that this batch is interesting because it shows signs of malicious activity across multiple processes and command executions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activities such as process deletions, user account manipulations, and potential backdoor creations using tools like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, WMIC.exe, and net.exe. These actions may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this cybersecurity analysis. I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **cmd.exe** setting a registry value: cmd.exe is commonly used, so this could be normal.\n2. **sc.exe delete win32times**: This command deletes a service. Not inherently suspicious unless it's part of malicious activity.\n3. **services.exe** modifying the registry: Services.exe is part of Windows, so this is routine.\n4. **whoami.exe** running without arguments: Whoami is usually benign, but if used with certain commands, could be malicious. Here, it seems standard.\n5. **powershell.exe** setting a registry value: PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers, but not always bad on its own.\n6. **cmd.exe deleting files in Temp**: Deleting files from the Temp directory can be part of cleanup routines, maybe by malware to cover tracks.\n7. **File Delete logged for tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe**: This file deletion is noted, which could indicate something was removed intentionally.\n8. **conhost.exe** modifying registry: Conhost is a Windows process; this might not be suspicious on its own.\n9. **powershell.exe accessed and created**: Multiple entries show PowerShell being launched, which raises an eyebrow given its common use in attacks.\n10. **Multiple Provider Lifecycle events for powershell.exe**: This seems repetitive and possibly part of malicious scripting or legitimate usage.\n11. **Image loads in PowerShell pointing to various DLLs**: Loading these is normal for PowerShell's operation but could mask malicious activities.\n12. **File Delete logged for __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1**: Deleting a PowerShell script file suggests something was removed, possibly to avoid detection.\n13. **Pipe Created in PowerShell**: Pipes can be used for communication between processes; sometimes used by malware.\n14. **conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe modifying registry**: These are legitimate Windows processes, so this might not be suspicious.\n15. **calc.exe loading urlmon.dll**: Calc is a simple app, but loading URL-related DLLs could hint at something unusual.\n\nLooking at the batch as a whole, there's a notable number of PowerShell activities and deletions in the Temp directory. The repeated use of cmd.exe deleting files and the multiple Provider Lifecycle events for PowerShell are red flags. These behaviors can be indicative of malicious scripts trying to clean up after themselves or establish persistence.\n\nThe confidence is high because while individual actions could be benign, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. The repetitive nature and multiple deletions in sensitive areas like Temp directory add to the suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry modifications, file deletions from temporary directories, and suspicious process creations suggest potential malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: A process named Calculator.exe was involved in an ImageLoad task. That seems normal because Calculator is a standard Windows application. It loads the urlmon.dll file, which I know is part of Windows for handling URLs. So nothing suspicious here.\n\nSecond event: winlogbeat.exe created a new file. Winlogbeat is likely related to log management or shipping tools like Elasticsearch. Creating a configuration file makes sense during setup or updates. No red flags.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe accessed something via ProcessAccess. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be tricky. But without more context, it's hard to say if this access was malicious. Maybe just running some script?\n\nFourth event: whoami.exe was executed with the command line pointing to its standard path. Whoami is a common tool to check user information. It's typically used by users or scripts for legitimate purposes, so unless there's an unusual time or location, it doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nFifth and sixth events: chrome.exe made DNS queries. Browsers do this all the time when navigating to websites, so nothing unusual here.\n\nSeventh event: chrome.exe established a network connection. Again, standard behavior for any web browser accessing the internet.\n\nPutting it all together, I don't see any activities that stand out as malicious or concerning. Each process is doing something normal within its expected operations. There's no indication of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events are normal and non-suspicious activities such as calculator execution, file creation by winlogbeat, process access by powershell (could be legitimate), whoami execution, and browser activity which is expected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
