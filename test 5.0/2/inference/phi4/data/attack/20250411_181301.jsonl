{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181301.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe could indicate unauthorized or malicious activity, especially when combined with a file creation event by powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Frequent Registry Modifications by `chrome.exe`:** The process `chrome.exe` appears numerous times in the log with the task of setting registry values (`RegistryEvent`). Such repeated modifications can be indicative of an attempt to alter system settings or install malware, especially if these changes are not initiated by legitimate software updates or user actions.\n\n2. **Suspicious File Creation Events:**\n   - `powershell.exe` creating a file named `registro_auxiliar.txt` could potentially indicate data extraction or preparation for further malicious activity.\n   - The creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` by `winlogbeat.exe` in the Downloads folder is unusual, as configuration files are typically updated directly rather than having new versions created.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Analysis:** Individually, these events might be benign; however, when combined, they raise concerns about possible unauthorized access or manipulation of system settings and data exfiltration attempts, warranting further investigation. This pattern warrants an \"INTERESTING\" classification due to the potential for malicious activity. The confidence level is high but not absolute, reflecting the typical uncertainty in assessing log entries without additional context."}
