{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events by chrome.exe suggest potential misuse or exploitation. Additionally, unusual processes like powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files are suspicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Registry Modifications**: The repetitive setting of registry values by `chrome.exe` is concerning as legitimate browser activity typically does not involve extensive changes to the system's registry. This pattern could indicate an attempt to alter system behavior or persistence mechanisms.\n\n2. **Image Loading Events**: The loading of `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` by `chrome.exe` might be indicative of attempts to evade antivirus detection, as these files are part of Windows Defender's antimalware scanning infrastructure. Malicious actors often try to disable or bypass these defenses.\n\n3. **Suspicious Processes**:\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` and `powershell.exe` creating files can be legitimate but also raise suspicion depending on context. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities.\n   - The specific file paths and names (e.g., `.winlogbeat.yml.new`, `componente_secundario.txt`) should be scrutinized further, as they might not follow typical usage patterns.\n\nGiven these observations, the batch of events warrants further investigation to determine if there is a security threat. The confidence level reflects reasonable suspicion based on known indicators of compromise and typical attack vectors."}
