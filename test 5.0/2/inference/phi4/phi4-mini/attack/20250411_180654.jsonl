The script runs several times in different directories, logs keystrokes to a temporary file (key.log), and is executed from different command lines using various obfuscation techniques. Additionally, there are repeated registry value changes by Chrome.exe, suggesting possible manipulation for persistence or privilege escalation. These combined indicators suggest malicious behavior worthy of further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
