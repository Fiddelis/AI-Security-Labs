This could be benign but requires attention if it's not a recognized application from Microsoft Office or other trusted sources.\n\n2. **File Paths and Names:** All files are located in the same directory under `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages`, indicating they're related to some Office package solution. The consistent naming pattern (`officeaicopilot-strings.min`) suggests a bulk operation, possibly automated.\n\n3. **File Hashes:** Multiple files have the same hash value (`6c878e617b5cdf6ec02250c4701fa7ea.js` and `6f9b8b3b4869f511c67390730eeabfbb.js`). Identical file contents with different names could indicate a replication or misconfiguration, which might be suspicious if not expected.\n\n4. **Volume of Events:** There are numerous events (12 in total) within a short timeframe related to the same process and directory. Such volume can suggest automated activity, which may be benign (like an update script) but potentially malicious if unauthorized.\n\nThe combination of these factors makes this batch of logs interesting for further investigation into whether `SDXHelper.exe` is performing legitimate operations or if it's involved in unwanted behavior on the system."}
