This pattern often suggests an attempt to obfuscate malicious activity. The presence of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` involved in creating these tasks, along with the creation of a task file at `C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\Tasks\\\\win32times`, further supports suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
