{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The log entries you've provided are indicative of various system and process activities, some of which may be benign while others could suggest malicious behavior. Here's a brief analysis:\n\n1. **`Dism.exe` Entries**: These logs show that the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool is used for operations like extracting files to an image or removing components from a Windows image. This could be part of routine maintenance or updates.\n\n2. **`Powershell.exe` Activity**: PowerShell is commonly used for automation tasks in Windows environments, but it can also be exploited by attackers to execute malicious scripts. The logs show various activities:\n   - Creation and deletion of files in the temporary directory.\n   - Accessing a PowerShell script that could potentially alter or bypass security settings (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`).\n   - Loading images such as `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`, which is standard for executing PowerShell scripts.\n\n3. **Registry Events**: The activity involving the registry, especially setting values using PowerShell, can be a sign of an attempt to modify system configurations or hide malicious processes.\n\n4. **Process Creation and Access**: Multiple entries related to process creation (`powershell.exe`) and access suggest that this script might be executing several tasks sequentially, which could include disabling security features or preparing the environment for further actions.\n\n5. **Image Loading**: The loading of images like `MpOAV.dll` (related to Windows Defender) suggests that there may be an interaction with system protection components, potentially trying to evade detection.\n\n6. **Pipe Creation Event**: This event might indicate inter-process communication which could be used for data exfiltration or coordination between malicious processes.\n\n**Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n\n- Frequent file creation and deletion in the Temp directory.\n- Use of PowerShell with suspicious scripts (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`).\n- Registry manipulation via scripts.\n- Interaction with Windows Defender components, which might suggest evasion attempts.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- **Review PowerShell Logs**: Check for any unauthorized or unusual scripts executed by PowerShell. Ensure that script execution policies are appropriately configured to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.\n  \n- **Monitor and Investigate Processes**: Use tools like Process Monitor to see what exactly these processes are doing, including network activity.\n\n- **Audit Registry Changes**: Examine the registry entries modified during this period for any unauthorized changes.\n\n- **Enhance Security Measures**: Ensure that Windows Defender or other endpoint protection solutions are up-to-date with the latest signatures and heuristics. Consider enabling advanced threat protection features.\n\n- **Conduct a Full System Scan**: Use reputable antivirus\/malware detection tools to scan your system for potential threats.\n\nThese steps can help determine whether these activities are benign administrative tasks or part of a malicious campaign targeting your system."}
