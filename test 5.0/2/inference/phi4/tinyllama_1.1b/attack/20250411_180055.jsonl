Additionally, there are several registry modifications by various processes including 'RuntimeBroker.exe', 'svchost.exe', 'chrome.exe', and another instance of 'powershell.exe'. Registry changes often indicate attempts at persistence or configuration alteration. The creation of the file 'winlogbeat.yml.new' might suggest tampering with logging tools. Combined, these events suggest potential unauthorized actions that merit further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
