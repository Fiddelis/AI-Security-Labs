The use of certutil.exe to encode and execute a file, along with the creation of an executable via this utility, indicates possible malware activity. Additionally, PowerShell access and rundll32.exe running from the system32 directory further raise suspicion. The involvement of chrome.exe in multiple registry changes and network connections could imply a compromised or manipulated browser environment. These combined factors warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
