{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of the events:\n\n1. **Initial PowerShell Process Creation**\n   - A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) was created.\n\n2. **Registry Value Set**\n   - A registry value was set (rule: RegistryEvent).\n\n3. **PowerShell Script Execution**\n   - Another PowerShell process was created, running the command `\\\"powershell.exe\\\" & {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}`.\n     - This suggests that a script or command is attempting to delete files in the Temp directory.\n\n4. **Process Access and Image Load Events**\n   - Several process access events occurred, indicating interactions with other processes.\n   - Two image load events happened:\n     - `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`: This is related to PowerShell itself.\n     - `MpOAV.dll`: This is a component of Microsoft Defender Antivirus.\n\n5. **File Creation and Deletion**\n   - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) was created in the Temp directory, then immediately deleted.\n   - Another file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) was created in the PowerShell directory.\n\n6. **Pipe Creation**\n   - A pipe was created (rule: PipeEvent).\n\nThese events suggest that an attacker is attempting to execute a script or command via PowerShell, potentially to delete files related to `entrada_principal.zip` in the Temp directory. The script they're using (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) was created and then deleted, which could indicate an attempt to hide their activity.\n\nTo investigate further:\n\n- Check for any unusual files or changes in the Temp directory.\n- Look into recent registry modifications for anything suspicious.\n- Review PowerShell event logs for additional related events.\n- Consider applying security measures such as restricting script execution or implementing AppLocker policies."}
