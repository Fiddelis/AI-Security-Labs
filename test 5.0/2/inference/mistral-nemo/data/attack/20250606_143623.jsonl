{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided JSON logs, here's a summarized timeline of events:\n\n1. **Initial Process and Windows Logon:**\n   - `explorer.exe` process started.\n   - Windows logon event for user 'USERNAME'.\n   - `svchost.exe`, `services.exe`, and `sppsvc.exe` processes started.\n   - Several unknown processes started (no associated events).\n\n2. **File Operations:**\n   - `taskschd.dll` file loaded by `sppsvc.exe`.\n   - No other notable file operations observed.\n\n3. **PowerShell Service Creation:**\n   - A PowerShell script creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with the binary path set to `\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"`.\n   - The script attempts to start the newly created service.\n\n4. **Windows Update Agent:**\n   - Windows Update Agent event occurred, but no associated process or file operation was logged.\n\n5. **Unknown Processes and Events:**\n   - Multiple unknown processes started with no associated events or files.\n\n6. **Later Event:**\n   - An `Engine Lifecycle` event occurred, but no associated process or file operation was logged.\n\n**Note:** Most of the logs are related to unknown processes and events without any associated file operations, making it difficult to draw significant conclusions about suspicious activities.\n\nTo gain more insights into potential threats, you might want to enable deeper logging (e.g., ETW tracing) and analyze more specific events like network connections or command-line arguments for the processes involved. Additionally, investigating the `tarefa_logico.exe` file could provide more information about its purpose and whether it poses a risk.\n\nAs always, it's essential to correlate these logs with other security tools and techniques to get a complete picture of your system's security posture."}
