{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"This output appears to be a log of Windows events collected by Winlogbeat, a tool for collecting and forwarding Windows event logs. The log contains a series of events, each represented as a JSON object with various fields.\n\nHere's an example of what the structure of one of these events looks like:\n```\n{\n  \"process\": {\n    \"name\": \"chrome.exe\"\n  },\n  \"winlog\": {\n    \"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"\n  },\n  \"file\": null\n}\n```\nEach event has three main sections:\n\n1. `process`: This section contains information about the process that generated the event, such as its name.\n2. `winlog`: This section contains information about the Windows event itself, including the task type (e.g., \"Registry value set\") and the rule that triggered the event (e.g., \"RegistryEvent\").\n3. `file`: This section may contain information about a file related to the event, such as its path.\n\nSome common tasks you'll see in this log include:\n\n* `Process Create`: A new process was created.\n* `File Created`: A new file was created.\n* `Image Loaded`: An executable image was loaded into memory.\n* `Registry Value Set`: A registry value was set or modified.\n* `Dns Query`: A DNS query was made.\n\nYou can use this log to analyze and visualize Windows events on your system, such as identifying which processes are creating files, setting registry values, or making DNS queries."}
