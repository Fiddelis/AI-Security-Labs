The first one is about 'whoami.exe' being created, which is a normal Windows process that displays user information. The second entry is about 'powershell.exe' being accessed. Both processes are legitimate, but I need to check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nWhoami.exe is typically used to show the current user's identity. It's a standard command, so unless it's being used in an unusual context, it's probably benign. The second event mentions 'powershell.exe' with a ProcessAccess rule. PowerShell is a common tool, but it's also frequently abused by attackers for malicious activities. However, just accessing PowerShell isn't necessarily bad. The key is whether there are other indicators, like unexpected command lines, unusual parent processes, or multiple such events in a short time.\n\nLooking at the provided data, there's no additional context. The command line for whoami is standard, and the PowerShell entry only mentions access, not execution or specific commands. Without more information, like unexpected parameters, network activity, or other related events, these might just be normal system activities. \n\nThe classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The confidence is around 0.6 because while the processes are legitimate, the presence of PowerShell access could be a red flag in some contexts, but without more data, it's not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard process creation\/access for legitimate Windows tools (whoami.exe and powershell.exe). No suspicious command-line arguments, unusual process tree, or other indicators of compromise are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this batch of events. First, I need to look for any suspicious activities. The first event shows a process creating a scheduled task with cmd.exe and powershell.exe, trying to run a script that doesn't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1). That's a red flag because creating a scheduled task under the system account with a non-existent script might be an attempt to execute malicious code later.\n\nThen, there's another event where schtasks.exe is used again to create a task with similar parameters. The command line includes \"-ep bypass\" which is often used to bypass execution policy restrictions in PowerShell, a common tactic in attacks. The script paths mentioned don't exist, which could indicate the attacker is trying to execute a script that's not present, possibly a setup for a future payload.\n\nLooking at other events, there are multiple registry value sets and file creations, but most of them seem normal, like Chrome and svchost.exe activities. However, the repeated use of schtasks.exe to create tasks with PowerShell commands that reference non-existent scripts is suspicious. Also, the fact that the tasks are set to run daily under the system account gives elevated privileges, which is concerning.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files might be normal if it's part of log collection, but the other PowerShell and schtasks activities are more indicative of potential malicious behavior. The justification would be the creation of scheduled tasks with non-existent scripts and the use of bypassed execution policies. Confidence is medium-high because while some events are benign, the combination of these specific activities points towards a possible attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple scheduled task creations with PowerShell commands referencing non-existent scripts (e.g., 'c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1'), combined with '-ep bypass' to bypass execution policies, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
