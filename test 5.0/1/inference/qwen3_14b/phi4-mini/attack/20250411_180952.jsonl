{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided three log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so it's normal for it to create configuration files. The path seems legitimate, and there's no obvious malicious activity here. Maybe just part of the software's setup.\n\nThe second event is powershell.exe setting a registry value. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Setting a registry value could be part of a script or a configuration change. But on its own, this isn't necessarily bad. However, it's something to note, especially if combined with other events.\n\nThe third event is another PowerShell process accessing a process. Process access can be normal, but it might also be part of something like process injection or monitoring. Again, without more context, it's hard to tell, but it's a red flag.\n\nNow, looking at all three together. The first event is benign, but the next two involve PowerShell doing registry changes and process access. If these events are part of a larger attack, maybe the PowerShell activities are part of a payload. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The user might be installing software, and these events are just part of the process. But the combination of registry changes and process access by PowerShell could indicate something more, especially if they're not typical for the user's environment. However, without more data, like unusual commands or unexpected network activity, it's hard to be certain. The confidence level is moderate. Maybe around 0.6. The justification would be that the PowerShell events are suspicious but not conclusive on their own, and the first event is normal. So the classification is interesting but not certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"PowerShell.exe performed registry modification and process access events, which are often associated with malicious activity. While the first event (winlogbeat.exe creating a config file) is benign, the combination of PowerShell actions may indicate potential reconnaissance or configuration changes by an attacker.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe doing DNS queries and MpDefenderCoreService.exe having network connections. Those are normal processes. Chrome.exe also doing DNS and network connections, which is typical for a browser. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed, which isn't unusual on its own.\n\nBut then I see 'whoami.exe' being executed. That's a standard command, but maybe not a red flag. The real issue comes later with cmd.exe running commands to add users and add them to the Domain Admins group. The command lines show adding users like \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with a password and adding them to Domain Admins. That's a big red flag because modifying domain admin groups is a high-privilege action and could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or gain unauthorized access.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' (which might be a typo or a malicious version) adding users and groups. The use of 'net1.exe' instead of the standard 'net.exe' is suspicious. Additionally, the 'cmd.exe' event where a registry value is set could be part of persistence mechanisms, like changing registry keys to maintain access.\n\nThere's also the creation of files like .winlogbeat.yml.new and pacote_base.txt. While file creation is normal, the context here might be more important. However, the main concern is the user and group modifications. These actions are typically seen in attacks where an attacker is trying to establish a foothold in the domain, which is a critical security issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the presence of commands adding domain admin users, using suspicious executables, and modifying registry settings points towards a potential security breach. The confidence is high because these are clear indicators of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Creation of domain admin users via 'net.exe'\/'net1.exe' with complex passwords. 2) Unusual process executions (cmd.exe, powershell.exe) modifying system configurations. 3) Potential privilege escalation attempts through user\/group modifications in a domain environment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
