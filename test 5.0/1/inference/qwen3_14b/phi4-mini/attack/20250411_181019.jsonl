{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are about process accesses, registry value sets, and process creations. There's a lot of PowerShell.exe and services.exe activity. Now, PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be a vector for malicious activities. However, just seeing PowerShell alone isn't enough to flag it as malicious.\n\nLooking closer, there's an entry with cmd.exe where the command line is \"sc create win32times binPath= \"cmd \/c start c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\" & sc qc win32times\". Wait, the script path is \"c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\". The name \"NonExistingScript.ps1\" suggests that the script might not be present, which could be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to create a service that runs a non-existent script, which could be a way to hide malicious activity or trigger an error. But then again, maybe it's a typo or a misconfigured script.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated registry value sets by services.exe and other processes. However, services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, so that might be normal. The same goes for svchost.exe and others. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory is normal for log collection, but the file name has a .new extension, which might be part of the normal operation.\n\nBut the key point here is the cmd.exe command trying to create a service with a non-existent script. That seems suspicious. Even though there's no direct evidence of malicious code, the attempt to create a service pointing to a non-existent script could indicate an attempt to execute a payload later or a misconfiguration. However, without more context, like the script actually being present or other malicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators. The other events are mostly normal process accesses and registry changes. The use of \"sc qc\" checks the service configuration, which is a legitimate command. But combining that with creating a service that points to a non-existent script might be a sign of something fishy.\n\nConsidering all this, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" because there's a potential suspicious activity with the service creation and non-existent script. However, the confidence isn't 100% because it could be a mistake or a misconfiguration. Maybe around 0.6 confidence. The justification would be the attempt to create a service with a non-existent script, which could be an indicator of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe events include suspicious registry modifications and service creation attempts. Notably, a cmd.exe process attempts to create a service (win32times) with a non-existent script path (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1), which may indicate malicious intent or misconfiguration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each line. The first five entries are all about chrome.exe with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and no file involved. That's a lot of registry changes by Chrome. But is that normal? Chrome does use the registry for various purposes, like storing settings or extensions. However, multiple registry changes might be a red flag if they're unexpected or part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen there's the sixth entry: chrome.exe loading amsi.dll from C:\\Windows\\System32\\. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If Chrome is loading this DLL, that's unusual. Normally, amsi.dll is loaded by the system or security software. But why would Chrome do that? Maybe it's a legitimate action, but it's worth checking. However, the path is correct, so maybe it's not malicious. But the fact that it's being loaded by Chrome could be suspicious.\n\nThe seventh entry is chrome.exe loading MpOAV.dll from the Windows Defender Platform. Again, this is a legitimate file, but again, being loaded by Chrome might be odd. Maybe Chrome is interacting with Defender, but is that normal? I'm not sure. It might be part of some security feature, but I need to think if this is common.\n\nThe eighth entry is about powershell.exe having a process accessed event. The file is None, so maybe it's about process access without a specific file. But the rule is ProcessAccess. That could be normal, like another process accessing PowerShell, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, if PowerShell is being accessed by other processes, that might not be suspicious unless there's other indicators.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple registry changes by Chrome, which could be normal, but then loading of amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll by Chrome. Those DLLs are part of Windows Defender. Could this be a legitimate interaction? Maybe Chrome is using Defender's APIs for scanning, but that's not common. Alternatively, it could be a sign of something malicious trying to hook into Defender's components.\n\nAlso, the repetition of the same events (multiple registry sets) might indicate a script or process that's making multiple changes. If this is part of a larger attack, like modifying the registry to persist or alter behavior, that's a concern. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being changed or other suspicious activities, it's a bit hard to tell.\n\nThe presence of PowerShell being accessed might be a red flag if it's part of a chain of events, but alone, it's not enough. The key points here are the unusual DLLs being loaded by Chrome and the repeated registry events. Since the user is asking for a classification based on the entire batch, I need to weigh these factors.\n\nConsidering that the registry changes are all from Chrome and the loading of Defender DLLs, this could be either benign or malicious. But the fact that Chrome is loading those DLLs is unusual and might be worth investigating. Therefore, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6, as there are suspicious elements but not conclusive evidence of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes triggering registry modifications and loading Windows Defender DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), which may indicate anomalous behavior or potential tampering with security mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
