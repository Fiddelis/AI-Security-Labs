{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is the use of 'sc.exe' commands to create a service called 'win32times' with a binPath that points to a PowerShell script. The command line arguments show that they're trying to start a script located at 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1' and another at 'c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1'. Both of these files are named as non-existing, which is a red flag. Typically, attackers might use such names to hide their activities or because the actual script is in a different location.\n\nThen there's the 'cmd.exe' process that's running a command to create the service and then query it. The fact that they're creating a service and immediately querying it could be part of an attempt to establish persistence on the system. Services are often used by malware to ensure they run even after reboots.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are several 'Registry value set' events, which might indicate changes to the registry for persistence or configuration changes. However, the presence of 'notepad.exe', 'calc.exe', and 'svchost.exe' with registry events might be normal, but combined with the service creation, it's more suspicious.\n\nThe 'powershell.exe' processes being accessed and the 'Image loaded' events for 'urlmon.dll' and 'amsi.dll' could be part of the attack. These DLLs are related to Internet Explorer and Windows Defender, respectively. Loading them might be an attempt to bypass security measures or interact with the system in a way that's not typical.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory might be part of the attacker's data exfiltration or configuration. However, the main concern here is the service creation and the use of PowerShell scripts that are referenced as non-existing, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of creating a service with a suspicious script, using PowerShell, and modifying the registry points towards potential malicious activity. Even though some events might be benign on their own, the overall pattern is indicative of an attack. The confidence is high because these are classic signs of malware attempting to persist and execute commands.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious service creation via sc.exe with PowerShell scripts referenced as 'NonExistingScript.ps1', indicating potential malicious persistence attempts. The combination of registry modifications, process creation, and non-standard file paths suggests adversarial activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
