The first event stands out: powershell.exe is creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". Then, it starts that service.

All of them are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. The winlog entries mention \"File Executable Detected\" under the rule FileExecutableDetected. The files are all in the Temp directory under a specific GUID folder, which is common for temporary files.\n\nNow, the paths include files like DismHost.exe, DismProv.dll, and various .mui files. The .mui files are typically language-specific resources, which are legitimate. However, the presence of multiple executable files in the Temp directory might be suspicious. But wait, Dism.exe is known to generate temporary files during operations like system image deployment or package servicing. \n\nThe key here is whether these files are part of normal Dism operations. Since the files are in the Temp directory and the process is Dism.exe, which is a legitimate system process, this could be part of a normal system activity. However, the fact that multiple executable files are being detected might indicate something unusual. But without additional context, such as other processes or network activity, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. Since all events are from a legitimate process and the files are in the Temp directory, which is expected for temporary files, this might not be malicious. However, the high number of detected files could be a sign of something more. But I need to consider that Dism might be running a legitimate task, like a system update or deployment. \n\nGiven that, the confidence is moderate. It's not clearly malicious, but it's also not entirely benign. However, since the user is asking if it's relevant for investigation, and the events are all from a legitimate process, maybe it's not interesting. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Maybe the presence of multiple .exe and .dll files in the Temp directory is more suspicious, but I need to check if that's normal for Dism. \n\nAfter checking, Dism does use temporary files during its operations, so this might be normal. Therefore, the classification might be NOT INTERESTING. But I'm not 100% sure. The confidence would be around 0.6, but maybe lower. Hmm.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event and looking for any suspicious patterns.\n\nFirst, there's an event where svchost.exe created a file in C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness\\. The path has a SID (S-1-5...) which is unusual. Normally, AppReadiness might have files related to system readiness, but a file with a SID in the path could be something unexpected. Maybe a malicious file disguised as a legitimate one? Not sure yet, but worth noting.\n\nNext, there are several PowerShell.exe processes. The first one runs a simple Write-Host command, which seems benign. But then there's another PowerShell command that checks INF files for certain patterns. The command is looking for sections like [defaultinstall.nt...], which might be related to Windows installation or driver setup. However, the script is scanning INF files in the system's inf directory. That could be part of a legitimate process, but maybe it's trying to detect if certain features are installed, which could be a precursor to disabling them, like the Windows Defender feature later on.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe command that disables the Windows Defender feature using DISM. That's a red flag. Disabling Windows Defender is a common tactic for malware to avoid detection. The DISM process is being used here, which is a legitimate tool, but the action itself is suspicious. Also, the user is running this with \/quiet, so no user interaction, which is typical in automated attacks.\n\nLooking at the Dism.exe events, there are files created in the Temp directory, like CbsProvider.dll and DismHost.exe. These are temporary files, but the fact that they're being created and executed might be part of a larger process. However, DISM is a legitimate tool, so unless these files are malicious, it's not necessarily bad. But the combination with the PowerShell script that disables Defender makes me think there's an attempt to remove security features.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated loading of .dll files by PowerShell, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET. These are standard for PowerShell, but the fact that they're being loaded multiple times might be part of a script's execution. However, there's no obvious malicious code here.\n\nThe file created in C:\\Windows\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest... might be part of a script execution, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the presence of Temp files being created and executed is common in both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious part is the cmd.exe command disabling Windows Defender. That's a clear indicator of an attempt to compromise the system by removing a security layer. Even if other events are normal, this action alone is a strong sign of malicious intent. The PowerShell scripts might be part of the process to check for features that can be disabled, and the DISM commands are executing those changes. The svchost.exe file creation might be unrelated, but the overall pattern of disabling Defender is a red flag.\n\nSo, the classification here should be INTERESTING because there's a clear attempt to disable Windows Defender, which is a significant security risk. The confidence is high because disabling Defender is a known malicious activity. The justification would be the disabling of Windows Defender via DISM and the associated PowerShell scripts.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains events indicating an attempt to disable Windows Defender using DISM, which is a common tactic in malware operations to evade detection.

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where 'setup.exe' is creating files. The paths mentioned are in Program Files (x86) under Microsoft EdgeCore and Edge, like setup.exe, msedge.exe, and pwahelper.exe. Those seem like legitimate Microsoft Edge files, but I should check if they're in the correct directories. Also, there are entries where svchost.exe is creating files in the Windows Temp directory with APPX temporary files. That's normal for Windows updates or installations, but maybe there's something suspicious here.\n\nThen there are multiple registry events from svchost.exe and setup.exe. Registry changes can be normal, but if there's a lot of them, it might indicate something like a configuration change or maybe malware trying to modify the registry. However, svchost.exe is a common system process, so it's possible these are legitimate.\n\nWait, the first event has setup.exe creating a file in the EdgeCore directory. But then there's another setup.exe creating a file in the Edge Application folder. That might be part of an installation process. However, the same setup.exe is also creating files in the WindowsApps directory, which is where Microsoft Store apps are installed. The EdgeGameAssist.exe file mentioned there is part of Edge's Game Assist feature, so that's legitimate.\n\nBut then there are multiple Pipe Created events from setup.exe. Named pipes can be used for communication between processes, but if there are a lot of them, it might be a red flag. However, setup.exe is a common installer, so maybe that's normal.\n\nLooking at the svchost.exe entries creating files in the Temp directory with APPX names. These are temporary files created during app installations or updates. The fact that there are several of them might be part of a legitimate update process. However, if these files are being created in unusual locations or with unusual names, that could be suspicious. But the paths here look standard for Windows.\n\nAnother thing to note is that setup.exe is involved in both file creation and registry modifications. If setup.exe is part of a legitimate installation, that's normal. But if it's a malicious installer, those actions could be harmful. However, the file paths point to Microsoft Edge components, which are legitimate. But maybe the presence of multiple setup.exe activities in different locations could indicate a broader issue.\n\nWait, the first setup.exe is in the EdgeCore directory, which might be a newer version of Edge. But I need to check if that's a legitimate path. Also, the fact that setup.exe is creating files in the WindowsApps directory, which is for Microsoft Store apps, might be part of a proper installation. However, if setup.exe is not supposed to be there, that could be a problem.\n\nBut the justification for classifying this as interesting would be if there's a pattern that deviates from normal behavior. However, all the events here seem to be related to installation processes, which are normal. The svchost.exe creating temp files is standard. The registry events are also common during installations. So maybe this isn't suspicious. But I should check if there's any unusual combination.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the setup.exe is creating files in the EdgeCore and Edge directories. But EdgeCore might be a different component. Also, the presence of multiple setup.exe processes might be normal if multiple installations are happening. However, the confidence here is low because all the activities seem legitimate. Unless there's something I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that setup.exe is involved in both file creation and registry changes, along with svchost.exe creating temp files, could be part of a legitimate update. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, since all the file paths are in standard locations for Microsoft products, and the processes involved are common system processes, this might not be interesting. Therefore, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING with low confidence, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, but the user's instructions say to analyze the entire batch as a whole.

The names of the DLLs are things like WimProvider.dll.mui, FfuProvider.dll, etc. These might be legitimate files if they're part of a Windows image or setup process, but the fact that they're in the Temp directory could be suspicious.\n\nThen there's an event where DismHost.exe is created with a command line that includes a GUID, which might be part of a normal operation, but I need to check. The next two events show Image Load rules for DismHost.exe and DismProv.dll from the same Temp directory. \n\nNow, Dism.exe is part of the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool, used for Windows image management. It's common during OS deployment or sysprep, so the presence of these files might be legitimate if the user is performing such tasks. However, the large number of DLLs being loaded from the Temp directory could be a red flag.

However, legitimate processes can also use Temp directories. The key here is the combination of multiple suspicious file detections and the use of a GUID in the command line, which might be an indicator of something more malicious. \n\nConsidering the rule names, \"File Executable Detected\" and \"Process Create\" are part of security monitoring rules. If these are triggered by the system's own processes, it might be a false positive, but the sheer number of events and the location of the files in Temp might lean towards being interesting for investigation.

In a legitimate scenario, DismHost might load various providers during a deployment task. However, the fact that all these DLLs are in the Temp directory, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files, could be a red flag.

The script is looking for sections like [defaultinstall.nt...], which might be related to driver installations or other system configurations. The fact that the script is scanning these INF files could be a red flag. Why would someone be checking these files with PowerShell? Maybe they're trying to detect if certain drivers or system components are present, which could be part of a larger malicious activity, like checking for vulnerabilities or preparing for exploitation.\n\nAlso, note that the ExecutionPolicy is set to Restricted, which is the default. But if the script is running under Restricted policy, it's supposed to prevent running scripts unless they're signed or come from a trusted location. However, the user is explicitly using Restricted, which might be a way to bypass certain restrictions, or maybe it's a misconfiguration.\n\nWait, but the commands themselves don't seem to do anything harmful. They just read the INF files and check for those patterns. However, the repetition of the same command across multiple events might indicate that this is part of a larger process.

The user provided a bunch of log entries, all related to the Dism.exe process deleting various DLL files in the Temp directory. The task is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Dism.exe does. DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) is a tool used for Windows image management. It's commonly used for tasks like adding, removing, or configuring features in Windows images. So, normally, Dism.exe might be involved in system updates or deployments.\n\nNow, looking at the logs, all the events are about file deletions. The files are in the Temp folder, which is a common place for temporary files. However, the fact that multiple DLLs are being deleted by Dism.exe might be part of a legitimate process. For example, during an image deployment, old or unnecessary files might be cleaned up. But then again, attackers sometimes use legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nWait, but are these deletions part of a normal operation? The filenames like IBSProvider.dll.mui, IntlProvider.dll.mui, etc., seem to be related to system components. If Dism is deleting these, maybe it's part of a cleanup after an installation or update. However, the presence of multiple deletions could also indicate that someone is trying to remove evidence or malicious files. But without any other suspicious activities like process creation, network connections, or unauthorized access, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point: all the events are from the same process, Dism.exe. If this is a legitimate use, then it's not a problem. But if Dism.exe was compromised, it could be doing something it shouldn't. However, the logs only show deletions, no other activities. Also, the Temp directory is a common place for temporary files, so maybe these are just temporary files being cleaned up.\n\nBut why so many deletions? Maybe part of a larger operation. However, without more context, like other events or the system's state, it's hard to say. The classification here depends on whether these deletions are abnormal. Since Dism.exe is a legitimate tool, and the Temp directory is a common place for temporary files, this might be normal. However, the large number of deletions could be a red flag. But I'm not sure. Maybe the user is expecting that this is normal, or maybe it's a sign of something else.\n\nWait, but the justification needs to be concise. The key here is that all the events are related to Dism.exe deleting files in the Temp directory. Since Dism.exe is a legitimate tool used in system deployments, and the Temp directory is a common place for temporary files, this might be part of a normal process. However, the repeated deletions could be part of a cleanup, which is normal. Unless there's a pattern indicating something malicious, but the logs don't show that. So maybe this is not interesting. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the fact that so many files are being deleted by Dism.exe is unusual and warrants investigation. But without more context, it's hard to say. The confidence level would be around 0.5, but I need to decide. Since the user is asking for a classification, and the justification, I think the answer is that it's not interesting because Dism.exe is a legitimate tool and the Temp directory is normal for temporary files.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of JSON entries that look like log entries from a Windows system, probably from something like the Windows Event Log or a security monitoring tool. They want me to analyze these logs and figure out what's going on.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the structure of the logs. Each entry has \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" fields. The \"process\" field seems to contain details about a process, like the command line used to start it. The \"winlog\" field has a \"task\" which might indicate the type of event, like \"Process Create\" or \"Provider Lifecycle\". The \"file\" field is \"None\" in most cases, which might mean that the event doesn't involve a file, or that the file information isn't captured here.\n\nLooking at the first entry, the \"process\" field has a command line that starts with \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Microsoft\\\\Edge\\\\Application\\\\msedge.exe\" and includes a long string that looks like a base64-encoded payload. The \"winlog\" task is \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\". This suggests that a new process was created, and the command line includes a suspicious base64 string, which might be an indicator of a malicious payload or some encoded script. The file name is \"None\", so maybe the file path isn't logged here, but the process itself is.\n\nThen there are several entries with \"process\" as \"None\" and \"winlog\" task as \"None\". These might be incomplete logs or errors in the logging system. I should note that these entries might not be relevant or could be placeholders.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where the \"process\" command line is \"powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" -BinaryPathName \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\\\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\"}\". The \"winlog\" task here is \"Provider Lifecycle\" and then \"Engine Lifecycle\". This seems like someone is using PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". Then they start the service. This is suspicious because creating a new service can be a tactic used by malware to persist on a system. The service name and the executable path don't look standard, so that's a red flag. The \"winlog\" task being \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\" might relate to the internal operations of the logging or monitoring tool, but I need to check what those tasks mean in the context of the system.\n\nAnother entry has a \"process\" command line of \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';\". The \"winlog\" task is \"Provider Lifecycle\" again. This is a PowerShell command that writes \"Final result: 1\" to the host, which might be a test command or part of a script. The ExecutionPolicy being \"Restricted\" is the default, so that's not necessarily malicious, but the fact that it's being used in the logs might be part of a larger script or test.\n\nPutting this all together, the main points are:\n\n1. A process was created with msedge.exe and a base64-encoded string, which could be malicious.\n2. Multiple PowerShell commands are creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with an executable at \"tarefa_logico.exe\", which is not a standard path and might be part of an attack.\n3. There are entries with \"None\" values, which might be incomplete or irrelevant logs.\n\nPotential threats here could be the creation of a new service that's not part of the normal system configuration, which is a common tactic for malware to persist. The base64 string in the first entry might be an encoded payload that's being executed, which could be part of a payload delivery or execution phase.\n\nI should also consider the context. If this is from a security monitoring system, these events might be alerts. The presence of multiple PowerShell commands creating a service could be an indicator of compromise, especially if the service is not expected. The base64 string might be an encoded script or payload that's being executed, which could be malicious.\n\nI need to check if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is a legitimate file. If it's not a known, trusted executable, that's a problem. Also, the service name \"objeto_ativo\" doesn't ring a bell as a standard Windows service. The use of PowerShell to create services is a common method for attackers to maintain persistence.\n\nIn summary, the key suspicious activities are the creation of a new service with a non-standard executable and the presence of a base64-encoded string in the command line of msedge.exe. The logs might be indicating a potential security incident, and further investigation would be needed to confirm if these are malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate several suspicious activities that may indicate a potential security incident.
