{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess event. Not too bad, but not immediately suspicious. Then there are several chrome.exe entries with Registry value set events. Multiple registry changes from chrome might be normal, but maybe if they're all the same, but here they are repeated multiple times. However, chrome doing registry writes could be part of normal operations, but maybe not.\n\nThen there's a command_line entry for powershell.exe that's executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The name of the script sounds really suspicious. Keystrokes usually relate to keylogging, which is a common malicious activity. The script is being run with different paths each time, but the command line is similar. The fact that it's being executed multiple times with different paths might indicate an attempt to evade detection by varying the location.\n\nAlso, looking at the file events: there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic used by malware to leave no trace. The file is a PowerShell script, which could be part of an attack. Additionally, there's a Pipe Created event, which might be used for inter-process communication, possibly for command and control channels.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple ImageLoaded events for .NET assemblies. While some of these are legitimate system files (like clr.dll), the presence of multiple image loads, especially when combined with other suspicious activities, could indicate something is wrong.\n\nThe user mentioned that the classification should be based on the entire batch. The key points here are the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script, the Temp file creation and deletion, and the multiple registry changes. These together point towards potential malicious activity, even if individual events might not be enough on their own. The confidence level should be high because the combination of these factors is strong indicators of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with varying paths, combined with temp file creation\/deletion and suspicious registry activity, indicates potential keylogging malware.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each line one by one.\n\nFirst event: The process is powershell.exe running a script that's downloading keystrokes to a temp file. The command line includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the TEMP directory. That seems suspicious because keystroke logging is often related to malware or keyloggers.\n\nSecond event: A file is created at C:\\elemento_comum... with Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The path is a bit long and has some unusual folder names. The winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command,\" which might indicate that the script was executed remotely, which is a red flag.\n\nThird event: Powershell.exe creates a file in the user's Downloads folder. Not sure yet, maybe a normal download. The file name is pacote_temporario.txt. Not obviously malicious yet.\n\nFourth event: Svchost.exe creates a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization folder. That's a system process, but creating files there might be normal, but I should check if it's expected. However, svchost is often used by legitimate processes, so maybe not suspicious here.\n\nFifth event: Another powershell.exe creating a file in the same Downloads folder as the third event. The file is entrada_padrao.txt. Again, could be normal.\n\nNow, looking for patterns. The Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script is mentioned in the first and second events. That script's purpose is to capture keystrokes, which is a clear sign of malicious intent. The fact that it's being executed via PowerShell and writing to a temporary file suggests it's trying to log keystrokes without the user's knowledge. The second event mentions a file creation related to that script, which might be part of the same attack chain.\n\nThe other events involve normal file creations in Downloads, which could be benign. However, the presence of the keystroke logging script is a strong indicator of malicious activity. Even though some events might be normal, the combination of the Get-Keystrokes script and the execution via PowerShell with a remote command task makes this batch interesting for investigation.\n\nI should check if the script's presence is common. Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is known in some malware contexts. Also, the fact that the log path is in the TEMP directory is a common tactic for malware to hide logs. The classification here should be INTERESTING because of the keystroke logging and the remote execution. Confidence is high, maybe 0.9, because the indicators are clear.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains events involving the execution of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' via PowerShell, which is a known keystroke logging script often associated with malicious activity. The script's log path is set to a temporary directory, a common tactic for stealthy data exfiltration.
