{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries involving PowerShell.exe. The first event is a ProcessAccess for PowerShell, then a ProcessCreate for whoami.exe, and another ProcessAccess for PowerShell again.\n\nHmm, whoami.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used to display the current user's identity. But when combined with PowerShell, it might be part of a larger process. However, in this case, the events don't show any unusual parameters or commands. The command line for whoami.exe is just the standard path. \n\nWait, but the user is asking if this batch is interesting. The key here is that there are two ProcessAccess events for PowerShell. ProcessAccess can be a sign of lateral movement or privilege escalation if it's accessing other processes. However, without more context like file access, network activity, or suspicious command-line arguments, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe files field is None in all events, so no file access is mentioned. The events are all about process creation and access. Since whoami.exe is a normal tool, and PowerShell is commonly used, maybe this is just routine activity. But repeated access to PowerShell might be worth investigating, especially if there's a pattern. However, with only two events and no other indicators, the confidence level might be low. \n\nI think the classification here is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's not enough evidence of malicious activity. The events don't show any clear signs of compromise, like unexpected command-line arguments, unusual network connections, or access to sensitive files. The confidence is around 0.4 because there's some repetition, but nothing definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show standard process creation\/access for legitimate tools (powershell.exe and whoami.exe) without suspicious parameters, file access, or network activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about MpDefenderCoreService.exe with a network connection detected. That's part of Microsoft Defender, so maybe legitimate, but sometimes malware can mimic legitimate processes. However, just one event might not be enough.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. Chrome doing normal browsing would have these, but if there's a lot of connections to suspicious domains, that could be a red flag. But the data here doesn't mention specific domains, so maybe not conclusive yet.\n\nNext, there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe processes. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. The command lines here include things like 'dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key' and 'findstr \/e .key', which might be searching for files with .key extensions. That could be part of a data exfiltration attempt or looking for sensitive files. Also, there are multiple instances of Registry value set events, which might indicate changes to the registry, possibly for persistence.\n\nThe whoami.exe command is run, which just gets the user context, but not too suspicious on its own. However, when combined with other commands, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThere's also a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file path is in the downloads folder, which might be normal if it's part of an installation. But the same file is created twice, which could be normal or maybe an attempt to overwrite or modify configuration files. Another file created by powershell.exe is 'tarefa_geral.txt', which doesn't seem immediately suspicious, but the context matters.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: multiple process creations, network activity, registry changes, and file creations. The use of PowerShell and CMD with commands that search for files could be indicative of an attacker trying to find sensitive information. However, without more context like specific IP addresses, domains, or unusual file content, it's a bit hard to tell. But the combination of these events, especially the repeated registry changes and file creations, along with the use of command-line tools, might suggest a potential security incident. However, it's not definitive. The confidence level would be moderate, maybe around 0.6, because while there are suspicious activities, they could also be part of legitimate system operations or user actions.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated registry modifications, file creation in download directories, and command-line operations searching for '.key' files, which may indicate data exfiltration or reconnaissance. PowerShell and CMD usage patterns suggest potential malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: winlogbeat.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipper, and creating configuration files is part of its setup. But maybe the path is in the Downloads folder, which isn't unusual, but I should note it.\n\nThen there are several entries about Registry value set events. Processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, svchost.exe, and others are setting registry values. Registry changes can be normal, but if multiple processes are doing it, especially if they're not typically known for that, it might be suspicious. However, svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, and it's normal for it to interact with the registry. Similarly, RuntimeBroker.exe is associated with UAC prompts, so setting registry values there might be okay.\n\nNext, powershell.exe has a Process accessed event. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but just accessing a process isn't necessarily malicious. There's also an Image loaded event for calc.exe loading urlmon.dll from System32. That's a legitimate system file, so that's probably normal. Similarly, Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is also expected.\n\nThen there are a bunch of chrome.exe events. Most of them are Registry value set events, which could be part of Chrome's normal operation. However, there's an Image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are part of Windows Defender, so loading them is normal. But the fact that Chrome is loading these might be a red flag? Wait, no, because Chrome might interact with Windows Defender components. But I need to check if that's typical.\n\nWait, looking again, the ImageLoad events for chrome.exe are loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate files. However, if Chrome is loading unexpected DLLs, that could be a problem. But in this case, they are standard system files. So that might not be an issue.\n\nNow, looking for any anomalies. The first event about winlogbeat creating a file might be normal, but if there are multiple such events or if the file is in an unusual location, that could be a concern. However, in this case, it's a standard configuration file for winlogbeat. The other events don't show any obvious malicious activity. There's no mention of suspicious processes, unexpected network activity, or unusual file modifications beyond the winlogbeat file.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple registry changes and image loads might be part of normal system operations, especially with Chrome and svchost.exe. But if there's a pattern of multiple registry changes by different processes, that could be a sign of something. However, without more context, like other events or known bad indicators, it's hard to say.\n\nConsidering all this, the only potentially interesting event is the creation of the winlogbeat configuration file. But since it's a legitimate process, maybe it's not enough to classify as interesting. The rest of the events seem to be part of normal system operations. So perhaps the batch isn't interesting enough for investigation. However, the confidence might be low because there's not enough evidence of malicious activity. But maybe the repeated registry events could be a red flag. Hmm. Alternatively, if the user is concerned about winlogbeat being used in a way that's not typical, but the file creation is part of its normal setup. So overall, I think the classification is NOT INTERESTING because there's no clear malicious activity detected in the logs provided.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily reflect normal system operations, including legitimate file creation by winlogbeat.exe (a log shipper), registry modifications by standard processes (e.g., svchost.exe, chrome.exe), and loading of legitimate system DLLs (e.g., urlmon.dll, amsi.dll). No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
