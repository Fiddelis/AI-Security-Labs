{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there's a 'whoami.exe' process created, which is normal. But then there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' with various tasks. The command line in one of the entries stands out: it's using findstr and select-string to search for 'password' in files. That seems suspicious because searching for passwords in files could be part of a data exfiltration attempt. \n\nLooking further, there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET DLLs, which might be normal if PowerShell is running scripts that require those libraries. However, the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the same command line might indicate something's wrong. Also, there's a temporary file created and then deleted, which could be a red flag if it's part of a malicious script trying to execute and then clean up.\n\nThe combination of searching for passwords, loading .NET assemblies, and temporary file operations might suggest an attempt to find sensitive information. However, I should check if these are just normal operations. For example, PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but the specific command here is looking for passwords in various file types, which could be part of a malicious activity. \n\nThe confidence level is a bit tricky. There are some suspicious elements, but without more context like network activity or other anomalies, it's not definitive. However, the repeated events and the specific command line make me lean towards 'INTERESTING' with a confidence around 0.7. It's not a smoking gun, but enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to search for 'password' in files across various formats (XML, DOC, TXT, XLS), combined with temporary file creation and deletion, suggests potential data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe. One of them has a command line that includes findstr and select-string with patterns looking for 'pass' and 'password' in various file types. That seems like someone is trying to search for passwords in files. That's a red flag because it could indicate an attempt to find sensitive information on the system.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. But the path is in the Downloads directory, which might be normal. However, the presence of multiple powershell.exe processes running with those commands could be part of a larger effort to search for credentials or other sensitive data.\n\nAlso, there are several registry value set events, but those might be part of normal operations unless they're modifying critical keys. However, the main concern here is the repeated use of PowerShell to search for passwords. This behavior is often associated with malware or attackers trying to extract credentials from the system.\n\nThe other processes like calc.exe, notepad.exe, and chrome.exe don't seem suspicious on their own. The image loaded events for urlmon.dll and MpClient.dll are also common. However, the combination of the PowerShell commands with the file search patterns is concerning.\n\nI should check if there are any other indicators. The task names like 'Process accessed' and 'Image loaded' are normal, but the command line in the PowerShell process stands out. The fact that the same command is repeated in different events might indicate that the process is being run multiple times, possibly to cover all directories or to avoid detection.\n\nConsidering all this, the presence of PowerShell scripts searching for passwords in files is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Even though some events might be benign, the combination here is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence level around 0.85 because it's a clear sign of searching for sensitive information, which is a common attack technique.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to search for 'password' patterns in files across the system, which is a common technique used in credential harvesting attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are related to chrome.exe performing various tasks like registry value sets, DNS queries, and network connections. That's normal for a browser, right? But then I see a couple of other entries. There's one where winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's just part of normal operations, but creating a .yml.new file might be something. However, without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nThen there's an entry where chrome.exe loaded amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. Loading these files is normal because Chrome might interact with the antivirus. But why is this logged? Maybe it's just part of the system's normal functioning. However, if these files were loaded from unexpected locations, that could be a red flag. But the paths here are standard system paths, so that's probably okay.\n\nAnother event is powershell.exe creating a file called objeto_logico.txt. That's a text file, so unless there's something unusual about its content, it might not be a problem. But again, without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the frequency, there are multiple registry value sets and network connections from chrome.exe. That could be normal if the user is browsing a lot, but if it's excessive or directed at suspicious domains, that might be an issue. However, the logs don't mention specific domains or IPs, just the task types.\n\nThe DNS queries are also common for a browser. The only thing that stands out is the repeated registry changes. However, Chrome does modify the registry for various settings, so that's not necessarily malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The events don't show any obvious signs of malware, unauthorized access, or suspicious file operations. The few non-chrome.exe events are either part of normal system processes or user activities. Therefore, this batch might not be interesting for investigation. But I should check if there's any combination of events that could indicate something. For example, if chrome.exe was modifying registry keys related to security or loading unexpected DLLs. But the DLLs here are legitimate. So, I think the classification is NOT INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal browser activity (chrome.exe performing registry operations, DNS queries, and network connections) and benign file operations (e.g., winlogbeat file creation, PowerShell text file creation).

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, part of Elastic's Winlogbeat, used for logging. Maybe just a normal installation or configuration. But then there's a second event where powershell.exe creates a file called estrutura_ativo.txt. Not sure what that is yet. Could be benign, but maybe something else.\n\nThen there's a line with \"process\": None and \"winlog\": None. That might be a placeholder or an error in the log, but not sure yet. Then winlogbeat.exe again creates the same .yml.new file. Maybe it's just a configuration file being written, which is normal. But why is it happening twice? Maybe a retry or a misconfiguration?\n\nLooking further, there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Multiple entries of ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, and ProcessCreate. For example, cmd.exe is running schtasks commands to delete scheduled tasks. That's suspicious. Deleting scheduled tasks could be part of a cleanup, but if done by an attacker, it might be to remove traces. Also, the command_line has some redirection of output to nul, which might be to hide the command's execution.\n\nThen there's schtasks.exe being used to delete tasks named things like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". These names are a bit generic, but the deletion of scheduled tasks could be part of an attack. Also, there's an image loaded from taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate system file, but the context here might matter.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe is normal, just checking the user. But the repeated access to processes and registry changes by powershell.exe and cmd.exe could indicate some form of persistence or configuration changes. The registry events might be modifying keys to maintain access or change system behavior.\n\nHowever, there are multiple instances where the same processes are logged, like powershell.exe creating files and accessing processes. But without more context, like if these are part of a known legitimate script or if there are other signs of compromise, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple scheduled task deletions and registry modifications might be red flags, especially if done by an unexpected process or user.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the batch is interesting. So even if some parts are normal (like winlogbeat), the combination of multiple suspicious activities (deleting scheduled tasks, registry changes, repeated process access) might indicate something malicious. However, without seeing other indicators like unexpected network activity, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration, it's a bit ambiguous. But the fact that there are multiple events related to process access and registry changes, along with scheduled task deletions, might be enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n\nConfidence-wise, it's not 100% certain, but there are enough suspicious elements to warrant looking into it more. So I'd say INTERESTING with moderate confidence, maybe around 0.65. The justification would be the combination of scheduled task deletions, registry modifications, and multiple process accesses that could indicate an attack or configuration changes.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including deletion of scheduled tasks (schtasks.exe), registry modifications, and repeated process access by PowerShell and cmd.exe, which could indicate malicious behavior or system tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: cmd.exe is running a command to delete processes named notepad.exe using WMIC. That seems suspicious because deleting processes isn't normal behavior. Then there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry. The next few events show WMIC.exe loading DLLs like urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a malicious process is loading this, maybe it's trying to bypass detection. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe modifying registry values. The command lines include deleting users with net user \/del, which could be part of an attack to remove accounts. Also, there's a net1.exe which might be a typo or a malicious binary trying to mimic net.exe. \n\nThe repeated use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe to delete processes, modify the registry, and delete user accounts suggests an attempt to manipulate the system. The loading of specific DLLs might be part of a larger attack, like disabling security features. \n\nPutting this all together, these activities are indicative of a potential compromise. The combination of process deletion, registry changes, and user account removal are all signs of malicious activity. The confidence here is pretty high, maybe around 0.9, because there are multiple suspicious actions that don't align with normal user behavior. I need to make sure there's no benign explanation, but given the context, it's likely a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of processes (notepad.exe), registry modifications, execution of WMIC and PowerShell commands, and user account deletion attempts.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of PowerShell and cmd.exe activities. I remember that PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a red flag. Then, there are several instances of 'net user ... \/del \/domain' commands. Deleting user accounts in a domain could be part of an attack, like removing existing users to take over their accounts or to cover tracks.\n\nAlso, there's the 'sc delete win32times' command. Deleting a service might be an attempt to remove something that's monitoring or logging activities. The 'whoami.exe' command is used to get the current user's identity, which could be part of privilege escalation checks.\n\nThe Registry events might indicate changes to system settings or attempts to modify critical keys. The repeated 'Registry value set' and 'Registry object added or deleted' could be part of configuring persistence or disabling security features.\n\nHowever, I should check if these activities are normal. For example, deleting a service might be part of a legitimate maintenance task, but combined with the user account deletions and the use of PowerShell, it's more concerning. Also, the presence of multiple 'Security Group Management' events might relate to changing group memberships, which could be part of lateral movement.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of deleting user accounts, modifying the registry, and deleting services, along with the use of command-line tools, suggests a possible attack.

Let me start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there's 'whoami.exe' being run, which is normal for checking user context. Then, multiple 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' processes are created. Some of them have command lines that look suspicious, like deleting temporary files. Wait, the command line in one of the 'cmd.exe' entries is \"del %%temp%%\\\\unidade_temporario_calc.txt\" and similar files. Deleting temporary files might be normal, but combined with other actions?\n\nLooking further, there's a 'File Delete logged' event for a specific file in the Temp directory. That's a legitimate action, but maybe part of a larger pattern. Then, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events for both 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe'. Changing registry values can be part of malware persistence, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with 'powershell.exe & {}' might be part of PowerShell's normal operation, but repeated entries could indicate something. Also, the 'Image loaded' events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll are normal when running .NET applications, but if PowerShell is loading them in an unusual way, that might be a red flag.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events include both legitimate system processes and common administrative tasks. The deletion of temporary files and registry changes aren't necessarily malicious on their own.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to PowerShell.exe. That's common, but I should check for any suspicious activities. Let's go through each event.\n\nThe first few entries are about image loaded events. The files mentioned are system files like mscorlib.ni.dll and clrjit.dll. Those are part of the .NET framework, so they're legitimate. The Windows Defender DLL is also a legitimate file. So these might be normal operations.\n\nThen there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. That's a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting it might be part of a test, but sometimes attackers use temporary files to execute malicious scripts. However, since it's deleted afterward, it could be benign, but it's something to note.\n\nThere's a pipe created event, but no file involved. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other events, it might be relevant.\n\nThe command line entry shows \"powershell.exe & {}\", which is an empty command. That might be a placeholder or a test, but not harmful on its own.\n\nRegistry value set events for PowerShell and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, since it's just a registry event, maybe not malicious.\n\nMultiple process accessed events for PowerShell. These could indicate that other processes are interacting with PowerShell, which might be normal, but if there's a pattern, it could be suspicious.\n\nThere are also entries for whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to check user context, so that's probably legitimate. But if done repeatedly, maybe part of a script.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event is about creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's part of normal operations if it's configured properly. The .yml.new file suggests a configuration change, which might be routine.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events seem legitimate, part of normal system operations and testing. The temporary file creation and deletion could be part of a script test. However, the repeated process accesses and registry changes might indicate some level of activity that's worth investigating. But since there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms, it's leaning towards not interesting. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell activities and temporary files might warrant a closer look. The confidence is moderate, around 0.6, because there are some suspicious elements but not enough to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events involving temporary file creation\/deletion and process access may indicate script-based activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. Hmm, so the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances of 'whoami.exe' being created. That's a standard Windows command to get the current user's identity. But then there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' processes with 'Process accessed' events. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a red flag. However, just having PowerShell access isn't necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nLooking further, there are some 'Image loaded' events for 'urlmon.dll' under both 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe'. Wait, 'urlmon.dll' is part of Internet Explorer and is used for handling URLs, but if it's being loaded by a calculator app, that might be unusual. But maybe it's a legitimate scenario? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal if it's part of its setup. But the file path is '.winlogbeat.yml.new', which could be a temporary file during configuration. Not sure if that's suspicious.\n\nThe registry events involve 'svchost.exe', 'RuntimeBroker.exe', 'notepad.exe', and others. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're modifying critical keys, that's a problem. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being changed. So not enough info there.\n\nThe 'chrome.exe' entries show DNS queries and network connections. Multiple DNS queries and network connections from Chrome could be normal browsing, but if there's a pattern, like connecting to suspicious domains, that's an issue. But the logs don't mention the domains, so I can't tell.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a lot of PowerShell activity, which is common in both legitimate and malicious scenarios. The 'urlmon.dll' being loaded by calculator apps might be worth checking. However, without more context like unusual command lines, unexpected network destinations, or other indicators of compromise, it's hard to say. The presence of 'whoami.exe' is normal. The winlogbeat activity seems legitimate. The registry changes are not detailed enough to be concerning.\n\nSo overall, while there are some potentially suspicious elements, they don't form a clear pattern of malicious activity.
