{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal, maybe part of an installation or configuration. Then there are several entries about ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and various instances of powershell.exe and chrome.exe triggering registry events. \n\nWait, the registry value set events are common, but maybe not suspicious on their own. However, looking at the process names, Calculator.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe aren't typically involved in malicious activities. The chrome.exe entries are numerous, but most of them are registry changes. However, there's one image loaded event for amsi.dll and another for MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that's probably just Chrome loading them as part of its normal operations.\n\nBut then there's the powershell.exe entries. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. However, in this batch, the only events related to powershell.exe are registry value set and process accessed. No actual command execution or suspicious scripts are mentioned here. The process accessed event might indicate someone trying to interact with the process, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe main thing here is that the majority of events are normal system activities. The winlogbeat file creation is likely part of a legitimate setup. The chrome.exe events are standard, and the registry changes might be from updates or configuration changes. The only slightly odd thing is the number of registry events from chrome.exe, but that could be due to multiple instances or different operations. \n\nOverall, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The events don't form a pattern that suggests an attack. So I'd classify this as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events reflect normal system operations (e.g., file creation during software setup, registry changes from legitimate processes like Chrome and PowerShell, and loading of Windows Defender DLLs). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being accessed or created. That's a common pattern in some attacks, but not always malicious. However, looking deeper, there's a line where cmd.exe is used with the command \"sc create win32times binPath= ...\". The sc command is used to create services. The binPath here is pointing to a script that doesn't exist (\"NonExistingScript.ps1\"). That seems suspicious because creating a service with a non-existent script might be an attempt to hide malicious activity or set up a backdoor.\n\nAlso, there are several Registry value set events. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms, like modifying startup entries or services. The fact that services.exe and sc.exe are involved in these changes might indicate someone is trying to modify system services. \n\nAnother thing is the Image loaded events for urlmon.dll. While urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows component, loading it from a non-standard path or in an unusual context could be a red flag. However, in the logs provided, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the standard location, so that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThe repeated use of 'Registry value set' by services.exe and other processes might indicate an attempt to modify system settings for persistence. Also, the presence of multiple process creations and registry changes without clear legitimate purpose could be indicative of malicious activity.\n\nHowever, there's also a line with 'notepad.exe' and 'RuntimeBroker.exe' which are normal processes. But the frequency and combination of events might still be concerning. \n\nPutting it all together: creating a service with a non-existent script, multiple registry modifications, and unusual process accesses could be signs of an attack. The confidence is high enough to flag this as interesting, but not 100% certain without more context. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with confidence around 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of a service with a non-existent script path (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1), repeated registry modifications by system processes, and frequent PowerShell\/cmd.exe executions which are often associated with malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
