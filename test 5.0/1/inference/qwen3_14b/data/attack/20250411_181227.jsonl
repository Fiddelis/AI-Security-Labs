{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are multiple instances of PowerShell commands. The command lines are similar, each time creating a scheduled task with 'calc.exe' as the action. The triggers are set to run at logon, and the principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with the highest run level. That's a red flag because running tasks with admin privileges can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if it's done without user knowledge.\n\nNow, the scheduled task names vary each time: unidade_ativo, registro_geral, entrada_ativo, etc. But the pattern is consistent. The use of 'calc.exe' is unusual here because it's a legitimate calculator program, but in the context of scheduled tasks triggered at logon with admin rights, it might be a way to execute arbitrary code. Attackers often use scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on a system.\n\nAlso, there are multiple entries for PowerShell processes with different event types: Registry value set, Process accessed, Image loaded. The image loaded events point to mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. However, if these are being loaded in an unexpected context, it might indicate something malicious, like a .NET-based payload.\n\nBut wait, the main concern here is the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with admin privileges. Even though calc.exe is a legitimate executable, the combination of high privileges and scheduled tasks could be a method to execute code under admin rights. This is a common technique in privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any other benign processes. For example, chrome.exe events are present, but they're related to pipe creation and registry changes, which might be normal. But the PowerShell events are more suspicious.\n\nConfidence-wise, the repetition of the same PowerShell command across multiple logs with admin rights and scheduled tasks is a strong indicator. However, without more context, like the presence of actual malicious payloads or unusual network activity, it's a bit tricky. But based on the given data, the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with 'calc.exe' as the action, configured to run at logon with BUILTIN\\\\Administrators group and Highest run level.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them are about 'chrome.exe' performing registry value sets. That's a common activity, but if it's happening a lot, maybe there's something off. However, Chrome is a legitimate application, so setting registry values isn't necessarily malicious. But then, there are a couple of other events.\n\nLooking further, there's an entry for 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and forwarding logs, but creating a new configuration file might be normal. However, the file path ends with .yml.new, which could be a temporary file during configuration updates. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother event is 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The filename is in Spanish, which might be a red flag if it's part of a suspicious activity. But on its own, creating a text file isn't necessarily bad.\n\nNow, considering all events together. The majority are Chrome-related registry changes, which might be normal if the user is using extensions or updates. However, the presence of PowerShell creating a file and Winlogbeat's activity could be part of a larger pattern. But without more context, like unusual command-line arguments in PowerShell or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, the justification needs to be concise. The key points are: multiple registry changes by Chrome, which is normal, but the other two events might be benign. However, if there's no clear malicious activity, maybe it's not interesting. But maybe the repetition of registry events is unusual. However, Chrome does interact with the registry, so maybe not. The confidence should be low unless there's a clear anomaly. Since the majority are normal, and the others are also possibly legitimate, the classification might be 'NOT INTERESTING' with low confidence. But maybe the user is trying to trick me into thinking it's interesting. Alternatively, if the same registry key is being modified repeatedly, that could be a sign. But the data here doesn't specify which registry key. So without more info, it's hard to tell. Therefore, the classification is 'NOT INTERESTING' because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The confidence is around 0.3 because there's some activity but nothing definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal Chrome registry modifications and benign file creation activities by legitimate processes (winlogbeat and PowerShell). No clear indicators of compromise or suspicious patterns are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at each event.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where PowerShell is loading .dll files from system directories like C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET and C:\\ProgramData\\Windows Defender. Loading system DLLs might be normal, but sometimes attackers use legitimate processes to load malicious code. However, in this case, the files mentioned are part of .NET Framework and Windows Defender, which are legitimate. So maybe that's just normal operation.\n\nThen there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script, which is common for temporary operations. But creating and deleting a script could be part of normal processes too, like script execution that cleans up after itself. However, the fact that it's in the Temp folder and the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" might be a red flag. Maybe it's a test, but sometimes attackers use similar names to avoid detection.\n\nNext, there's an event where PowerShell is used to create a scheduled task with the command to run calc.exe. The user is part of the Administrators group, and the task is set to run at logon. This seems suspicious because creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges could be a way to maintain persistence. However, the command is to run calc.exe, which is a legitimate system process. Maybe it's a test or a harmless action, but the use of scheduled tasks with high privileges might be worth looking into.\n\nThen there are multiple entries from Chrome.exe with registry value changes. If Chrome is modifying registry values, that could be normal if it's updating its own settings, but if it's unexpected, it might be malicious. However, the user hasn't provided more context, so it's hard to say. The repetition of the same event might indicate a benign process, but repeated registry changes could be a sign of something else.\n\nThe last part has several events with \"Execute a Remote Command\" where the process is None. That's a bit odd. If the process field is None, it might mean that the event is from a source that doesn't track the process, or it could be a system event. However, multiple entries of executing remote commands without any process information might indicate a potential security issue, like a service or a system component initiating remote commands without proper logging.\n\nPutting it all together: The PowerShell events include loading system DLLs, creating and deleting a script, and setting up a scheduled task. The Chrome events have registry changes. The remote command executions are unattributed. While some of these might be normal, the combination of creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges, the presence of the Temp script, and the unattributed remote commands could indicate suspicious activity. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence might be around 0.65, leaning towards interesting because of the potential for persistence and unattributed commands, but not certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events involve loading system DLLs and creating\/deleting temporary scripts, which could indicate legitimate operations or potential malicious activity. A scheduled task is created to run calc.exe with elevated privileges, which may be benign but warrants investigation. Unattributed 'Execute a Remote Command' events also raise concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if there's any suspicious activity. The user provided a bunch of JSON events, most of them have \"winlog\" with tasks like \"Execute a Remote Command\" and some registry changes, file creations.\n\nFirst, looking at the first few entries: multiple entries with \"Execute a Remote Command\" but no process or file info. That might be normal if they're just logging commands, but repeated same events could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen, there's an entry with a process that's PowerShell executing a scheduled task. The command line shows creating a scheduled task with the action to run calc.exe, which is a common test application but can be a sign of malicious activity if unexpected. The user is set to Administrators group with high privileges, which is suspicious. That's a potential indicator of someone trying to run code with elevated rights.\n\nAnother entry mentions WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's part of Windows Task Scheduler, but if it's loading from an unexpected place, that could be bad. However, the path here is C:\\Windows\\System32, which is legitimate.\n\nThen there are several svchost.exe entries with registry value sets. svchost is a normal process, but if it's modifying registry keys, especially if it's not standard, that's concerning. However, without knowing the specific keys being changed, it's hard to tell.\n\nA file creation by svchost.exe at \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum\" – creating a task in System32's Tasks folder might be part of a scheduled task setup. If this is a legitimate task, it's okay, but if it's a new or unexpected task, that's suspicious. The name \"unidade_comum\" doesn't ring a bell as a standard task.\n\nThen, PowerShell creating a file in the user's AppData folder. That's common for some legitimate scripts, but if combined with other suspicious activities, it could be part of something malicious.\n\nChrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate DLLs related to antivirus and security features. However, if Chrome is loading them from an unusual path, that might be a sign of tampering. The paths here are standard, though.\n\nThe winlogbeat process creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file is normal during setup. The file path seems to be in a download directory, which might be part of a user's setup, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The PowerShell scheduled task creation with elevated privileges is a red flag. Creating a scheduled task that runs calc.exe might be a test, but in a real scenario, that's often a sign of someone trying to execute code under admin rights. Combined with multiple registry changes and file creations, especially in system directories, this could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious code. However, some of these events could be benign, like normal system operations or user-initiated actions. But the presence of the scheduled task with admin rights and the repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" events make me lean towards \"INTERESTING\" as the classification. The confidence isn't 100% because some events might be legitimate, but the combination does raise suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity, including PowerShell executing a scheduled task with elevated privileges (Administrators group), creation of a suspicious scheduled task named 'unidade_comum', and repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks.
