{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check for any suspicious patterns.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The names look like they're minified, which is common for legitimate Office add-ins or resources. But then again, malicious scripts can also be minified. \n\nWait, but there's a lot of repetition here. The same files are being created multiple times. For example, officeaicopilot-strings.min_26fa9ed3...js appears twice. That might be normal if the process is creating files and then creating them again, maybe due to some error or retry. But maybe not. Also, the process SDXHelper.exe is involved here. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, related to solution packages. So, if it's creating these files in the expected directory, it might be legitimate.\n\nHowever, the fact that there are so many files being created with similar names and paths might be a red flag. Could this be part of a larger download or installation? But the user mentioned that the batch should be considered as a whole. Let me check the other events. There's one event where the process is null and the task is Security Group Management. That seems unrelated. Another event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory, which is probably a legitimate activity if someone is setting up Winlogbeat. \n\nBut focusing back on the SDXHelper.exe events. The files are all in the Office SolutionPackages folder, which is a place where Office might store add-ins or packages. The filenames include 'officeaicopilot-strings.min', which suggests they might be related to the AI Copilot feature in Office. If this is part of an update or installation, it might be normal. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could indicate something wrong. Maybe the process is trying to overwrite files or there's an error in the file creation process. Alternatively, it could be a legitimate process that's being run multiple times.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the hash of the files. If the hashes are consistent, it might be a legitimate file. But since the logs don't include hashes, I can't verify that. Also, the user hasn't mentioned any other events that might indicate compromise, like unusual network activity or process execution.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the majority of events are from a legitimate process creating files in a legitimate directory, even though there's repetition. The other events are unrelated. However, the repetition might still be a sign of something unusual. But without more context, like the presence of other malicious activities, it's hard to say. The confidence here is moderate. Maybe around 0.6. It's not a clear-cut case of malicious activity, but there's enough oddness to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical files with minified JavaScript names are created repeatedly by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office directories, which may indicate unusual behavior or potential tampering, though SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate Office process.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of some package or update, given the hashes in the filenames.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior or something suspicious. SDXHelper.exe – I'm not entirely sure what that is, but maybe it's a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office? The files are being created in the AppData folder under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. That seems like a place where Office might store temporary or update files. However, the repetition of the same filenames multiple times might be a red flag. Wait, looking at the entries, each file is created twice. But maybe that's just because the system is logging each creation event, and the same file is being created multiple times? Or perhaps it's a loop or a script that's creating duplicates.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the nature of the files. They're all JavaScript files, which are common in web applications. However, in the context of Office, maybe they're part of some add-in or copilot feature? The filename includes \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\", which might relate to a copilot feature's language strings. If that's a legitimate part of an Office update, then maybe this is normal. But if these files are being created by a malicious process, that's a problem.\n\nBut wait, the process is SDXHelper.exe. If that's a legitimate process, then maybe this is just part of a normal update or installation. However, if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, that could be an indicator of something malicious. I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate file. From what I recall, Microsoft Office does have some helper executables, but I'm not certain if SDXHelper.exe is one of them. Alternatively, it could be a part of a third-party software or a malware.\n\nAnother angle is the path. The files are in the SolutionPackages directory, which might be used for storing solution packages. If the user is installing or updating Office, this could be part of that process. However, the fact that multiple files are being created with similar names but different hashes might indicate that they are different versions or parts of a larger package. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe repetition of the same events might not be significant if they are just duplicates of the same action. However, if the same file is being created multiple times in quick succession, that could be a sign of something wrong, like a loop or a malicious payload. But in the given data, each file is listed twice, which might be due to the logging mechanism capturing the event twice, or the process creating the file twice.\n\nConsidering all this, the key points are: the process name, the location of the files, and the nature of the files. If SDXHelper.exe is legitimate and the files are part of a legitimate Office update, then this is not interesting. If SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, or if the files are not part of a known update, then this could be suspicious. However, without more information on the process's legitimacy, it's a bit tricky. But given that the files are in a Microsoft Office directory and the process name includes \"Helper,\" it's possible that this is a legitimate activity, albeit perhaps part of an unusual update or installation. However, the high number of files created might still be worth investigating further to confirm their legitimacy.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files with similar names (officeaicopilot-strings.min_...) are created by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files located in a specific path under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The filenames have a pattern: officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by a hash. The same file paths are repeated multiple times, which might indicate that the same files are being created multiple times, but maybe that's part of a normal process.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe – I should check if that's a legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the Office Deployment Tool. It's used for installing or updating Office, so creating files in the SolutionPackages directory sounds normal. However, the repetition of the same files being created might be a red flag. But wait, maybe it's just the same file being created multiple times during installation or updates. Also, the hash in the filename could be versioning, so different hashes might mean different versions.\n\nThen there are two entries involving chrome.exe with registry value set events. Chrome modifying the registry isn't unusual, but combined with the SDXHelper activity, it might be worth looking into. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nAnother thing to consider: are there any other processes involved? The logs only mention SDXHelper.exe and chrome.exe. If SDXHelper is legitimate, then the file creations might be normal. But if SDXHelper is compromised, maybe it's downloading malicious files. However, the filenames here are JavaScript files, which are common in legitimate Office updates. The path is in the AppData folder, which is typical for user-specific data, so that's expected.\n\nWait, but the files are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. Maybe these are part of an Office add-in or a copilot feature. The name \"officeaicopilot\" suggests it's related to Microsoft's AI Copilot feature, which might be part of a legitimate update. If that's the case, then these events are normal.\n\nHowever, the same file being created multiple times might be a sign of something wrong. Like, if a process is repeatedly creating the same file, maybe it's a loop or a failed installation. But looking at the entries, each file has a different hash in the name, so they are different files. So maybe it's just multiple files being created as part of an update process.\n\nAlso, the confidence level. Since all the files are in a legitimate directory and the process is associated with Microsoft Office, it's more likely to be normal. Unless there's a known malicious activity associated with SDXHelper.exe, which I'm not aware of. But I should check if SDXHelper is a known legitimate process. Yes, it's part of the Office deployment tool, so that's legitimate.\n\nSo putting it all together: the events are likely part of a normal Office update or installation process. The repetition of file creation might be due to multiple files being created, not the same file. Therefore, this batch is probably not interesting for investigation. But I need to be careful here. If there were other suspicious activities, like network connections to unknown IPs or other processes, but in this case, there's nothing else. So the classification would be NOT INTERESTING with moderate confidence, maybe around 0.6. But wait, the user might be expecting higher confidence. Let me think again. Since the process is legitimate and the files are in the correct location, the confidence is higher. Maybe 0.7 or 0.8. But since the same files are created multiple times, but the hashes differ, it's still normal. So I think NOT INTERESTING is the right classification here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate SDXHelper.exe process creating JavaScript files in expected Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames follow a pattern consistent with Office add-in resources (officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxx.js), and no anomalous behavior or suspicious artifacts are detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with a pattern like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by a hash. The paths are all under the user's AppData folder, which is common for some applications, but the repetition and the number of files might be a red flag. \n\nWait, there are multiple entries for the same file being created multiple times. Like the first two entries are the same file. Then another one, then another, and so on. That's a lot of files being created by SDXHelper.exe. But why so many? Also, the names of the files include \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" which might be related to some legitimate Office add-in or update, but the hash part is usually used for unique identifiers. \n\nBut then, looking at the other events, there's also svchost.exe and chrome.exe loading BitsProxy.dll. BitsProxy.dll is part of the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS), which is a legitimate Windows component. However, if it's being loaded by unexpected processes, that could be a sign of something malicious. But in this case, svchost.exe and chrome.exe are both legitimate processes. So maybe that's normal.\n\nBut the main thing here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe. Now, SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, but if it's creating a lot of files in the SolutionPackages directory, that might be part of normal operations. However, the number of files here is quite high. Let me count: there are 17 entries, each creating a different file, but some entries are duplicates for the same file. Wait, no, looking again, each entry is a separate file, but the same file is created multiple times. For example, the first file is created twice, then another one twice, etc. So there are 8 unique files, each created twice except for one which is created once. Wait, no, let me check again:\n\nLooking at the paths, the first entry is officeaicopilot-strings.min_01b1c4d03464acf87b14647f4dc2c34f.js, then the same file again. Then another one, min_02a2560b947a8f251a45d63c493eb31b.js, again twice. Then min_0564746a9f4167a741ab562d41fd75fc.js twice, min_09a961493b3b65725c4aa7d85aa6ec2b.js twice, min_0baa481369488cbce9c3d5207010a50d.js twice, min_0d1ad4f1e67587dbd451127cb72e2305.js twice, min_1357e701c4eede15cade11e657b486a6.js twice, and min_1444839d33dbd032e97e946723d18d56.js once. So that's 8 unique files, with some created twice, and one once. So total of 17 entries. \n\nBut why is SDXHelper.exe creating so many files? Maybe it's part of a legitimate update or package installation. However, the fact that these files are in the Office SolutionPackages directory might be normal for some Office add-ins. But the repetition of the same file being created multiple times could be suspicious. However, the same file being created multiple times could be due to multiple processes or retries. \n\nAlternatively, maybe these files are not legitimate. The names include \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\", which might be related to the Office AI Copilot feature, but if these files are being created in a non-standard way, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother point is that all these events are from the same user, fiddelis, and all files are in their AppData folder. That's a common location for user-specific data, so it's not necessarily suspicious. \n\nBut considering that the same process is creating multiple files with unique hashes, maybe it's part of a legitimate package deployment. However, the high number of files and the repetition might be a sign of something else. \n\nOn the other hand, the other events involving svchost.exe and chrome.exe loading BitsProxy.dll are normal. So the main point of interest here is the SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files. \n\nBut how common is it for SDXHelper.exe to create so many files? If this is a normal operation, then it's not interesting. If it's unusual, then it might be. But without knowing the baseline behavior, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that there are so many files created by the same process might be a red flag. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this is part of a legitimate Office update or installation. However, the repetition of the same file being created multiple times might be a mistake in the log or a sign of a problem. \n\nIn the absence of more information, the high number of file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a short period could be suspicious, but it's not definitive. Therefore, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" with a moderate confidence, as there's a possibility of malicious activity, but it's not certain. However, given that the files are in a legitimate directory and the process is known, it might be on the lower side of confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files with similar names (officeaicopilot-strings.min_...) are created repeatedly by SDXHelper.exe in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory.

SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, right? It's involved in handling add-ins or solutions. The SolutionPackages folder is where Office stores add-in packages, so creating files there might be part of installing or updating an add-in.

If these files are being created by SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process, but if there's an unusual number of files or if they're being created in a non-standard way, that could be a red flag.\n\nBut wait, the justification here is that the files are created by SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, all showing that the SDXHelper.exe process is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names that start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a bunch of alphanumeric characters and a .js extension.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, right? It's involved in installing or updating solutions. But creating so many JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory... Hmm. Normally, when Office updates or installs add-ins, it might place some files there, but the repetition of the same file names with different hashes makes me think something's off. Wait, the file names have different hashes each time. That could be a sign of multiple files being created, but maybe they're just different versions or parts of the same package. However, the fact that they're all being created by SDXHelper.exe might be normal if it's part of a legitimate update process.\n\nBut wait, the same file is being created multiple times. Looking at the entries, each file is logged twice. For example, the first entry is for min_b20b0a77f6fe2ec72ac3e8fa6d33e875.js, and then it's repeated. That might be a duplicate log entry, but maybe it's just the same file being created twice. However, the timestamps might be different, but since we don't have timestamps here, it's hard to tell. The repetition could be normal if the process is writing the same file multiple times, but that's not typical for a legitimate process.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the path. The files are in the OfflineFiles directory, which is used for storing files that are not connected to the network. If this is part of an offline installation or update, that might make sense. But the sheer number of files being created could be suspicious. Office typically doesn't create dozens of JavaScript files in that directory during normal operations.\n\nAlso, the names of the files are similar, all starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\". The \"aicopilot\" part might be a reference to a specific feature or add-in. However, if this is a legitimate update, the files should be part of a known package. But without more context, like the version of Office or the specific update being applied, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother angle: SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's being used to create a large number of files in a non-standard way, that could indicate malicious activity. However, the fact that all the events are related to file creation and not other suspicious activities (like registry changes, network connections, etc.) makes me think it's more likely to be a legitimate process, albeit perhaps part of a large update or package installation.\n\nBut wait, the same file is being created multiple times. If the same file is created twice, maybe there's a loop or an error in the process. However, without more information, it's hard to tell. The confidence here is a bit low because the events alone don't provide enough context. The repetition might be normal, or it might not be. Since the user is asking if this batch is interesting for investigation, I need to determine if there's enough evidence to flag it.\n\nIn conclusion, while the events are not definitively malicious, the repeated creation of similar files by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard directory might warrant further investigation. The confidence is moderate, around 0.6, because it's not a clear-cut case but there are enough anomalies to be cautious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard Office directory, potentially indicating unusual behavior or a possible tampering attempt.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min_js with different hashes. Now, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's used for installing add-ins or solutions. So creating files in the SolutionPackages folder might be normal during an Office add-in installation. But why are there so many files being created with different hashes? That might be a red flag. Typically, an add-in might not generate that many files with varying hashes. It could be a sign of something malicious trying to drop multiple files.\n\nThen there's the chrome.exe process. One event shows a registry value set, which isn't immediately suspicious. Another event shows chrome loading urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows component, and MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender. So those might be normal activities. But if chrome was involved in something malicious, maybe that's a sign. However, just loading those DLLs doesn't indicate a problem. \n\nNow, the repetition of the same file creation events by SDXHelper.exe. Each file is created twice, which might be a normal process, but the number of unique files is high. Also, the filenames are JavaScript files, which could be part of a legitimate add-in, but could also be used to inject malicious code. However, the path is within the Office SolutionPackages directory, which is a known location for Office add-ins. \n\nBut here's the thing: Microsoft Office add-ins usually don't generate so many JavaScript files with different hashes. That's more indicative of a malicious payload being deployed. Additionally, the fact that the same file is created multiple times might be an attempt to overwrite or replace files, but that's just a guess. \n\nAnother point is that the user might be using a legitimate process, but the volume and pattern of these file creations could be unusual. However, without more context, like other events or known bad indicators, it's tricky. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that the events are in JSONL format, and I need to consider the entire batch. So the main points are: multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory, same files created twice, and other processes like chrome.exe doing normal things. \n\nConsidering all that, the high number of file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a location associated with Office add-ins could be legitimate, but the repetition and number might be suspicious. However, without more evidence like unusual network activity, process injections, or known malicious hashes, it's hard to be certain. \n\nSo, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6, because while the events are not definitively malicious, the pattern is unusual and could warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory with varying hash suffixes, which may indicate unusual activity during add-in installation or potential malicious payload deployment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about chrome.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That seems a bit odd because Chrome usually doesn't interact with Defender's files. But maybe it's a legitimate process, like a security check or something.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. These files have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min... which might be related to Office add-ins or copilot features. However, creating multiple JavaScript files in that location could be suspicious, especially if they're being generated by a helper process. But I need to check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. Maybe it's part of Office's installation or updates.\n\nNext, chrome.exe is setting registry values multiple times. Changing registry values can be a red flag, but again, Chrome might do this for updates or configuration changes. However, repeated registry modifications without clear context might indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking at the file paths, the JavaScript files are in the Office package resources. If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate Microsoft process, then creating these files might be normal. But if it's a third-party or malicious process, that's a problem. Also, the repeated creation of similar files with different hashes might suggest some kind of injection or tampering.\n\nThen there are events related to a downloaded Excel file, Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. Chrome is creating streams and zone identifiers for this file. Zone.Identifier is usually created when a file is downloaded from the internet to mark it as coming from a different zone (like the internet). That's normal, but maybe the file is being manipulated here. However, there's no direct indication of malicious activity yet.\n\nThe DNS query from chrome.exe is normal for browsing, but without more context on the domain, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious part is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in the Office directory. If SDXHelper.exe is legitimate, this might be part of a normal process. However, if it's not, this could be malicious. The Chrome events, while a bit unusual, don't show clear signs of malware. The presence of multiple file creations and registry changes could be part of a larger attack, but without more evidence like network traffic to malicious IPs or unusual process behavior, it's hard to confirm.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash-like strings. Now, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's used for various helper tasks. But creating a bunch of JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles folder... Hmm. Office usually doesn't generate a lot of JS files in that location. Maybe it's related to some add-in or update, but the repetition of the same file names with different hashes makes me think maybe something's off. Are these files part of a legitimate update, or is this an indicator of malicious activity?\n\nThen there's chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a normal system DLL. Not suspicious. Also, winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. That seems like a normal operation when setting up a tool. The EXCEL.EXE process opening an Excel file and loading combase.dll, which is also a standard system component. Nothing there.\n\nBut going back to the SDXHelper.exe events. The fact that it's creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office directory, especially with those hashes, might be a red flag. Malware sometimes uses JavaScript files for malicious purposes, like executing code or downloading payloads. However, Office might use JS files for some legitimate reasons too, like embedded scripts in documents. But the key point here is that the files are being created in the OfflineFiles directory, which is typically used for storing resources that are used when the user is offline. If these files are being generated by SDXHelper.exe, which is a helper process, maybe it's part of a legitimate Office operation. However, the volume and the specific naming might indicate something else.\n\nWait, the same file names are appearing multiple times, but with different hashes. That could be normal if they're different versions, but maybe not. Also, the path includes \"SolutionPackages\" which is a folder that might be used by Office for add-ins or solutions. If these files are part of an add-in, maybe that's why they're being created. However, without additional context, like user interaction or known good sources, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother thing to consider: are there any other processes or events that might indicate compromise? The other events seem normal. The only other thing is the Registry value set by chrome.exe, but that's not enough to be suspicious. Also, the EXCEL.EXE process is just opening a file, which is normal.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the majority of events are normal, but the repeated creation of JavaScript files by SDXHelper.exe in the Office directory might be worth investigating. It's not a clear-cut malicious activity, but it's unusual enough that a security analyst might want to look into it further.

That alone might not be suspicious, but the rest of the logs show a lot of file creation events by SDXHelper.exe. The files being created are all JavaScript files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames have patterns like \"am-et-ui-strings-json\" and others with different language codes. \n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's used for managing solutions and add-ins. But creating so many JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles folder might be normal if they're part of a package. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could indicate something. Wait, looking at the entries, some files are logged twice. Maybe that's just a duplication in the log, but maybe the process is creating the same files repeatedly, which isn't typical.\n\nAlso, there are events from EXCEL.EXE creating a temporary Excel file and loading some DLLs. The Zone.Identifier streams are normal for marking files as coming from the internet, but the repeated creation of the same Excel file might be part of a legitimate process. However, the main concern here is the SDXHelper.exe activity. \n\nNow, considering that the files are all UI string resources for different languages, maybe this is part of an Office add-in or localization package. But the large number of files and the repetition might be a red flag. However, without more context like unusual processes or network activity, it's hard to say. The classification here is tricky. The logs don't show obvious malicious activity like unexpected processes or access to sensitive files. The presence of SDXHelper.exe is expected in an Office environment. \n\nBut the user is asking if this batch is interesting for investigation.

That path seems a bit odd. Usually, Office apps might use temporary files, but creating a JS file there could be suspicious. Maybe it's part of a macro or some malicious script?\n\nThen there are multiple entries about EXCEL.EXE loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll. These are legitimate system files, so loading them is normal. But I notice that some of these are loaded multiple times. Not sure if that's a red flag yet.\n\nThere's a file created and then immediately deleted: ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. The tilde and dollar sign suggest it's an auto-save or temporary file from Excel. The creation and deletion might be normal, but sometimes malware creates and deletes files quickly to avoid detection. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe svchost.exe entries show registry value sets. svchost is a common host process, and registry changes could be normal or part of a compromise. But multiple registry events from svchost might indicate something, though not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the SDXHelper.exe again, it's creating JS files in the Office package directories. That's unusual because those directories are typically for Office solutions, and having JS files there might be part of a malicious add-in or exploit. Also, the same file path is repeated twice, which might be a sign of an error or repeated action.\n\nThe Pipe Created event under EXCEL.EXE could be normal for inter-process communication, but if there's a lot of such events, it might indicate something else.

Those might be system events without a specific process, which could be normal or part of a larger issue.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the SDXHelper.exe creating JS files in unexpected locations and the repeated file creation\/deletion in Excel.

Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and shipping logs, so that's probably normal. The file path seems to be part of an installation or configuration, like .winlogbeat.yml.new. That's probably just a temporary file during setup.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. SDXHelper isn't a familiar name to me. I should check if that's a legitimate process. Maybe it's part of Office, but the file names like fabric_9633a60e8aeb23f94615c4de4ed6ad04.js and others with random strings might be suspicious. However, Office sometimes uses such names for resources. But creating multiple files with similar names in different packages could be a red flag. Maybe it's part of a malicious payload or a legitimate update?\n\nWait, the same process is creating multiple files in different subdirectories. Also, the filenames have long hashes, which sometimes are used in malware to obfuscate names. However, Office might use such naming for localization or different language packs. But the repetition of the same process creating similar files might indicate something.\n\nThen there are events from Explorer.EXE and EXCEL.EXE related to registry changes and file creation. The EXCEL.EXE creating .LNK files in the Recent directory is normal, as Excel creates shortcuts when opening files. The registry events might be part of normal operations, but multiple registry value sets could be something else. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, looking for anomalies: The SDXHelper.exe process is creating a lot of files in non-standard locations, which might be unusual. However, the user mentioned that the batch should be considered as a whole. The majority of events are from legitimate processes (winlogbeat, Excel, Explorer), but the SDXHelper.exe activity is repetitive and in possibly unexpected locations. However, without knowing what SDXHelper is, it's hard to say. Maybe it's a legitimate helper tool for Office, but the file paths and the number of events might be suspicious.\n\nWait, the same file is being created multiple times by SDXHelper. For example, fabric_9633...js is created twice, then another file is created twice, etc. That repetition might indicate that the process is trying to write the same files multiple times, which could be a sign of something wrong. But maybe it's just a normal process that's creating files in batches.\n\nAnother point: the first event is from winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. If that's part of a monitoring setup, it's normal. However, if there's no other log activity except for the SDXHelper, that might be a concern.

However, without more context, like known bad indicators or other malicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence here would be moderate. Maybe the system is just installing something, but the repetition and the process name could be a sign of something else.\n\nSo, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" because of the unusual process name and repetitive file creation, but not certain.

So, creating files in the SolutionPackages folder makes sense if it's part of a legitimate installation or update process.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many files being created? The same file paths are repeated multiple times. Maybe it's just a normal part of deploying multiple language packs or components.

However, the user's input shows that each event is the same, which might be a data duplication error, but assuming the data is correct, the process is creating multiple files in different subdirectories under SolutionPackages. \n\nAnother angle: the use of \"OfflineFiles\" in the path. Office might use that for offline installation components. The filenames with hashes (like f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2) might be unique identifiers for specific packages. If these are part of a legitimate deployment, then it's normal. However, if these files are not part of any known Office package, that could be suspicious. But without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nConsidering that all events are from SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process, and the files are in expected directories, I think this is likely a normal installation or update process. The repetition of the same file entries might be due to logging each creation, but not necessarily malicious. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear sign of malicious activity. However, if the files are not part of any known Office package, that could be a red flag. But given the information provided, I don't have evidence of that. So, the confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6, because while the process is legitimate, the multiple file creations could be normal or could indicate something else.

So, all the entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and UI strings, like es-mx-ui-strings-json, et-ee-ui-strings-json, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? I remember that Office sometimes uses helper processes for various tasks, including installing or updating language packs or solutions. The paths mentioned are in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages folder, which seems like a legitimate location for Office-related files.\n\nLooking at the filenames, they all follow a pattern: language code (like es-mx for Spanish, et-ee for Estonian) followed by UI strings and a JSON extension. The hashes at the end of the filenames are unique identifiers, which makes sense for versioning or tracking specific packages. \n\nNow, the repetition of some files being created twice might be a red flag. However, if the same file is created multiple times, maybe it's part of a process that's retrying or handling multiple instances. But in this case, the same file is created twice in some entries. However, since all the events are FileCreate rules, it's possible that these are just multiple files being added as part of a package installation.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is known to create such files. If this is a normal operation, then it's not suspicious. However, if these files are not part of any legitimate Office installation or update, it could be malicious. But given the path and the process name, it's more likely related to Office. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the lack of other suspicious activities. There are no events indicating process injections, network connections, or privilege escalations. All events are just file creations. This suggests that the activity is confined to file operations, which might be part of a legitimate process like installing language packs or updates.\n\nHowever, the sheer number of files being created might be unusual. But considering that each entry is a different language pack, it could be that the user is installing multiple language packs for Office, which would explain the multiple file creations. \n\nIn conclusion, unless there's more context indicating that these files are not part of a legitimate Office operation, this seems like normal behavior.

The main thing here is to check for any suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory, specifically under OfflineFiles. The filenames look like they're language-specific UI strings, like fr-fr, ga-ie, etc. These seem like legitimate Office resources, maybe part of a language pack or some localization files. But why are they being created repeatedly? Wait, each file is being created twice, but maybe that's just duplicate entries in the log. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's one event where winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a tool used for collecting and shipping logs, so creating a config file might be normal if someone is setting it up. But the fact that it's in the Downloads folder could be a red flag. Typically, configuration files for services like Winlogbeat should be in their installation directories, not in Downloads. That might indicate someone manually placing the file there, which could be part of a setup or maybe a malicious attempt to configure the tool improperly.\n\nNow, looking at the process names: SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, so creating those UI files might be part of a legitimate Office update or installation. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be unusual. But maybe the logs are just capturing the same event twice. The other event with winlogbeat.exe is more concerning because it's a different process and the file path is in a user's Downloads folder, which is a common place for malware to drop files.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the lack of other suspicious activities. There's no mention of failed logins, unusual network activity, or process injections. All the events are about file creation, which is a normal activity but needs context. If these files are part of a legitimate Office installation, then it's not interesting. But if the files are unexpected or if there's a pattern that doesn't align with normal operations, that's a problem.\n\nHowever, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a config file in Downloads might be a sign of someone trying to configure it without proper setup, which could be benign if the user is setting it up. But without more context, like other events related to network traffic or unauthorized access, it's hard to say. The SDXHelper.exe events don't seem malicious on their own, but the combination with the winlogbeat event might be worth looking into.\n\nSo, considering all that, the batch has a mix of possibly normal activities and one event that's a bit out of place.

There are duplicates in the entries, which might just be repeated events.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior or something suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's used for package management or something related to Office solutions. Creating files in the SolutionPackages directory might be part of its normal operations, especially if it's handling resources for different languages (like hr for Croatian, hu for Hungarian, etc.). The file names suggest they are UI string resources, which are common in software for localization. \n\nBut wait, why are there so many files being created? The same file paths are logged multiple times. Maybe it's just logging each creation event, but if the files are being created repeatedly, that could be a sign of something else. However, considering the names and the directory structure, it seems like these are part of the Office solution's package resources. \n\nI should check if creating multiple files in that directory is typical. If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, then this might be normal. However, if there's an unusual number of files or if the files are in unexpected locations, that could be a red flag. But in this case, the paths seem to align with where Office might store its packages. \n\nAnother angle: the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Microsoft Office.

However, the logs don't provide context about the user's actions or other events that might indicate a compromise.\n\nThe key here is that all the events are related to file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory, and the files are named in a way that suggests they're part of a software package's resources. There's no indication of malicious activity like execution of suspicious files, network activity, or privilege escalation. The repetition of the same file creation events might just be redundant logging, not an actual security threat.\n\nSo, putting it all together, unless there's more context suggesting otherwise, these events seem to be part of normal Office operations.

The registry events could be normal system operations, but combined with the file creations, maybe there's something suspicious. However, svchost.exe is a common system process, so those events might not be malicious on their own.\n\nThe repeated creation of similar files by SDXHelper.exe could indicate a legitimate process, like installing language packs or updates for Office.

The first thing I notice is that there are a bunch of events where EXCEL.EXE is setting registry values. That's a lot of them—like seven entries all saying the same thing.

That might be normal if it's part of some legitimate process, but having so many identical events could indicate something's up. Maybe a script or malware is using Excel to make changes to the registry.\n\nThen, there are several entries where SDXHelper.exe is creating files in specific paths under the user's AppData directory, specifically within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The filenames look like they're related to UI strings in different languages, like kok-in, lb-lu, lo-la, etc. The filenames have hashes in them, which might be part of a legitimate package, but the sheer number of files being created could be a red flag.

The file path is under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages, which seems a bit unusual. Office typically doesn't store solution packages in the user's AppData, maybe? Or maybe it's part of some add-in or custom solution. But why would SDXHelper.exe be creating that file? I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office, maybe part of the Office Deployment Tool or something similar. But creating files in that directory might be normal for some operations. However, the same file is mentioned twice in the logs, so maybe it's a repeated action. But that's just two events.\n\nThen there are a bunch of events where EXCEL.EXE is setting registry values. There are 22 instances of EXCEL.EXE with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". That's a lot. Excel normally doesn't modify the registry very often, especially not 22 times. That seems suspicious. Malware sometimes modifies the registry to persist or change system behavior. But Excel could be doing this if it's part of some macro or add-in. However, 22 events in a row without any other context might indicate something malicious. \n\nNow, combining the two parts: SDXHelper creating a file and Excel modifying the registry multiple times. Are these related? Maybe the file created by SDXHelper is part of a malicious payload that then causes Excel to modify the registry. But without more information, like the content of the file or the specific registry keys being changed, it's hard to tell. However, the sheer number of registry events from Excel is a red flag. Legitimate software usually doesn't generate that many registry modification events in such a short time. \n\nAlso, the first event has \"task\":\"None\" which might be an error or a placeholder, but not sure. The rest of the events have specific tasks. The repetition of the same file creation by SDXHelper might be normal if it's part of a package installation, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nConsidering the confidence, the multiple registry modifications by Excel are more concerning. If this is a normal user activity, maybe they're running a script that modifies the registry, but that's less likely.

The process SDXHelper.exe is mentioned multiple times. I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is part of the Office Developer Tools, so it's a legitimate process. However, if it's creating a large number of files, especially in unusual locations or with unusual names, that might be suspicious. \n\nBut in this case, the files are named with language codes and UI strings, which seems normal for localization files. However, the same files are being created multiple times. For example, the mi-nz-ui-strings-json file is created twice with the same path. That might indicate a possible issue, like a loop or repeated attempts to create the same file. But maybe it's just a logging issue or the process is being called multiple times for different reasons.\n\nAnother event is from EXCEL.EXE setting a registry value. That's a normal activity for Excel, so probably not suspicious. \n\nNow, considering the confidence. The files are in expected locations, and the process is legitimate. However, the repetition might be worth investigating. But without more context, like other events or anomalies, it's hard to say.

That seems like a legitimate place for Office to store package resources.\n\nThe files being created are named with language codes like nb-no and ne-np, which are Norwegian and Nepali, respectively. The names include \"ui-strings-json\" which sounds like localization files. The random strings in the filenames might be hashes or unique identifiers for different versions or packages. \n\nBut why are there three entries? Wait, the second and third events are identical.
