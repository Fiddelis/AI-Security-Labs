So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is looking for any suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files located in the Office SolutionPackages directory. Now, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? So maybe it's related to some legitimate Office updates or packages. But then again, sometimes malware can masquerade as legitimate processes.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. The filenames have hashes in them, which might be part of the package's internal structure. But creating multiple JavaScript files with different hashes could be normal if it's part of a package deployment. However, the fact that there are so many files created by the same process might be a red flag. But wait, the same file is created multiple times. Like, officeaicopilot-strings.min_01b1c4d0...js is created twice. Maybe that's just a normal process, but maybe not.\n\nThen there are some ImageLoad events for BitsProxy.dll by svchost.exe and chrome.exe. BitsProxy.dll is part of the Background Intelligent Transfer Service, which is a legitimate Windows component. So those events might be normal.\n\nBut here's the thing: SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of files, and all of them are JavaScript files. If this were a legitimate Office update, maybe there would be a variety of file types, but all JavaScript files might be unusual. Also, the presence of multiple files with different hashes could indicate that something is trying to deploy a lot of content, which might be part of a malicious payload. However, without more context, like if the files are being executed or if there's network activity, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is that the user is named \"fiddelis\". I don't know if that's a real user or not, but maybe that's a red herring. Also, the files are in the AppData folder, which is common for both legitimate and malicious software.\n\nHmm, but the classification needs to be based on the entire batch. Since all the events are related to SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files, and there's no other suspicious activity like network connections, process injections, or unusual command-line arguments, maybe it's not malicious. However, the sheer number of files created could be indicative of something. But I'm not sure. Maybe the Office package is just large and requires many files. Alternatively, maybe this is a benign process, and the logs are just showing normal operations.\n\nWait, the justification needs to be concise. If there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, like the files being executed or the process being associated with known malware, then maybe it's not interesting. But the fact that SDXHelper.exe is creating so many files might still be worth investigating. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe the confidence should be around 0.5 or 0.6, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the files are all legitimate, then it's not interesting. But I don't have enough info to confirm that. So the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence because of the high volume of file creations by a single process, even though they are in a legitimate directory.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, all showing that the SDXHelper.exe process is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names that start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in managing solutions and add-ins. But creating so many JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory... Hmm. The path is under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages, which seems like a legitimate place for Office to store package resources. However, the fact that there are so many files being created with different hash values might be a red flag. \n\nWait, but Office might update its packages frequently, so maybe this is just part of a normal update process. However, the repetition of the same file names with different hashes could indicate that something is being written multiple times, perhaps in an attempt to overwrite or inject malicious code. But I need to check if these files are part of a known legitimate package. \n\nThe file names include \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\", which might relate to the AI Copilot feature in Office. If this is a legitimate update, then it's normal. However, the hashes are unique each time, which might be normal for different versions. But the same file being created multiple times with different hashes could be suspicious. \n\nAlternatively, maybe SDXHelper.exe is being used maliciously here. If the files are being created in a directory that's typically used for Office packages, but the process is not the usual Office process, that could be a problem. However, the process name is SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process. \n\nWait, but the user is asking if the batch is interesting for investigation. The key here is the number of events. There are 16 entries, all from the same process creating similar files. This could be a sign of a malicious actor trying to inject code or create a lot of files to evade detection. However, without more context, like other events or known bad indicators, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother angle: the fact that all these files are JavaScript and are in the OfflineFiles directory. If these files are meant to be used offline, maybe they're part of a legitimate setup. But creating so many of them might be unusual. However, considering that each entry is a duplicate in terms of the process and the file path (except for the hash), maybe it's just a normal operation. \n\nBut why are there duplicates? For example, the same file path is logged twice with the same hash. That might be a normal part of the process, like writing a file and then another, but if it's the same file, that's odd. Wait, looking at the JSONs, each event has a different hash in the file name. So each file is unique. That might be part of different package versions or different resources. \n\nHowever, the confidence here is tricky. If I don't have any other indicators, like network connections, process anomalies, or user interactions, then this might be a false positive. But the sheer number of files created by a single process could be a sign of something. \n\nIn the absence of other suspicious activities, maybe this is not interesting. But I'm not entirely sure. The justification would be that the files are in a legitimate directory, created by a legitimate process, but the high number of files might be normal for updates. However, the repetition of the same file name pattern with different hashes could be suspicious. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the hashes are just different versions, and the process is just updating the package. Without more context, I'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence. However, I'm not 100% certain. Maybe the confidence should be around 0.5. But I need to check if there's any known malicious activity related to SDXHelper.exe creating these files. \n\nSince I don't have that information, and the events don't show other malicious signs, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification that it's likely part of normal Office package operations, but the high number of events could be a red flag.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, looking at the events, there's a lot of file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all named similarly, with different hashes in the filenames. Then there are a couple of registry events from chrome.exe.\n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe... I know that's part of Microsoft's Office solution, maybe related to updates or installations. But creating multiple files with different hashes in the OfflineFiles folder? That might be normal if it's part of a package deployment. However, the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times could be a red flag. Wait, but looking at the paths, they're all under the same package directory. Maybe it's just installing multiple resources as part of a legitimate update.\n\nBut why so many files? Let me think. Office 365 or newer versions might have a lot of resources. However, the presence of multiple files with different hashes might indicate that they're different versions or parts of the same package. But if these files are being created by SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process, maybe it's just part of a normal installation. \n\nHowever, the fact that the same file is being created twice in some entries. Wait, looking at the first two entries, the same file path is logged twice. Is that possible? Maybe the system is logging each creation event, even if it's the same file. But that's normal if the process is creating the file multiple times. Or maybe there's a loop or a script that's generating these files repeatedly.\n\nWait, but the justification for being interesting would be if there's suspicious activity. If SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of files in a user's AppData folder, that might be unusual. But Office applications often store data in AppData. However, the specific path here is under SolutionPackages, which might be related to Office add-ins or solutions. \n\nAnother point: the files are JavaScript files, like officeaicopilot-strings.min... These might be part of a copilot feature or some UI strings. But if they're being created in the OfflineFiles directory, maybe they're being cached. However, the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times might be a sign of something. But looking at the timestamps, if they're all from the same time, maybe it's a bulk operation.\n\nAlso, there are two registry events from chrome.exe. That might be unrelated, but could indicate that Chrome is modifying registry values. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the main focus here is the SDXHelper.exe activity.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if the entire batch is interesting. So, considering that SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but creating many files with different hashes in a short period might be part of a normal update. However, the fact that the same file is being created multiple times (like the first entry's file being logged twice) might not be a big deal if it's part of the same package deployment. \n\nAlternatively, if this is part of a malicious activity, like downloading files in chunks and saving them as separate files, but the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is legitimate. So maybe it's not interesting. But I need to be cautious. \n\nAnother angle: the hash parts of the filenames are unique, which might be normal for different files. However, if the same file is being created multiple times, that's a different story. But looking at the entries, each file has a unique hash in the name. So each entry is a different file. So the repetition is just multiple files being created, not the same file. So maybe that's normal.\n\nIn that case, the events might be part of a legitimate Office update or installation. The presence of chrome.exe modifying the registry might be unrelated. So the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities are consistent with normal software operations. However, I should check if there's any other suspicious pattern. \n\nWait, but the same process (SDXHelper.exe) creating multiple files in a specific directory could be a sign of something. But without more context, like other processes or anomalies, it's hard to say. Since the user is asking for a classification based on the entire batch, and there's no other suspicious activity (like network connections, unexpected processes, etc.), it's likely not interesting. \n\nTherefore, the confidence would be around 0.4, as there's some unusual activity but it could be legitimate. However, I might be underestimating. Alternatively, maybe the confidence is lower because the activities are within a legitimate process's scope. So, the justification would be that the events are part of a legitimate Office update process, creating resource files in the expected directory.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which aligns with legitimate Office resource deployment.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events here are about files being created, specifically by the SDXHelper.exe process. The files are all JavaScript files named officeaicopilot-strings.min with different hashes in the filename. They're located in the Office SolutionPackages directory. Now, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's used for managing add-ins or something like that. But creating a bunch of JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles folder... Hmm, that might be normal if it's part of an Office update or package deployment. However, the repetition of the same file names with different hashes could be a red flag. Wait, but looking at the paths, they all seem to be under the same package directory. Maybe it's just a lot of resource files being copied there.\n\nWait, but there's also an entry where the process is null and the task is \"Security Group Management.\" That might be a separate event, maybe related to user or group changes, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the main bulk of the logs are the file creations by SDXHelper.exe. \n\nNow, the question is whether this is suspicious. If SDXHelper.exe is legitimately creating these files as part of Office's normal operations, then it's not interesting. But if these files are being created in a way that's not typical, like in unusual locations or with unusual names, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, the filenames here seem to be minified JavaScript files, which are common in web applications. The Office add-in might be using these files, so maybe it's normal.\n\nBut wait, the fact that there are multiple entries for the same file being created multiple times could indicate a loop or repeated actions. However, looking at the timestamps (though they aren't provided here), if they are all within a short time frame, that might be suspicious. But since the user hasn't provided timestamps, I can't say for sure. \n\nAnother point is that the files are stored in the OfflineFiles directory. Maybe that's where Office stores cached resources. If that's the case, then this is normal. However, if the files are being written to a location that's not typical for Office, that could be a problem. \n\nAlso, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory is normal, as it's part of log collection. That's not suspicious.\n\nSo, considering all this, the main question is whether the repeated creation of these JavaScript files by SDXHelper.exe is normal. If the system is running Office updates or add-ins that require these files, then it's not interesting. However, if there's no legitimate reason for these files to be created in that manner, it might be a sign of malicious activity. But without more context, like the system's normal behavior, it's hard to tell. \n\nGiven that the files are all under the Office directory and the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Office, I'm leaning towards this being a normal process. However, the high number of files created might still be worth investigating, especially if it's unexpected. But since the user hasn't indicated any other anomalies, maybe it's not interesting. \n\nWait, but the classification should be based on whether the batch is relevant for investigation. If the logs are just normal activity, then it's not interesting. But if there's a pattern that could indicate something malicious, even if not certain, it might be interesting. \n\nIn this case, the repetition of the same file names with different hashes might be a sign of something, but it could also be different versions of the same resource. Without more info, it's hard to say. However, since the process is a legitimate one and the files are in a legitimate directory, I think the confidence is low. \n\nSo, the justification would be that the events are related to legitimate Office operations, even though the number of files is high. Therefore, classification is NOT INTERESTING with low confidence, but maybe medium. Wait, but the confidence should be between 0 and 1. If I'm not sure, maybe 0.4. But if the system is known to have Office installed, then it's normal. However, without knowing the system's context, it's safer to say it's not interesting. Alternatively, maybe it's interesting because the same process is creating multiple files in a short time. But again, without timestamps, it's hard to tell. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think the safest bet is to classify it as NOT INTERESTING, with a confidence around 0.4, because the process is legitimate, and the files are in the expected directory.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries related to chrome.exe and SDXHelper.exe. The chrome.exe events include things like image loaded, registry value sets, and file stream creations. One of the image loaded events points to a file in the Windows Defender directory, which is a bit suspicious because that's a system directory. However, the file mentioned, MpClient.dll, is part of Windows Defender, so maybe that's legitimate. But I should check if there are any anomalies here.\n\nThen there are several entries for SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files named officeaicopilot-strings.min with different hashes. These could be part of a legitimate Office add-in or solution package. However, the repetition of these file creation events might indicate something. If these files are being created multiple times, maybe there's an attempt to inject malicious code or modify the Office environment. \n\nLooking at the chrome.exe events, there's also a DNS query, which is normal, but combined with the registry changes and file creations, it might be part of a larger pattern. The registry value sets could be modifying settings that allow the malicious files to execute or persist. \n\nAnother point is the file stream creation for the Excel file \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\" and its Zone.Identifier. Zone.Identifier is used by Windows to mark files downloaded from the internet, so creating that stream might be part of the download process. However, if there are multiple streams created, it could be an indicator of something trying to manipulate the file's properties.\n\nPutting this all together, the key points are the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a potentially sensitive directory, the registry modifications by chrome.exe, and the unusual number of file stream creations. However, without more context, like the presence of malware signatures or unusual network activity, it's a bit hard to say. But considering the combination of these events, especially the repeated file creations in Office directories and the registry changes, there's a possibility of a legitimate activity versus a potential threat. \n\nI need to weigh the likelihood. If these are part of a legitimate Office update or add-in, then it's not interesting. But if the files are malicious or the registry changes are unauthorized, then it's a concern. Since the files are named with min.js and are in the SolutionPackages, they might be part of a legitimate package. However, the repetition and the combination with chrome.exe's activities might be red flags. \n\nConfidence here is a bit low because there's not enough evidence of malicious intent, but the combination of events is unusual enough to warrant further investigation.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by looking through the data.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash. The paths are all under the user's AppData folder, which is common for temporary files or application data. However, the fact that so many files are being created by SDXHelper.exe might be suspicious. SDXHelper is part of Microsoft Office, right? So maybe it's related to some legitimate activity, like updates or package installations. But creating so many files with similar names could indicate something else.\n\nWait, but looking at the file names, they all have \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" which might be part of a legitimate Office add-in or something related to the AI copilot feature. However, the repetition and the number of files might be a red flag. Also, the hashes in the filenames are different each time, which could be normal if they're different versions, but if they're all part of the same process, maybe that's not the case.\n\nThen there's an entry with chrome.exe setting a registry value and another where it loads urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll. The registry event might be normal, but the image load events for those DLLs are part of Chrome's normal operation, so probably not suspicious.\n\nBut the main point here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe. If this is part of a legitimate Office update or package installation, it might be okay. However, if SDXHelper is being used to inject malicious files, that's a problem. But how can I tell? The filenames don't seem to have obvious malicious indicators like .exe or .bat extensions. They're all .js files, which could be scripts. However, JavaScript files in AppData could be part of legitimate processes or could be malicious.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the same files are being created multiple times. For example, the first two entries are the same file path. Maybe that's a duplicate log entry, but maybe the process is creating the same file multiple times, which could be unusual. However, it's possible that the logs are capturing multiple events related to the same file, like different operations or multiple creations.\n\nI should also check if the process SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office and is used for various tasks, including handling solution packages. So, if the files are part of Office's solution packages, they might be legitimate. However, the presence of multiple files with similar names and the fact that they're being created in the OfflineFiles directory might be part of a normal update process.\n\nBut considering that there are 16 entries, all related to file creation by SDXHelper.exe, and they're all in the same directory, it might be worth investigating further. Even though the process is legitimate, the volume of files created could indicate a larger issue, such as a malicious process masquerading as SDXHelper.exe. However, without more context, like the process's parent or other related events, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe justification here would be that multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory might be normal, but the repetition and the number of files could be suspicious. However, since the process is known and the files are in a typical location, it might not be a threat. But the fact that there are so many entries might warrant further investigation. Therefore, the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence of around 0.6, as there's some suspicious activity but it's not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which may indicate legitimate Office activity but warrants further investigation due to the volume and potential for malicious use.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not. So first, I'll look at all the events.\n\nMost of the entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The filenames are JavaScript files with hashes in them. There's a lot of repetition here, like multiple entries for the same file path. Then there's some activity from chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll and a registry event. Also, EXCEL.EXE was started with a specific Excel file and loaded combase.dll. There's also a file created by winlogbeat.exe in the Downloads folder.\n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? So creating these JavaScript files might be part of normal Office operations, like updates or add-ins. But why so many files being created? Maybe it's a legitimate process, but the repetition might be a red flag. However, the paths are within the Office directory, which is normal for Office solutions. The hashes in the filenames could be version identifiers, which is common. \n\nThe chrome.exe events seem normal—loading urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer's components, which Chrome might use. The registry event from chrome.exe might be related to settings, but without more info, it's hard to tell. The EXCEL.EXE process opening an Excel file is definitely normal. The winlogbeat.exe event is about a configuration file being created, which could be part of installing or configuring Winlogbeat, a log shipper. That's probably legitimate unless there's something suspicious in the file path or the action.\n\nBut wait, all the SDXHelper.exe events are creating files in the SolutionPackages directory. If this is part of a legitimate Office update or package installation, it's normal. However, if the files are being created in a way that's not typical, like a large number of files or unusual names, that might be suspicious. But the filenames here are JavaScript files with hashes, which might be part of resource files for Office add-ins or solutions.\n\nI don't see any obvious signs of malware here. The processes involved are all legitimate (SDXHelper.exe, chrome.exe, EXCEL.EXE, winlogbeat.exe). The actions are file creation and image loading, which are normal. The only thing that stands out is the multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe, but if that's part of a normal process, it's not suspicious. However, if the user is expecting something more, maybe the repetition could be a sign of something else. But without more context, like other events or indicators of compromise, it's hard to say. \n\nSince all the events seem to be part of normal operations, maybe the classification is NOT INTERESTING. But I should check if there's any pattern that might indicate malicious activity. For example, if SDXHelper.exe was creating executable files or files in unusual locations, that would be a red flag. But here, the files are JavaScript in the Office directory. Also, the winlogbeat event is about a .yml.new file, which is a temporary file during configuration, which is normal. \n\nSo overall, I think these events are part of normal system and application operations. Therefore, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING. The confidence is moderate because while there's no obvious malicious activity, the repetition of file creations could be a point of concern, but without more data, it's hard to confirm.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (SDXHelper.exe, chrome.exe, EXCEL.EXE, winlogbeat.exe) performing normal operations such as file creation, registry updates, and process execution.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each log entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path looks a bit unusual. Office typically doesn't generate JavaScript files in those locations, especially with such long, seemingly random filenames. Maybe that's a red flag.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for EXCEL.EXE loading system DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so loading them is normal. However, the repetition might be normal too, depending on what Excel is doing.\n\nNext, there's a Registry value set event from svchost.exe multiple times. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and registry changes can be normal, but multiple events might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen, EXCEL.EXE creates a temporary file (~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx) in the Downloads folder. That's a common temporary file created by Excel when editing a document, so that's probably normal. But then it deletes the same file. That could be part of normal operations, like saving changes or closing the file.\n\nAnother event is a Pipe Created by EXCEL.EXE. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, which Excel might use for various purposes. Not necessarily suspicious.\n\nThe SDXHelper.exe is creating another JavaScript file in a similar path as the first one. The filename has a different hash but the same structure. This repetition might be concerning. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, but creating multiple JS files in those directories could be unusual.\n\nLooking at the HxTsr.exe process setting a registry value. HxTsr.exe is associated with the HP Software Update Manager, so that's probably a legitimate process. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, considering all these events: the main points are the creation of JavaScript files by SDXHelper.exe in non-standard locations. While Excel loading system DLLs and creating temporary files are normal, the repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe might indicate something malicious. However, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate Office component, so maybe it's just part of a normal Office update or installation. But the filenames and paths are a bit odd. Also, the presence of multiple registry changes by svchost and HxTsr.exe could be benign, but might need more context.\n\nHowever, since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity, it's possible that these are just normal operations. The JS files might be part of Office's resource files, but the paths are not typical. This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nConsidering the confidence, I'd say there's a moderate chance this is interesting, but not definitive. The classification might be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6. But I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity. The only other thing is the Pipe Created event, but that's not necessarily bad. The user account management event is also neutral.\n\nOverall, the main red flags are the JavaScript files in unusual paths. So, I think the classification is INTERESTING with a confidence of 0.65, but it's not certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple JavaScript files are created in non-standard Office directories by SDXHelper.exe, which may indicate unexpected behavior.

It's possible that SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but creating so many files in such a specific location might be suspicious. \n\nNext, there are several registry value set events from Explorer.EXE and EXCEL.EXE. Registry changes can be normal, but when combined with the file creation events, it might indicate some kind of configuration change or potential malicious activity. However, Excel and Explorer are common applications, so their registry changes might be part of normal operations.\n\nThe repetition of the same files being created multiple times by SDXHelper.exe could be a red flag. Maybe it's a benign process, but the pattern is unusual. The presence of .js files in Office's OfflineFiles directory is something that might not be typical.

Then, there are two entries about SDXHelper.exe creating a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory.\n\nHmm, so Excel normally might interact with the registry for its own operations, but having 27 identical events seems a bit suspicious. Maybe it's a normal operation, but repeated that many times? Or could it be part of some automated process or maybe a script that's making multiple changes? But then, the other part is the file creation by SDXHelper.exe. SDXHelper.exe is associated with Office, I think. It's used for some deployment tasks, maybe. But creating JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory... That might be part of a legitimate process, like updating office add-ins or something.

However, I should check if these are part of a known legitimate process. For example, Office updates or add-ins might involve registry changes and file creation. But without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or the content of the JavaScript files, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother angle: the fact that all the registry events are from Excel.exe. If Excel is being used to modify registry values, that's unusual. Typically, Excel doesn't modify the registry as part of its normal operations. Maybe a macro is doing that? But macros are usually run from within Excel, and if they're malicious, they could modify the registry. However, the logs don't mention macros here. Also, the SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office directory might be part of a legitimate deployment, but again, the filenames with hashes are a bit suspicious.\n\nSo, putting this together: multiple registry changes by Excel, which is not typical, and file creation by SDXHelper.exe with filenames that have hashes.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created various JavaScript files in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is a known process related to Microsoft Office, specifically involved in handling add-ins or solutions. The files being created are all .js files, which are common for scripts, but the paths are within the Office SolutionPackages folder. \n\nLooking at the file names, they seem to be localized UI strings, like hr-hr-ui-strings-json, hu-hu, etc. These could be part of a legitimate Office add-in or package that's being deployed. However, the repetition of some files (like the hu-hu one appearing twice) might be a red flag. Also, the fact that multiple files are being created in different language-specific folders could indicate an attempt to inject malicious code under the guise of legitimate Office resources.\n\nBut wait, Office add-ins can have such files. However, the process creating them is SDXHelper.exe, which is legitimate. The key here is whether these files are part of a known package or if there's any indication of tampering. Since all the events are about file creation and no other suspicious activities like network connections or unauthorized access are mentioned, it might be part of a normal deployment. \n\nHowever, the presence of multiple files with similar names and the specific path structure might be unusual. If this is part of a legitimate Office solution, the user might have installed a new add-in. But without more context, like the source of the package or any other events, it's hard to tell. \n\nConsidering that all the files are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory and have names that look like they could be part of a localized UI, it's possible that this is a legitimate process. However, the repetition of the same files might indicate an error or a potential malicious attempt to overwrite or inject code. \n\nBut since the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate Microsoft process, and the files are in the expected directory, maybe this isn't malicious. However, the classification depends on whether these activities are out of the ordinary. If the user hasn't installed any new Office add-ins, this could be suspicious. \n\nGiven the information, I think the classification is \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence because while the process is legitimate, the pattern of file creation might warrant further investigation to confirm if it's part of a known package or a potential threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files with localized UI string names (e.g., hr-hr-ui-strings, hu-hu-ui-strings) are being created in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory by SDXHelper.exe, which may indicate either legitimate add-in deployment or potential malicious activity disguised as benign resource files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to scan through all the events and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all in the same directory structure under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages, specifically in PackageResources\/OfflineFiles. The filenames look like they're language-specific UI strings, like it-it, ja-jp, ka-ge, etc. Each file has a unique hash in the name. But wait, some of these files are duplicated. For example, the ja-jp one appears twice. Maybe that's just a repetition in the log, not an actual issue.\n\nThen there are some events from EXCEL.EXE doing DNS queries and registry changes, and svchost.exe making registry modifications. But the main focus here seems to be the SDXHelper.exe creating these files. Now, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, right? It's part of the Office installation or updates. But creating so many files in the OfflineFiles directory might be normal, or maybe it's part of a malicious activity.\n\nWait, the filenames are all .js files with language codes. That makes me think they might be part of a legitimate localization package. However, the fact that there are so many of them, and they're all being created by SDXHelper.exe, which is a helper process, could be a red flag. Also, the duplication in the logs might indicate that the process is creating the same files multiple times, which might not be normal.\n\nBut I need to check if this is typical behavior. Office might install language packs, which would create such files. However, if this is happening in a short time frame or in an unusual location, that could be suspicious. The path is in the user's AppData Local, which is common for temporary files, but Office SolutionPackages are part of the Office installation, so maybe it's okay.\n\nAnother thing to note: the other events from EXCEL and svchost are about registry changes and DNS queries. These could be normal, but combined with the file creations, maybe there's a pattern. However, without more context, like the user's environment or other logs, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key here is that all the file creations are by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory, and the files are all UI strings. If this is part of a legitimate update or installation, then it's not interesting. But if this is happening in an unexpected context, like a user not expecting an Office update, or if there are other malicious activities, then it might be. However, based solely on the logs provided, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The files are all in legitimate paths, and the process is known. But the high number of files created might be a sign of something. However, since the user is asking for classification based on the batch as a whole, and the events don't show clear signs of malicious behavior, maybe it's not interesting. But I'm a bit torn because the repetition and the number of files could be suspicious.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a file creation event. The main process involved here is SDXHelper.exe, which is creating various .js files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. There's also one event from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads folder.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if these events are suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's typically involved in handling add-ins or solutions. The files being created are ui-strings-json files, which might be localization files for different languages. The paths are all within the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory, which seems legitimate for Office-related activities. However, the fact that there are multiple files being created with different language codes (like fr-fr, ga-ie, etc.) might be normal if the user is installing a multilingual package. But then again, it's possible that this is part of a malicious activity, like a dropper or something that's unpacking payloads.\n\nWait, but looking at the process names, all the events are from SDXHelper.exe except for the one from winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so the creation of a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory might be part of a normal configuration process. However, the .new extension sometimes indicates a temporary file that's being saved, which could be part of a normal process or an attempt to overwrite a configuration file. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, considering the repetition of the same files being created multiple times. For example, the ga-ie-ui-strings-json file appears twice. Maybe that's a duplicate event or a mistake in logging. But if the system is generating these events repeatedly, that could be a sign of something wrong. However, it's also possible that the logging system is just capturing multiple instances of the same file creation, perhaps during a package installation.\n\nAnother point to consider is the presence of multiple language-specific files. If the user is working with multiple languages, this might be expected. But if the user doesn't have a need for such localization files, it could be unusual. However, without knowing the user's environment, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key here is whether these events are part of normal operations or if they indicate a security threat. SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's being used to create files in unusual locations or with unusual names, that could be a red flag. However, the paths here are within the expected Office directories. The winlogbeat event might be unrelated, but the .yml.new file could be a temporary file that's later renamed, which is normal.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch of events doesn't show clear signs of malicious activity. The files are created by a legitimate process in a legitimate directory, and while the repetition is notable, it could be due to logging or normal operations. The confidence here is moderate, but since there's no obvious malicious behavior, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING.\" However, the presence of multiple file creations and the .new file might warrant further investigation, but without more context, it's hard to be certain. The justification would be that the events are consistent with normal Office operations, though the repetition and the .new file could be worth checking.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show SDXHelper.exe creating language-specific UI string files in expected Office SolutionPackages directories.

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first five entries, they all involve EXCEL.EXE and the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Repeated registry changes by Excel might be normal, but if it's happening a lot, it could be suspicious. However, Excel does interact with the registry for various operations, so maybe not a red flag on its own.\n\nThen, starting from the sixth event, there's a switch to SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files in specific directories under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The file paths include things like \"kok-in-ui-strings-json\" and \"lb-lu-ui-strings-json\", which look like language-specific UI string files. The filenames have hashes in them, which might be part of the package identifiers. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Microsoft Office might use some helper executables, but I'm not sure if SDXHelper is legitimate. The fact that it's creating multiple files in the SolutionPackages directory could be part of a normal Office update or installation, but the repetition and the specific naming might indicate something else. \n\nThe files are being created in the OfflineFiles subdirectory, which might be related to caching or offline access. However, the presence of multiple files with similar naming patterns and hashes might suggest that these are part of a larger package or update. But why so many files? Also, the process SDXHelper.exe is involved in creating these files, and if it's not a known legitimate process, that could be a concern.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the same file paths are repeated multiple times. For example, the kok-in-ui-strings-json file is created twice. That might be normal if it's part of a setup process that's writing files multiple times, but it could also be a sign of malicious activity if the process is trying to overwrite or install multiple times.\n\nHowever, without more context, like other events such as network connections, user interactions, or other processes involved, it's a bit tricky. The registry changes by Excel might be unrelated, but the SDXHelper activity is more concerning. \n\nConsidering that the files are in the Office SolutionPackages directory, it's possible that this is part of a legitimate Office add-in or update. However, the lack of other events that confirm this, combined with the unusual process name (SDXHelper.exe), makes me think that this might be worth investigating further. \n\nThe confidence isn't extremely high because there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the combination of non-standard process names and multiple file creations in specific directories could indicate something suspicious.

The files have names like \"ui-strings-json\" with different language codes. That seems normal for localization files, maybe part of an Office add-in or something similar. However, there's a lot of repetition here. The same files are being created multiple times, which is a bit odd. Why would the same file be created more than once? That might indicate a problem, like a loop or an error in the process.\n\nThen there's one event where EXCEL.EXE is setting a registry value. That's a different process, but it's not clear if that's related. The registry event might be normal, but combined with the repeated file creations, it could be a sign of something malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe key points here are the repetition of the same files being created by SDXHelper.exe. Legitimate software might create multiple files, but creating the same file multiple times in the same directory is unusual. It could be a sign of a malicious payload, like a dropper that's writing files repeatedly, or maybe a benign process that's malfunctioning. \n\nBut considering the confidence, I need to weigh the evidence. The repetition is a red flag. Also, the files are in the SolutionPackages folder, which is part of Office, so maybe a malicious add-in is being deployed. However, without more evidence like network activity, unusual process behavior, or other malicious indicators, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nOn the other hand, if this is part of a legitimate Office solution, maybe during an update or installation, the repeated file creation could be a mistake. But the same file being written multiple times isn't typical. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards \"INTERESTING\" because the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory is suspicious.

Each one has a process named SDXHelper.exe, a winlog task indicating a file was created, and the file path points to a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory.\n\nFirst, I need to check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, Microsoft Office-related processes can sometimes be involved in package installations or updates. However, the name SDXHelper.exe isn't one I'm immediately familiar with. Maybe it's part of a third-party application or a legitimate Office add-in?\n\nLooking at the file path, it's located in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages folder. That directory is typically used for storing solution packages, which could be part of Office add-ins or updates. The file name is a JavaScript file with a long hash-like string in the name. The presence of hashes might be normal for uniquely identifying files, but it's also a common tactic in malware to obfuscate names.\n\nNow, considering the events: two identical file creation events. That could be a sign of something being written multiple times, maybe a failed attempt or a loop. However, without more context, like other processes or network activity, it's hard to tell.

Since both events are the same, maybe this is a log duplication error or a single event logged twice. However, the confidence here is low because there's not enough information. The process name isn't obviously malicious, and the file path is within a typical Office directory. Without more indicators like unusual network connections, unexpected command-line arguments, or other processes involved, it's hard to classify this as definitely interesting.\n\nOn the other hand, the JavaScript file in a SolutionPackages folder might be part of a malicious add-in. But again, without more evidence, it's speculative. The confidence should be moderate, maybe around 0.5, because there are some suspicious elements (unusual process name, hash in filename) but also legitimate possibilities.
