The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: Update.exe loading clrjit.dll. That's a .NET component, and it's in the Windows directory. Maybe normal, but sometimes malware can disguise as legitimate files. However, I don't see any immediate red flags here yet.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Discord.exe. The command lines look like typical arguments for a process, maybe related to GPU or utility processes. The paths are in the user's AppData directory, which is common for applications. However, there's a lot of activity here—multiple process creates, image loads, and pipe creations. Discord is a legitimate app, but the frequency of events might be normal for its operations.\n\nWait, there's an event where Update.exe creates a file in the Start Menu Programs folder for Discord Inc, and then creates a Discord.lnk shortcut. That could be part of a legitimate update process. But then there are several ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. Accessing processes isn't necessarily bad, but if it's accessing other processes without permission, that could be an issue. However, the logs don't specify which processes are being accessed.\n\nLooking again, the first event mentions Update.exe loading clrjit.dll. If that's part of a normal update, maybe it's okay. But sometimes, malicious software might use legitimate-sounding names. However, the other events don't show any obvious signs of malware, like unexpected network activity or unusual file paths.\n\nThe main thing here is that there's a mix of normal application behavior (Discord running with multiple processes and image loads) and some file creation by Update.exe. Since Update.exe is often associated with software updates, this might just be a legitimate update process. However, the presence of multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe could be worth checking. But without more context, like if those accesses are to sensitive processes or if there's any unexpected behavior, it's hard to say.\n\nConsidering all the events together, they seem to be part of a software update and normal application operations. There's no clear indication of malicious activity. So, maybe this is not interesting for investigation. But I'm a bit cautious because sometimes legitimate processes can be abused.

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events here are about \"Process accessed\" with the process name \"Update.exe\". That's a lot of repeated entries. But then, there are a couple of \"File created\" events by \"Update.exe\" creating a Discord.lnk file on the desktop and another in the Start Menu. Also, there are several \"Image loaded\" events for Discord.exe loading various DLLs from the Discord application directory.\n\nNow, \"Update.exe\" is a common name for legitimate update processes, but it's also a name that malware might use. However, the fact that it's creating shortcuts to Discord might not be immediately suspicious. But wait, the Discord shortcuts are being created in the Start Menu and on the desktop. That could be normal if someone is installing Discord, but if \"Update.exe\" is doing this, maybe it's part of a legitimate update process for Discord.\n\nLooking at the other events, the Discord.exe process is loading several DLLs like d3dcompiler_47.dll, libGLESv2.dll, etc. These are typical for a graphics application, and Discord does use these libraries. So those image loads seem legitimate.\n\nHowever, the repeated \"Process accessed\" events by Update.exe could indicate that the process is being monitored or accessed multiple times, which might be normal if it's an active process. But if there's no other suspicious activity, like network connections, file modifications, or unusual commands, then it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, but the main thing here is that Update.exe is creating shortcuts to Discord. If this is part of a legitimate update, then it's okay. However, if Update.exe is not associated with Discord, that could be a problem. But the logs don't provide information about the origin of Update.exe. So without more context, like the parent process or the source of the executable, it's hard to say.\n\nBut the fact that there are multiple FileCreate events by Update.exe might be worth investigating. Creating shortcuts isn't necessarily bad, but if there's a pattern of creating shortcuts to different applications or if the process is known to be malicious, that would be a red flag. Since the logs don't indicate any other malicious activity, like unexpected network traffic or unauthorized access, the classification might be on the lower side.\n\nHowever, the repetition of ProcessAccess events might be normal if the system is actively monitoring the process. The presence of both ProcessAccess and FileCreate events could be part of a normal installation or update process. But without more context, I can't be certain.

So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: DiscordSetup.exe is being created from the Downloads folder. That's a normal setup process, maybe the user is installing Discord. Then there's Update.exe in the SquirrelTemp directory, which is part of the Squirrel update framework, commonly used by some applications for updates. That seems legitimate too.\n\nNext, several Image Loaded events for Update.exe. These include system DLLs like mscoreei.dll, mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET framework, so loading them is normal when running applications that depend on .NET. The paths are all standard Windows directories, which is expected.\n\nThen there's a File Created event for Update.exe in AppData\\Local\\Discord, which might be part of the installation process. Also, a File Created for Discord.exe in the app directory. That seems like part of the installation or update process.\n\nThere's a File Created event for winlogbeat.yml.new, which is related to Winlogbeat, a tool for collecting Windows logs. But that's in the Downloads folder, which might be a red flag if it's unexpected. However, the user might be setting up monitoring tools, so not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there are multiple Process Accessed events for Update.exe. A lot of them—20 instances. That's a lot. Normally, Process Access events can indicate something trying to interact with another process, which could be benign or malicious. However, having so many of them might indicate some unusual activity, like a process being manipulated or monitored extensively.\n\nWait, but looking at the events, all the Process Accessed events are for Update.exe. If an application is accessing another process multiple times, maybe it's part of a legitimate process, but 20 times seems excessive. Could be a sign of something trying to inject code or hook into processes. But without more context, like the target processes or the nature of the access, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe other events seem to be part of a standard installation and update process, using Squirrel, which is known for some apps. The presence of .NET DLLs is normal. The only thing that stands out is the high number of Process Accessed events. However, since there's no other suspicious activity like unexpected network connections, file deletions, or privilege escalations, maybe it's just a lot of legitimate process interactions.\n\nBut the classification depends on whether there's any indication of malicious behavior. The high number of ProcessAccess events could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. The confidence might be moderate. Alternatively, if the user is installing software that uses Squirrel and has many process accesses as part of its update mechanism, it's legitimate.\n\nConsidering that, maybe the batch isn't interesting. But the high number of ProcessAccess events might be worth looking into. However, the presence of those events alone might not be enough to classify it as interesting. The justification would be that there's a high number of ProcessAccess events, but without other suspicious signs, it's not conclusive. So maybe \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events represent standard application installation\/update behavior (DiscordSetup.exe, SquirrelTemp, .NET DLLs) with no clear indicators of compromise.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The options are either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the logs. There's a lot of entries related to Discord.exe and Update.exe. Let's see what's going on here. The first entry is about Update.exe being accessed. Then there's a Process Create for Discord.exe with a command line that includes --squirrel-install. Squirrel is a framework used for installing applications on Windows, so that might be part of a legitimate installation process. But I should note that.\n\nNext, there are multiple Image Load events for Discord.exe and ffmpeg.dll. That seems normal for a running application. Then there are Pipe Created events. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is common in legitimate software. However, if there are too many pipes or unusual ones, that could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the Discord.exe processes, there's a --type=crashpad-handler. Crashpad is a crash reporting tool, so that's part of normal operation. But then there's a URL in the command line: --url=https:\/\/f.a.k\/e. That looks like a placeholder or fake URL. Maybe that's a red flag. If the URL is something suspicious or not related to Discord's actual crash reporting, that could indicate a problem.\n\nThen there's an entry for Update.exe with a command line that includes --createShortcut Discord.exe. Creating a shortcut is a normal part of installation, but I should check if there's anything unusual here. The Update.exe is also loading .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll. These are part of the .NET Framework, so that's expected if Update.exe is a .NET application.\n\nWait, but there are multiple Image Load entries for Update.exe, including some system files. That's normal, but maybe the presence of multiple Image Loads could be part of a legitimate update process. However, the combination of the fake URL in the Discord process and the presence of Update.exe doing installations might be worth looking into.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious activity? The fake URL could be a sign that something is wrong. Also, the repeated Pipe Created events might be normal, but if they are being used for unexpected communication, that's a problem. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The presence of Update.exe and the installation commands might be part of a legitimate update, but the fake URL in the crashpad-handler could be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any unexpected file paths? The paths for Discord.exe and Update.exe are in the AppData folder, which is common for user applications. The loading of ffmpeg.dll is part of Discord's dependencies. The .NET assemblies are system files, so that's expected.\n\nHmm. The main suspicious point is the URL in the command line. If that's a known malicious URL or a placeholder, that's a concern. But if it's just a test or a placeholder in the log, maybe not. However, in real scenarios, such a URL would be checked against known malicious domains.\n\nConsidering all this, the logs show normal activities like process creation, image loading, and pipe creation, which are typical for a running application and update process. However, the presence of a suspicious URL in the command line might indicate a potential issue. But without more evidence, it's a bit ambiguous. The classification here might be on the borderline. However, since the user is asking for whether the batch is relevant for investigation, and there's at least one potentially suspicious element (the fake URL), I would lean towards INTERESTING but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creation and image load events for Discord.exe and Update.exe, including a suspicious command-line argument with a placeholder URL (https:\/\/f.a.k\/e), which may indicate potential malicious activity or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing some system event. My job is to analyze them all together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There's a lot of \"Process accessed\" events for Update.exe and Discord.exe. Then there's a \"File created\" event where a Discord.lnk shortcut is made on the desktop. That might be normal, but maybe not. Then, there's a \"Process terminated\" for Update.exe. \n\nWait, but looking further, there are several entries involving reg.exe, which is the Windows registry editor. One of the command lines shows reg.exe adding a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the value pointing to Discord's Update.exe and starting Discord.exe. That sounds like a common technique for malware to persist across reboots by adding itself to the startup folder. \n\nAlso, there are multiple registry additions under HKCU\\Software\\Classes for Discord, setting URL protocol associations. That might be part of creating a custom protocol handler, which could be legitimate if it's part of an application, but in this context, combined with the other events, it might be suspicious. \n\nThe fact that Update.exe is being accessed multiple times and then a registry key is added to run Discord.exe at startup could indicate that the malware is trying to establish persistence. The creation of the shortcut (Discord.lnk) might be a way to trick the user into launching the application, but combined with the registry changes, it's more concerning.\n\nHowever, I should check if all these events are from legitimate sources. For example, Discord is a legitimate application, but if these events are occurring in an unexpected manner, like modifying the registry without user consent, that's a red flag. The use of reg.exe with add commands to modify the Run key is a common persistence method used by malware. \n\nAlso, the multiple Pipe Created events for Discord.exe might be normal for communication, but when combined with the other suspicious activities, it's more likely to be malicious. The fact that the Update.exe is being accessed so many times could indicate it's a dropper or part of an installation process, but the registry persistence is a strong indicator of malicious intent.\n\nSo putting it all together: the combination of registry modifications for persistence, multiple process accesses, and the creation of a shortcut might indicate a malicious activity.

There's a lot of repetition here, especially the Process accessed events. But then there are some entries for Discord.exe and DiscordSetup.exe. \n\nOne event stands out: the File created event where a Discord.lnk shortcut is created on the desktop. That's a common tactic for malware to create shortcuts that might be used for persistence or to trick users. Also, there are multiple Process accessed events for Update.exe, which could indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated. \n\nAnother thing is the Registry value set events. Changing registry values can be a sign of malicious activity, like setting up persistence. The Process terminated events might be normal, but combined with other activities, they could be part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen there's the Discord.exe process with a long command line. The command line includes some parameters that look a bit suspicious, like --url=https:\/\/f.a.k\/e. That's probably a placeholder or a fake URL, which might be used for command and control communication. Also, the image loaded events for Discord.exe and ffmpeg.dll might be normal, but if ffmpeg.dll isn't expected, that could be a red flag.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be legitimate. For example, Update.exe might be part of a legitimate update process, and Discord.exe is a common application. But the combination of multiple suspicious activities—like creating a shortcut, registry changes, and unusual process activities—raises concerns. \n\nI need to check if there's a pattern here. The repetition of Process accessed for Update.exe might indicate that the process is being accessed repeatedly, which isn't typical. The creation of the .lnk file could be an attempt to create a backdoor or persistence mechanism. The registry changes and the unusual command line parameters for Discord.exe also contribute to the suspicion.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch does show some suspicious activities that might warrant further investigation.

That's normal for applications, especially ones like Discord which might have various flags. Then there are multiple process access events and image loaded events. The image loaded events include files like ffmpeg.dll, updater.node, and some GPU-related DLLs. \n\nWait, but all these files are part of the Discord application's directory. The paths are all under AppData\\Local\\Discord\\app-1.0.9190. So maybe these are just regular components of Discord. However, the presence of multiple image loads and process accesses might be normal for a running application. \n\nBut what's the catch here? Well, the same process is being created multiple times with different command-line parameters. For example, one is --type=gpu-process, another is --type=utility, etc. That's typical for a browser-based application like Discord, which uses multiple processes for different tasks. \n\nHowever, I should check if there are any unusual files being loaded. The files mentioned like ffmpeg.dll, d3dcompiler_47.dll, libGLESv2.dll, etc., are common for media and graphics processing. Updater.node might be part of Discord's update mechanism. \n\nBut why would this be interesting? Maybe if there were unexpected files or processes. However, all the events here are related to legitimate Discord operations. There's no mention of network connections to suspicious IPs, no unusual command-line arguments, no elevation of privileges, or any other red flags. \n\nThe classification here would depend on whether the logs indicate normal behavior or something malicious. Since all the events are related to a legitimate application and the files are standard for that application, this might be considered not interesting. However, sometimes even legitimate applications can have malicious behavior, but without additional context or anomalies, it's hard to say. \n\nBut the user said to analyze the entire batch as a whole. All events are about Discord.exe, which is a known application. Unless there's something in the command-line arguments that's suspicious, but looking at them, they seem standard for a process. The flags like --disable-features are common in Chrome-based apps to disable certain features. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the logs don't show any signs of malicious activity.

The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: Discord.exe creating a pipe. That's normal for communication between processes, maybe part of the app's regular operations. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there's reg.exe modifying the registry. The command line shows adding a registry key for Discord's DefaultIcon and the command for opening. That seems like part of the installation or configuration. But wait, reg.exe is a legitimate tool, so that's okay. However, multiple entries of reg.exe modifying registry values might be a red flag if they're changing critical settings, but here it's related to Discord's icon and command, which might be part of the app's setup.\n\nNext, several entries of Discord.exe being accessed and terminated. Multiple terminations could be normal if the app is crashing, but repeated terminations might indicate something's wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the Update.exe events. There's an image loaded from urlmon.dll, which is part of Windows for handling URLs. Then, Update.exe creating a shortcut in the Start Menu. That's typical during installation. But then there are multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. Maybe the process is being accessed frequently, which could be normal, but could also be a sign of something else.\n\nWait, there's a command line for Discord.exe with --squirrel-firstrun. Squirrel is a framework used for updating apps, so that's part of the update process. That's probably legitimate.\n\nHowever, the combination of reg.exe modifying registry keys, multiple process creations and terminations, and the use of Update.exe might be part of a legitimate update. But I need to check if there are any anomalies. For example, are the registry changes suspicious? The keys are under HKCU, which is the current user's hive. That's usually okay for application settings.\n\nAnother point: multiple Pipe Created events for Discord.exe. Pipes are used for inter-process communication. If there are many of them, maybe the app is communicating with other processes, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe presence of Update.exe creating a shortcut and being accessed multiple times could be part of a normal update. However, if Update.exe is not a known legitimate process, that could be a problem. But since the logs mention Update.exe under the context of Discord's installation, maybe it's part of the update process.\n\nI should check if there are any unexpected processes or unusual file paths.

The command lines for reg.exe seem to be adding registry entries related to Discord, which is expected during installation.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if this batch is interesting for investigation. The key here is whether there's any indication of malicious activity. The events seem to be related to installation or update processes. However, the frequent ProcessAccess events for Update.exe and the multiple terminations of Discord.exe could be signs of something. But without more data, like network activity or unexpected binaries, it's hard to confirm.\n\nOverall, the events look like they could be part of a legitimate software update or installation. The use of reg.exe and Update.exe is common in such scenarios. However, the multiple process terminations and accesses might warrant further investigation to ensure that no malicious activity is occurring under the guise of a legitimate process. But based solely on the provided logs, there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. So, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, but I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the combination of events is unusual for Discord's normal operations, it could be flagged as interesting. But without knowing the normal behavior, it's tricky.

Then there are a bunch of \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\" events, which might be normal if Discord is running and accessing its own processes, but the repetition could be a red flag.\n\nNext, there's another file created in the AppData directory under Start Menu Programs, which is a common place for shortcuts, so maybe that's legitimate. However, the large number of ProcessAccess events might indicate something unusual. Then there's a Pipe Created event, which could be part of normal communication, but again, the quantity might be suspicious.\n\nThen there's an entry for reg.exe adding a registry key under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord with the value \"URL:Discord Protocol\". That seems like it's setting up a protocol handler, which is something that could be done by a legitimate application, but if this is part of an installation or update, it might be normal.

Discord is a legitimate application, so normal network activity might be expected. However, the same process repeatedly connecting to the network could be a red flag. But wait, the user mentioned that the entire batch should be considered. Let me check the number of events.

The command line has various parameters, but nothing immediately suspicious. Then there are multiple instances of ProcessAccess and ImageLoad events. The ImageLoad for ffmpeg.dll might be normal since Discord might use that for media processing.\n\nBut wait, there are also events involving reg.exe.

However, Discord is a legitimate application, so maybe this is part of its normal installation process. But why are there multiple reg.exe commands? Let me check the command lines again.\n\nThe first reg.exe command adds the URL Protocol, which is common for applications that handle URLs. The second one sets the DefaultIcon, which points to the Discord executable. These could be part of setting up the application's association with the Discord protocol. However, the fact that reg.exe is being used multiple times might be normal during installation, but if this is happening during runtime, it could be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing to note is the number of events. There are multiple Pipe Created events. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, but excessive creation might indicate something unusual. However, Discord might use pipes for its own communication, so this might be normal.\n\nThe command line for Discord.exe includes some parameters like --no-sandbox and --no-zygote. These flags are typically used in Chrome-based applications, which Discord is. However, --no-sandbox could be a concern because it disables the sandbox, which is a security feature. But again, if this is part of the application's normal operation, it's not necessarily malicious. However, if the application is not supposed to be running without sandboxing, that could be a problem.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events are related to Discord's normal operations, but the registry modifications by reg.exe might be part of legitimate setup. However, the presence of multiple reg.exe commands and the use of --no-sandbox could be indicators of something unusual. But since Discord is a known application, these might be expected. However, without more context, like if this is during installation or normal usage, it's hard to say. But the batch doesn't show any clear signs of malicious activity beyond what a legitimate application might do. Therefore, the classification might be NOT INTERESTING. But I should check again for any anomalies.\n\nWait, the user is asking if the batch is relevant for investigation. If all events are normal, then it's not interesting. But if there's something that stands out, like unexpected registry changes or unusual process behavior, then it's interesting. Since reg.exe is a legitimate tool, but modifying the registry can be suspicious. However, in this case, it's part of setting up the Discord protocol handler, which is normal. The other events are standard process activities. Therefore, the batch is likely not interesting. But I need to be cautious. The confidence level might be around 0.4, as there's no clear malicious activity, but some elements could be normal for the application.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events correspond to legitimate Discord application behavior, including process creation, image loading (e.g., ffmpeg.dll), and registry modifications for protocol handler setup. No suspicious indicators like unexpected network activity, privilege escalation, or anomalous file operations are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for any signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: reg.exe is modifying the registry, specifically adding a key under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord\\shell\\open\\command. The command line points to Discord.exe with some parameters. That seems like a normal registry modification, maybe part of installing or configuring Discord. But I should check if the command line looks suspicious. The path is in the user's AppData, which is common for applications. The --url parameter might be part of how Discord handles URLs, so maybe not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Discord.exe being accessed, creating network connections, DNS queries, and image loads. A lot of network activity could be normal for a messaging app, but the frequency might be a red flag. However, Discord does need to connect to servers, so that's expected.\n\nWait, there's a line where reg.exe is adding a registry entry that points to Discord.exe with --url and %%1. That might be a way to associate .Discord files with the app, but is that normal? Maybe, but sometimes malware uses registry keys to execute payloads. However, in this case, the executable is the legitimate Discord app, so that's probably okay.\n\nAnother thing is the command line of Discord.exe in one of the entries. It has a lot of parameters, some of which are typical for Chrome-based apps (like --type=utility, --user-data-dir). But the presence of --secure-schemes and other flags might be normal for the application's functionality. However, the path to the executable is in the AppData folder, which is standard.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events: the main Discord.exe is loaded, as well as ffmpeg.dll. Ffmpeg is a common library for multimedia, so that's probably part of Discord's features. The other image load is Google.Widevine.CDM.dll, which is related to DRM, so again, that might be normal.\n\nThere's also a File Executable Detected event for Widevine.CDM.dll in the Temp folder. That might be part of a legitimate update or installation process. However, if that file wasn't supposed to be there, it could be suspicious. But since it's in the Temp directory and associated with a known component (Widevine), it's possibly legitimate.\n\nNow, considering all the network connections and DNS queries. Discord is a client-server application, so it's expected to have multiple network connections. However, the high number of NetworkConnect events might be a bit much, but without seeing the destinations, it's hard to tell. If the IPs or domains were malicious, that would be a sign, but the logs don't include that info.\n\nThe Pipe Created event could be normal inter-process communication. Registry value set events are part of the application's setup. The ProcessAccess events might indicate that the application is being monitored or accessed by other processes, which isn't necessarily bad.\n\nPutting it all together: the logs show normal application behavior for Discord, including registry modifications, network activity, and loading of legitimate DLLs. There's no obvious sign of malware or unauthorized activity. The only thing that stands out is the registry modification, but that's part of the app's configuration. Since all the files and processes are associated with a legitimate application, I think this is not interesting for investigation. Unless there's a specific indicator I'm missing, like unexpected command-line arguments or unusual network destinations, but based on the given data, it seems normal.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal Discord application behavior, including legitimate registry modifications, process creation, network connectivity, and DLL loading. No suspicious indicators (e.g., unexpected command-line arguments, malicious network destinations, or anomalous file paths) are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
