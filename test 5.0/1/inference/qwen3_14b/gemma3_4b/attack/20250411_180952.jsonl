{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events.\n\nMost of the processes here are legitimate, like svchost.exe, chrome.exe, and MpDefenderCoreService.exe. They're doing normal things like DNS queries and network connections. But then there are some suspicious entries. \n\nLooking at the cmd.exe processes, there's a command line that adds a user to the domain with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and adds them to the Domain Admins group. That's a red flag. Creating domain admin accounts is a common attack technique. Also, there's another cmd.exe command adding another user and group. Those passwords look temporary but could be part of an attack.\n\nThen there's the net1.exe and net.exe processes, which are used for network commands. The commands here are adding users and groups to the domain. That's unusual unless it's part of a legitimate admin task, but without context, it's suspicious. \n\nAlso, there's a file created by powershell.exe named \"pacote_base.txt\" and another by winlogbeat.exe. Not sure about the significance of those files, but combined with the user and group additions, it might indicate someone is trying to set up access or exfiltrate data.\n\nThe repeated use of cmd.exe and net commands to modify domain users and groups suggests a potential compromise. Even though some processes are normal, the combination of these events points to possible malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence like malware hashes or obvious payloads, but the user and group modifications are strong indicators. So I'd classify this as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: domain user\/group modifications via cmd\/net commands (e.g., adding 'pacote_principal_Admin' to Domain Admins with weak password), repeated process access\/registry modifications, and file creation in sensitive directories. These patterns indicate potential lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these four events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each one.\n\nFirst event: svchost.exe created a file at C:\\Windows\\System32\\sru\\SRUtmp.log. Wait, SRUtmp.log is part of the System Resource Usage (SRU) system, which is used for tracking resource usage. I remember that this file is typically created by the system for logging, and svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process. So this might be normal activity.\n\nSecond event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a Beats component used for collecting and shipping logs. The file path is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a configuration file being created. Since the user (fiddelis) is in the Downloads folder, this could be part of a normal setup process. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe set a registry value. PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, but setting a registry value could be part of legitimate configurations or malicious activities. However, without more context, like which registry key was modified, it's hard to tell. Need to check if there's any other event that connects.\n\nFourth event: powershell.exe had a process accessed. Again, this is a common event. If the process access is to a legitimate system process, it's normal. But if it's accessing something unusual, that's a red flag. However, the event doesn't specify the target process or any anomalies.\n\nNow, looking at all events together. The first two are file creations by legitimate processes in expected locations. The last two involve PowerShell, which is a common tool for both admin tasks and attacks. However, there's no direct link between the events. The PowerShell events don't show any obvious malicious activity like downloading files, executing scripts, or accessing suspicious processes. The registry event is just a value set, which could be part of a normal configuration change.\n\nBut wait, the presence of multiple PowerShell events might be worth looking into. However, without more context or other indicators (like unexpected network activity, unusual command-line arguments, or access to sensitive files), these events alone might not be enough to flag as interesting. The classification depends on whether there's a pattern or combination that suggests malicious intent. Since the events are isolated and don't show clear signs of compromise, maybe it's not interesting. But I'm a bit uncertain because PowerShell is often used in attacks. However, the justification needs to be concise. The confidence should be moderate, maybe around 0.5, but perhaps higher since there's no clear malicious activity. Hmm, maybe 0.4? Or maybe not enough to be classified as interesting. The answer might be NOT INTERESTING because there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior, even though PowerShell is involved. The other events are normal. So the classification is NOT INTERESTING with low confidence, but maybe the confidence is low because there's no clear link.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe) creating expected files, and PowerShell activities without clear malicious indicators. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
