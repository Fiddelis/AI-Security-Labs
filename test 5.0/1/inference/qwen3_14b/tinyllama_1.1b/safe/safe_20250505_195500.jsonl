The process involved is mostly SDXHelper.exe, which is creating JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. Now, SDXHelper.exe might be a legitimate process, maybe part of some Office add-in or update. But why so many files being created with similar names?\n\nFirst, I notice that all the files are named officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by a hash. That seems like a pattern. But why so many different hashes? Maybe they're different versions or parts of a larger package. However, the repetition of the same file name with different hashes could also be a sign of something malicious, like trying to obfuscate the files or distribute multiple payloads.\n\nThen there's the registry event from chrome.exe. Not sure how that connects yet. Maybe unrelated, but could be part of a broader activity. But the main focus here is the multiple file creations. If this is part of a legitimate update, you'd expect a few files, not over a dozen. Also, the path is in the AppData Local Microsoft Office folder, which is a common place for Office-related files, but could also be a target for malware.\n\nAnother thing is that SDXHelper.exe is creating these files. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. If it's not, that's a red flag. But even if it is, creating so many files in a short period might be unusual.

If this is a normal process, the system might have logs indicating that. If not, then it's a potential indicator of compromise.\n\nConsidering all that, the high number of files created by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory, with names that seem to be generated with hashes, might be worth investigating.

The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash. There are multiple entries for the same files, which might indicate that they're being created multiple times, maybe as part of an update or installation process.\n\nThen there's an event where chrome.exe sets a registry value, and another where it loads urlmon.dll and MpClient.dll. The registry event might be normal, but the image loads could be part of Chrome's normal operations. However, I should check if these are typical for Chrome.\n\nNow, the key point here is SDXHelper.exe. I know that SDXHelper is part of Microsoft's Office suite, used for managing add-ins and solutions. So creating files in the SolutionPackages directory seems legitimate. The repeated creation of the same files might be due to caching or updates. However, the presence of multiple identical files could also be a red flag if they're being generated in an unusual way.\n\nBut wait, the file paths are all within the AppData Local Microsoft Office directory, which is a standard location for Office to store temporary or package files. The hashes in the filenames might be checksums or version identifiers. Since there's no indication of malicious activity like execution of these files, or unusual processes, it's possible that this is just normal Office operation.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's any other suspicious activity. The chrome.exe events don't seem out of the ordinary. The registry set and image loads are typical for Chrome. So unless there's a known issue with SDXHelper.exe creating files in that directory, this might not be malicious.\n\nBut why are there so many files being created? Maybe the user is installing a new Office add-in or solution, which would explain the multiple file creations. Alternatively, if this is part of a larger attack, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that all the files are from SDXHelper.exe and in a legitimate directory makes me lean towards this being a false positive or normal activity.\n\nConfidence-wise, I'm about 60% sure. There's not enough evidence to confirm malicious intent, but the repetitive file creation might warrant further investigation. But since the files are in a legitimate path and the process is known, it's probably not interesting.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each representing a file creation event. The main thing here is to figure out if this batch of events is worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I notice that almost all the events are from the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating JavaScript files in a specific directory under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The file names have a pattern: \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash. That seems a bit odd. Why so many files with similar names? Also, the hashes are different each time, which might indicate different versions or possibly malicious payloads.\n\nWait, but SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, right? I remember that it's related to Microsoft Office, maybe part of some update or package management. However, creating so many JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory might not be normal. Typically, Office might have some resources, but generating multiple JS files with unique hashes could be a sign of something else. Maybe a malicious actor is using this process to drop files.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're all in the user's AppData folder, which is a common place for legitimate software to store data. But the fact that so many files are being created here, especially with minified JavaScript, could be a red flag. Minified files are common in web apps, but if they're being generated in a local system directory, that's unusual.\n\nAnother thing is that there's one event from \"chrome.exe\" creating a temporary file. That seems normal, as Chrome often downloads temporary files. But the rest are all from SDXHelper.exe. The repetition of the same process creating multiple files in the same directory might indicate a larger pattern. Maybe the system is being compromised, and the attacker is using SDXHelper.exe to inject malicious scripts.\n\nBut wait, could this be a false positive? Maybe there's a legitimate reason for these files. For example, if Office is installing an add-in or updating, it might generate these files. However, the number of files (over 15 entries) seems excessive. Also, the hashes in the file names are unique, which might be a way to avoid detection, or just part of a legitimate process.\n\nI need to check if SDXHelper.exe is known to create such files. If I recall, SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office Deployment Tool, used for installing Office. However, during installation, it might create temporary files, but not necessarily multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory. The presence of \"aicopilot\" in the file names might be a clue. Copilot is a feature in Office, but maybe this is related to a new feature that's being rolled out, which could explain the JS files. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key point here is the volume and the nature of the files. Multiple file creations by the same process in a non-standard location could be suspicious. Also, the fact that the files are JavaScript might indicate that they are being used for some client-side processing, which could be benign or malicious. But since they're in a local directory and not served over the web, it's a bit unclear.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, I'd say there's a moderate chance this is interesting. The justification would be the repeated creation of multiple JavaScript files by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory, which might be indicative of an unusual activity. However, without more context or other suspicious events, it's not conclusive. So, I'd classify this as \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.65, as there's enough to warrant further investigation but not enough to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple JavaScript files with unique hash-based names are created by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard Office directory, suggesting potential malicious activity or unusual behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through the events to spot any anomalies.\n\nMost of the events are about file creation and registry changes. The processes involved are SDXHelper.exe, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and EXCEL.EXE. The first thing I notice is that SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That seems a bit odd because those are typically system or application-specific directories. Creating multiple files there might indicate some kind of deployment or maybe a malicious activity.\n\nThen there's chrome.exe loading dlls like MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's normal. But there are also registry value sets, which could be part of normal operations or could be signs of configuration changes. However, the fact that chrome.exe is involved in multiple registry events might be worth looking into, but not necessarily a red flag on its own.\n\nAnother point is the Excel process opening a spreadsheet and creating a temporary file (~$Cronograma...), which is normal for Excel when it's editing a file. The temporary file is then deleted, which is expected behavior. However, the presence of multiple SDXHelper.exe activities creating files in the Office directory is more suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is not a standard Microsoft process; it might be related to some third-party software or possibly a malicious component. The repeated creation of JavaScript files in that directory could be an indicator of something trying to inject code or modify Office resources.\n\nAlso, the winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file, which might be part of a configuration change, but that's a separate process and not necessarily malicious. However, combined with the SDXHelper activities, it might suggest that there's some unauthorized configuration or file manipulation happening.\n\nPutting it all together, the main concern is the SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JavaScript files in a protected directory. This could be a sign of a malicious actor trying to compromise the system by injecting malicious scripts into Office resources. While some activities are normal (like Excel creating temporary files), the combination of SDXHelper's actions and the locations of the files created make this batch worth investigating further.

Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is EXCEL.EXE and the task is \"Image loaded\" with paths pointing to system files like urlmon.dll, combase.dll, and coml2.dll. These are all legitimate Windows system files, so that's normal. Excel using these DLLs is expected, so maybe not suspicious here.\n\nThen there's svchost.exe and Explorer.EXE changing registry values. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're from legitimate processes, it's okay. However, multiple registry events from Excel might be a red flag. But I need to check if they're part of normal operations.\n\nNext, there's a lot of activity from SDXHelper.exe creating files in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with long strings and .js extensions. The paths look like they might be part of Office solutions or add-ins. However, the repetition of similar file names and the fact that SDXHelper.exe is creating many of them might be worth looking into. SDXHelper is a known Microsoft process related to Office, so it's possible these are legitimate. But the sheer number of files created could indicate something unusual, like a malicious payload being unpacked or generated.\n\nAnother point is the file created by EXCEL.EXE named \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx.LNK\" in the Recent folder. A shortcut file in Recent is normal, but maybe if there's an unusual number of such shortcuts or if they point to unexpected locations, that could be an issue. However, the log doesn't show the target of the shortcut, so I can't tell from this alone.\n\nLooking at the confidence factors: multiple file creations by SDXHelper in specific directories might be part of a legitimate Office installation or update. However, if these files are not part of standard Office operations, it could be a sign of malicious activity. The presence of multiple similar entries for different language-specific JS files (like af-za, ar-sa, etc.) could be part of localization files, which might be normal, but it's also possible that they're being used to inject malicious code.\n\nThe registry events from Excel and Explorer are common, but if they're modifying key values that aren't standard, that's a problem. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The lack of any obvious malicious file paths (like common malware locations) might suggest that even if there's unusual activity, it's not clearly malicious.\n\nOverall, while there are some unusual patterns (like many files created by SDXHelper), the processes involved are legitimate Microsoft ones. Without more context or additional suspicious activities (like network connections to bad IPs, unexpected process execution, etc.), it's hard to classify this as definitely interesting.

The files are being created in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory, which is a known location for Office add-ins or packages. \n\nWait, but why so many files? Let me check the file names. They all have \"ui-strings-json\" in them, which sounds like localization files for different languages. The paths include different language codes like es-mx, eu-es, fr-ca, etc. That makes sense if it's part of an Office package that's being installed or updated, as it would need language-specific resources.\n\nHowever, there's also an entry involving winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a tool for collecting and shipping logs, so that might be part of a legitimate monitoring setup. But why is that here? Maybe the user is installing or configuring Winlogbeat, which is normal.\n\nNow, considering the classification. The key point here is whether these file creations are part of normal operations or something suspicious. Since the files are in expected locations and the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Office, this might be part of a legitimate installation or update. However, the repetition of multiple files with similar names could be a red flag. But considering the context, it's possible that this is just a package being deployed with multiple language files. \n\nAlternatively, if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, that could be a problem. But I believe SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, used for managing solution packages. So, unless there's other evidence, like unexpected behavior or other malicious activities, these logs might just be part of a normal Office package deployment. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. Since all the files are in the correct directory and the process is legitimate, but the number of files is high, maybe there's a 70% confidence. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But given that there's no obvious malicious activity, like unexpected processes or unusual file types, I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence. However, I should check if there's any anomaly in the file paths or names. The file names seem to follow a pattern, which is typical for resource files. \n\nAnother angle: the presence of both SDXHelper.exe and winlogbeat.exe. If winlogbeat is part of a legitimate log monitoring setup, that's normal. But if it's not, that could be an issue. However, the logs don't indicate any malicious activity from winlogbeat. \n\nOverall, without additional suspicious indicators, these events are likely part of normal operations.

So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the first 10 entries, they all seem to be about Excel.EXE performing registry value set operations. That's a lot of the same process doing the same task. But wait, Excel normally doesn't modify the registry that much. Maybe that's normal for some operations, but repeated multiple times? Hmm, maybe not. But I need to check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nThen there are a couple of entries where the process is null and the task is \"None\". Not sure what that means. Maybe those are just placeholders or errors in the log? Not sure yet. But the main thing is the SDXHelper.exe entries. There are several instances where SDXHelper.exe is creating files in specific directories under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. The filenames look like they might be JavaScript files, possibly part of some add-ins or solutions. \n\nWait, SolutionPackages sounds familiar. Microsoft Office solutions, like add-ins, might use those directories. But creating multiple JS files in there... Could be normal if it's part of an add-in deployment. However, the filenames have random-looking hashes in the paths. Like f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2 and 36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b. Those look like GUIDs or unique identifiers. Maybe that's just how Office packages are structured. But why so many files being created? \n\nAlso, there's a DNS query from Excel.EXE. Not sure if that's normal. Excel might query DNS for some features, but combined with the registry changes and file creations, it might be part of a larger activity. \n\nNow, considering the combination: Excel.EXE modifying the registry multiple times, SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JS files in SolutionPackages, and a DNS query. Could this be a sign of malicious activity? Maybe. But I need to think about what's normal. \n\nOffice add-ins can sometimes modify the registry and create files in those directories. However, the repetition of registry changes by Excel might be unusual. Also, the presence of multiple files with different language codes in the filenames (like ca-es, cs-cz, cy-gb, etc.) might indicate that the add-in is being localized, which is normal. But the number of files and the specific paths might be worth checking. \n\nHowever, without more context, like the user's environment, whether they have add-ins installed, or if there's any known malicious activity associated with these files, it's hard to say. But the fact that there are multiple registry changes by Excel and multiple file creations by SDXHelper could be indicative of something. \n\nWait, SDXHelper.exe â€“ is that a legitimate process? I think that's part of Microsoft's Office solution deployment, maybe related to add-ins or updates. But if that process is creating a lot of files, maybe it's part of a legitimate update. However, the confidence here is a bit low because the logs don't show any obvious malicious indicators like network connections to bad IPs, execution of suspicious files, or user account changes. \n\nBut the combination of repeated registry modifications by Excel and multiple file creations by SDXHelper might still be worth investigating. Maybe the registry changes are part of a configuration that's allowing the add-in to run, and the files are part of the add-in's deployment. However, the justification for being \"interesting\" would be that there's a high volume of activity from Excel and SDXHelper, which might be out of the ordinary. \n\nAlternatively, if this is a normal operation, like a user installing an add-in, then it's not interesting. But without knowing the context, it's hard.

However, the presence of multiple entries for the same file could indicate something unusual. Also, the user is using a username \"fiddelis\" which might be a placeholder or a real user, but that's not necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\nThe registry events from EXCEL.EXE are numerous. Registry modifications can be normal, but if they're all from the same process and same rule, maybe that's part of a legitimate process. However, if there's a lot of registry changes, that might be a sign of something malicious. But in this case, the logs don't show the specific registry keys being modified, so it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, considering the classification. The main concern here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe. If this is a legitimate process, then it's not interesting. But if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, or if the files being created are not part of normal operations, then it could be suspicious. \n\nOffice applications sometimes use helper processes, but SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. Maybe it's part of a third-party add-in. However, the fact that multiple files are being created in the OfflineFiles directory under SolutionPackages might be part of an installation.

The hash in the filename might correspond to a specific version of the Office package. If this file is part of a legitimate Office update or installation, then it's normal. But if it's unexpected or if there are other anomalous events around the same time, that could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the event alone, there's no immediate indication of malicious activity. The process is legitimate, the file path is standard, and the file type is common in such scenarios. Unless there are other events indicating unauthorized access, unusual process behavior, or other suspicious activities, this single event doesn't point to a security issue.\n\nTherefore, the classification here is likely \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the event aligns with normal Office installation or update processes. The confidence is high because the components involved are standard and there's no overtly suspicious activity in the provided data.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The event involves a legitimate Microsoft Office process (SDXHelper.exe) creating a JavaScript file in the standard Office SolutionPackages directory. The file path and naming convention align with typical Office installation\/update activities, and there are no indicators of malicious behavior in the provided data.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. The majority of them are from EXCEL.EXE with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and no file information. Then there are several entries from SDXHelper.exe with \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" and specific file paths. \n\nHmm, the EXCEL.EXE events are all the same: registry changes. But registry modifications can be normal, like when software is installed or configured. However, if there are a lot of them, maybe that's suspicious. But in this case, all the events are from Excel, which might be part of normal operations, especially if it's related to add-ins or macros. But I should check if there's any pattern here. Wait, all the registry events are from Excel, and they're all \"Registry value set\". But without more context, like which keys are being modified, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that there are so many of them might be a red flag.\n\nThen there are the SDXHelper.exe events. SDXHelper is part of Microsoft Office, I think. The files created are in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which seems legitimate. The file names are things like \"lb-lu-ui-strings-json...\" which look like language-specific UI strings. So maybe these are part of a normal Office update or installation. But why are there so many files being created? Maybe it's a legitimate process, but the large number of files could be unusual. However, considering that these are part of Office packages, it might be normal during an update or when deploying add-ins.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch has a lot of registry changes from Excel and multiple file creations by SDXHelper. But since both processes are associated with Microsoft Office, these could be part of normal operations. However, the high volume of events might indicate something. But without more context, like unusual registry keys or unexpected file paths, it's hard to say. The file paths here do look legitimate. \n\nWait, but the user is asking if the batch is interesting for investigation. The key here is whether there's a pattern that's suspicious. If all these events are part of normal Office activities, then it's not interesting. But if there's an unusual number of registry changes or files created in unexpected locations, that's a problem. However, in this case, the files are in standard Office directories, and the processes are known. So maybe it's not interesting. But the confidence here would be low because without more data, it's hard to be certain. However, given that the events are all from legitimate processes and the file paths are standard, it's more likely not interesting. But I need to check if there's any anomaly. For example, if SDXHelper is creating a lot of files in a short time, but the logs don't indicate timing. The user hasn't provided timestamps, so I can't assess that. \n\nSo, the justification would be that the events are related to normal Office operations, but the high volume of registry changes might be worth checking. However, since the processes are legitimate and the file paths are standard, it's more likely not interesting. But I should be cautious. Maybe the confidence is around 0.4 because there's some unusual activity (many registry changes) but no clear malicious indicators.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve legitimate Microsoft Office processes (EXCEL.EXE, SDXHelper.exe) performing normal operations like registry updates and file creation in standard Office directories. No anomalous behavior or suspicious file paths detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
