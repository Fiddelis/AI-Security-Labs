{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a single event in JSONL format. The event is about a file creation detected by a Windows log rule. The process involved is PowerShell, and the file path is in the Temp directory under AppData. The filename is __PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is interesting. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The file is in the Temp directory, which is a common place for temporary files, but also a place where malware might drop files. The filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be related to testing script execution policies, but the random string \"raz5sdjq.utt\" seems suspicious. The extension is .ps1, which is a PowerShell script. \n\nHowever, the event alone doesn't show any obvious malicious activity. It's just a file creation. Without additional context, like other events indicating execution, network activity, or unauthorized access, it's hard to tell. The classification depends on whether this is a normal system behavior or something out of the ordinary. Since the user is asking to analyze the entire batch, but there's only one event here, maybe in a larger context there's more to it. But based solely on this event, it's not conclusive. The confidence should be low because there's not enough information. The justification would be that a PowerShell script was created in a temp directory, which could be benign or malicious, but without more data, it's not certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Single event shows PowerShell creating a temporary script file in AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp, which is common for legitimate system operations and testing.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, I'll look through the events to see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances of winlogbeat.exe creating a file at the same path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipper, and creating configuration files is part of its setup. But there are two entries for the same event, which might be a duplicate or just multiple logs of the same action. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a process accessed event for powershell.exe. That's common, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then a process create event for powershell.exe. Again, normal if someone is running scripts. The Explorer.EXE event is about a registry value being set. Could be benign, like a user changing settings, but maybe not.\n\nNext, ssh.exe creating a known_hosts file. That's typical when setting up SSH connections, so probably legitimate. Then a bunch of Provider Lifecycle events for PowerShell. These are usually related to PowerShell's internal operations, like when a session starts or ends. Not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there are several Image Load events for PowerShell loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clrjit.dll, mscoreei.dll, and MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll. These are .NET runtime components and Windows Defender DLLs. Loading these is normal for PowerShell when running scripts that require the .NET framework or when Defender is involved. However, if these are being loaded from unexpected locations, that might be a red flag. But the paths here seem standard.\n\nThen there's a File Delete event for a temporary PowerShell script. Deleting a temp script after execution is common, so that's probably okay. There's also a Pipe Created event for PowerShell, which could be part of inter-process communication, but again, not inherently malicious.\n\nLooking at the svchost.exe event creating a directory under SystemProfile's AppData. svchost is a standard Windows process that hosts various system services. Creating directories there might be part of normal operations, but sometimes malware uses svchost to hide activities. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The majority seem to be normal system activities, like configuration file creation, PowerShell operations, and standard DLL loading. However, the repetition of certain events, like the FileCreate for winlogbeat and the multiple Provider Lifecycle events, might indicate something. But I don't see any obvious signs of malicious activity such as unexpected network connections, unusual process executions, or suspicious file modifications. The presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded might even suggest that the system is actively defending against threats.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if the batch is interesting for investigation. If all events are normal, then it's not interesting. However, if there's a pattern that's unusual. For example, multiple FileCreate events for the same file by winlogbeat. But that's likely just the same event being logged twice. Also, the PowerShell events are common. Maybe the fact that there's a lot of PowerShell activity, but without any clear malicious indicators, it's still not suspicious.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that these events don't show any signs of malicious behavior. They are all part of normal system operations, even though there are a few repetitive entries. Therefore, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6, as there's no clear threat, but the repetition might be a minor red flag. However, since the justification is that all events are normal, the confidence might be higher. Wait, but the user wants the confidence between 0 and 1. If there's no suspicious activity, confidence can be lower. Hmm. Maybe 0.6 is reasonable, as there's no clear evidence, but not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe 0.4 if the justification is that there's nothing suspicious. But I think the justification here is that the events are normal, so confidence could be higher. Let me check again.\n\nLooking again: winlogbeat creating config files, PowerShell doing normal things, svchost creating directories. No unexpected processes, no network activity, no unusual files. So, the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence of maybe 0.8, as there's no evidence of malicious activity. But the user might have a different threshold. However, the presence of multiple Provider Lifecycle events might be a bit odd, but not necessarily malicious. So, I think the answer is \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification that all events are normal system activities, and confidence around 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events represent normal system operations (e.g., winlogbeat configuration file creation, PowerShell execution, standard DLL loading, and svchost directory creation). No suspicious patterns, malicious artifacts, or anomalous behavior detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
