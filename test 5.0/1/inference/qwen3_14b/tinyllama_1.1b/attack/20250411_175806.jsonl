The first one is 'whoami.exe' being executed, which is a normal Windows utility that displays user information. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's a 'powershell.exe' process with a 'Process accessed' event. PowerShell is common, but access events can sometimes indicate someone trying to interact with the process, maybe for malicious purposes. But again, not definitely bad yet.\n\nThe third event is 'cmd.exe' running a command to add a registry entry under HKCU's Run key. The command adds 'estrutura_principal.exe' to start at login. That's a red flag because adding executables to the registry's Run key is a common persistence method used by malware. The path 'C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe' seems odd; maybe it's a typo or a fake path, but the action itself is suspicious.\n\nThen there's another 'powershell.exe' event with a 'Registry value set' event. This could be related to the previous registry modification. If PowerShell is being used to set registry values, especially after the cmd.exe command, it might be part of a larger attempt to modify the system.\n\nPutting this together: the combination of adding a registry entry for an executable and using PowerShell to modify the registry suggests someone is trying to establish persistence on the system. Even though some commands are normal, the sequence and the use of registry modification for persistence are strong indicators of malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because some commands could be legitimate, but the overall pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Suspicious registry modification via cmd.exe to add a persistent startup entry for 'estrutura_principal.exe' combined with PowerShell activity suggests potential malicious persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
