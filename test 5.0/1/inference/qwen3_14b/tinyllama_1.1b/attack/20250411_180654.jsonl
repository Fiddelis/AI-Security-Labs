{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's powershell.exe and chrome.exe with tasks like ProcessAccess and Registry value set. Not immediately suspicious, but maybe normal. However, looking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe executing Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts. The command lines show that these scripts are being run with a -LogPath parameter pointing to the TEMP directory, specifically key.log. That's a red flag because keystroke logging is often associated with malware trying to capture sensitive information.\n\nAlso, there are several ImageLoad events for system DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clrjit.dll. While loading system DLLs isn't unusual, the repetition and combination with the PowerShell scripts might indicate something malicious. Additionally, there's a FileDelete event where a temporary PowerShell script is deleted, which could be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nAnother point is the presence of multiple different paths for the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script across various directories. This might suggest that the attacker is using different locations to avoid detection. Also, the involvement of processes like conhost.exe and svchost.exe with file creation or registry changes could be part of a broader attack.\n\nThe fact that the same script name is used multiple times with different paths and the use of TEMP directory for logging suggests a coordinated effort to capture keystrokes, which is a clear sign of malicious intent. Even though some events might be normal, the combination of these factors points towards a potential security threat. So, the classification here should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in TEMP directory, indicating potential keystroke logging.
