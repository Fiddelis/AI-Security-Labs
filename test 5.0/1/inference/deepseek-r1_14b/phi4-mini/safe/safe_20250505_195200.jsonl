The files are all located in different paths under the same user's AppData directory. \n\nFirst, I notice that every single event is from the same executable and involves creating files. That might not be suspicious on its own since many legitimate processes create temporary or configuration files. But looking closer, the file paths seem to point to resources related to Microsoft Office, specifically things like \"SolutionPackages\" and \"OfflineFiles\". Those areas are usually used for storing cached or offline content for Office applications.\n\nThe filenames include variations like \"vendors~something.js\", which suggests they might be JavaScript files related to vendor libraries. Some of them have names like \"excel-copilot-strings\" and \"podcastui\", which could be part of legitimate Office features, especially Copilot-related scripts in Excel or other Office apps. The repeated patterns in filenames, such as the same hash appearing multiple times, make me think these are just different versions or updates being cached.\n\nSince all events involve file creation by a known Microsoft process, there's no indication of malicious activity like unauthorized access or unusual process behavior. No signs of file deletions, modifications outside expected operations, or other anomalies that might suggest an attack. \n\nHowever, the number of events—each creating multiple files in quick succession—might raise an eyebrow if this is outside normal operation for SDXHelper.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. So, I'm given a batch of JSONL events where each event has the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". Each entry logs that a file was created in Windows and provides the full path of the file.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar—maybe it's part of Microsoft Office? From what I recall, Microsoft Office uses various helper processes for different features. The paths mentioned are inside the \"Office\" folder under \"AppData\", which suggests they're related to Office settings or plugins.\n\nLooking at the files being created: all of them are .js files located in \"PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\". These seem like JavaScript resource files, possibly used by Excel add-ins or other Office features. The filenames follow a pattern with hashes and some identifiers, maybe version numbers or package names. This makes sense for cached or offline resources that Office might need.\n\nThe event is consistent across all entries: same process creating multiple files in the same directory. Since they're all under Microsoft's Office structure, it looks like normal operation rather than something malicious.\n\nI should consider if this activity could be suspicious. Malware often creates files in unexpected locations or uses different naming conventions. Here, everything aligns with standard Office operations. There are multiple entries, but that just indicates several resources being loaded, which is typical for an application with many features or plugins.\n\nThere's no indication of unauthorized access, unusual file sizes, or attempts to execute these files—just the creation events. So, from a security standpoint, this doesn't raise red flags. It's more about legitimate application behavior.\n\nIn summary, all signs point towards normal activity related to Microsoft Office setup or updates, not malicious behavior. Therefore, it's probably \"NOT INTERESTING\" for an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation activities by the SDXHelper.exe process within a standard Microsoft Office directory structure.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem. I'm given a batch of JSONL events and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The output should be in a specific JSON format with only one classification, justification, and confidence score.\n\nFirst, looking at each event: they all have \"process.name\" as SDXHelper.exe. This process is responsible for handling Office Solution Pack updates. Each event indicates that a file was created under the same path structure but with different filenames ending in .js.\n\nI notice that many of these events are duplicates. The same files are being created multiple times. Since it's all within the Microsoft Office directory, this seems like legitimate activity related to software updates or component installations.\n\nThe task field mentions \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which is a standard Windows event indicating a new file was made. This isn't unusual unless there's an irregularity in the number of files being created or access patterns that deviate from normal behavior.\n\nConsidering the path, it's located in the Office Solution Packages, which is a typical location for such updates. There's no indication here of any unauthorized access or malicious activity; all events are within expected operational parameters.\n\nSo, while each event on its own isn't concerning, having multiple identical file creation events suggests routine operations rather than anything nefarious. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple duplicate entries of files being created by SDXHelper.exe within a Microsoft Office directory, indicating normal operation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events. They all seem to be similar JSON objects. Each event is generated by a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which suggests that a file was created on the system.\n\nLooking deeper, every event has a different file path but they all end with various .js files under the same directory structure. Specifically, the paths are variations of \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by different hexadecimal strings. The locations point to an Office package resource within the user's AppData folder.\n\nSDXHelper.exe is likely part of Microsoft Office or related software since it's accessing the SolutionPackages directory. These files being created might be part of normal updates or cache activities for Office add-ins or AI features like Copilot.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here, such as unexpected file creation in system directories or executables being written. The consistent process name and predictable file operations suggest this is routine behavior from legitimate software components.\n\nTherefore, these events don't raise any red flags.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, all the events are file creation logs generated by \"SDXHelper.exe\". The files being created are JavaScript files located in various subdirectories under the user's Office Solution Packages directory. These files have names like \"excel-copilot-strings\" and \"office-iss\", which suggests they might be related to Microsoft Office features, possibly Copilot or some other add-ons.\n\nI notice that there are multiple entries for similar file paths but with different hashes in their filenames. For example, several events create files under \"PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\" with varying hash strings appended to the filename. This repetition makes me think it's part of a normal software operation rather than malicious activity. Typically, legitimate processes might generate multiple files or cache entries when initializing features.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though they aren't provided here), if these events occurred in quick succession, it could indicate that SDXHelper.exe is processing or loading multiple resources as part of its startup routine. This doesn't raise any red flags immediately since such behavior is common for applications initializing their components.\n\nAnother point to consider is the user context. All files are under the \"fiddelis\" user's AppData directory, which aligns with typical user-specific application data storage. Malicious actors often try to remain undetected by blending in with normal user activity, but here the pattern doesn't seem unusual.\n\nThe only outlier is the event where \"winlogbeat.exe\" creates a file named \".winlogbeat.yml.new\". This might be part of log management software setting up its configuration. Since it's a known process related to log shipping or monitoring tools, it's likely benign unless there are signs of tampering, which aren't evident here.\n\nI don't see any indicators of compromise such as execution from unexpected locations, writes to system directories, or unusual file hashes that correlate with known malware. The repetitive creation of similar files by a single process suggests routine operations rather than exploratory behavior typical of an attacker.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to keep an eye on what processes are doing, especially in enterprise environments, the events here don't exhibit signs of malicious activity. They appear to be part of normal software operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe for legitimate Office-related resources.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's see what we have here.\n\nLooking at each JSON object, they all have the same structure. The process name is always \"SDXHelper.exe\". The winlog task indicates a file was created, specifically by the rule \"FileCreate\". The files are all under a path that includes \"Microsoft Office\", which suggests it's related to an Office package.\n\nEach event has a different file path ending with various .js filenames. This pattern repeats multiple times—there are 15 events in total, each creating a new JavaScript file in the same directory.\n\nI'm thinking about what this means. SDXHelper.exe is often associated with Microsoft Office and handles tasks like updating or managing package resources. The fact that it's creating multiple files sequentially could be normal if it's part of an update process or cache activity. However, the number of files created might be a red flag. Typically, such packages don't create this many files in a short period unless something is wrong.\n\nBut wait, sometimes legitimate processes do create several files quickly when initializing resources. So I shouldn't jump to conclusions too fast. The path structure seems consistent, which suggests it's part of the expected behavior for Office Solution Packages.\n\nHowever, creating multiple files without any variation or pattern might indicate an attempt to write numerous files, possibly as part of a persistence mechanism or to flood the system with unnecessary data. Alternatively, if these were malicious scripts, they could be indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n\nBut in this case, all the filenames are predictable and follow a naming convention typical of JavaScript resource files used by Office add-ins or similar features. The repetition might just be part of how the package is being loaded or updated.\n\nI should also consider the source of these events. If they're from a user's machine running Microsoft Office normally, this could be normal behavior during an update or installation. But if this activity happens in an environment where such updates aren't expected, it might warrant closer investigation.\n\nOn the other hand, if this is part of a legitimate process, then there's no cause for concern. However, the volume and repetition make me think it's worth noting as \"interesting\" because unusual file creation patterns can sometimes be early signs of malicious activity, even if they turn out to be benign.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while these events could be part of normal Office operations, the repetitive nature and number of files created are outside typical user behavior.

The paths are to .js files under Microsoft Office's Solution Packages, which seems normal since Office uses these for add-ins or solution packages.\n\nI don't see anything immediately suspicious here. SDXHelper.exe is likely a legitimate Windows process, possibly related to system diagnostics or security tools.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events from a cybersecurity perspective. Each event is a JSON object, and there are multiple lines, each representing an individual event. The task is to determine whether the entire batch is \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze what these logs represent. Each line starts with the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\", which indicates that this is the process responsible for the logged activity. The event type is a file creation event as per the Windows log (winlog), specifically under the task \"File created\" and associated with the rule \"FileCreate\". \n\nLooking at the file paths, all events point to files located in the Office Solution Packages directory within the user's AppData folder. The specific subdirectories are \"PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\", which suggests these are related to Microsoft Office features, possibly like Copilot or AI tools integrated into Office applications. The filenames include various hash-like strings (e.g., d11781d2fe5fa91a88606c180ae1bd30.js) and \"word-copilot\" or \"officeaicopilot\", which further indicates these are JavaScript files related to Office add-ins or features.\n\nNow, considering the nature of these events: each line represents a file creation. Since these are all within legitimate Microsoft Office packages, it's normal for such processes to create files in these directories during operation, especially when dealing with updates, language packs, or AI features like Copilot. \n\nI also notice that there are multiple entries with different filenames but the same process and directory structure. This repetition is typical when an application initializes, as it might be loading several resources or scripts needed for its functionality. It's not unusual for a helper process like SDXHelper.exe to create multiple files during startup or feature activation.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious behavior here? The process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" doesn't immediately ring alarm bells; it sounds like it could be a legitimate Microsoft-related tool, possibly used by Office for deployment or updates. Additionally, the file paths are within standard Windows directories, not in places typically associated with malware (like the Temp folder or Program Files without proper versioning).\n\nThe use of JavaScript files is common in web-based applications and add-ins, which again points to these being part of a legitimate application's resources rather than malicious scripts.\n\nAnother point to consider: if there were signs of tampering, such as filenames that are unusual or contain unexpected characters, or if the process was running with elevated privileges without justification, that could raise flags. However, in this case, all files seem to follow a predictable naming convention related to their function within Office features.\n\nAlso, considering the volume of events—14 file creation events from the same process—it's possible that this is part of a normal update cycle or resource loading when multiple add-ins are being initialized. It doesn't appear excessive for such an operation.\n\nIn summary, these logs show legitimate file creation activities by a known Microsoft-related process in standard directories, with files that support Office features like Copilot. There's no evidence of unusual behavior, such as creating system files, executing code outside expected paths, or accessing sensitive areas without authorization. Therefore, the batch doesn't warrant further investigation from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file creation activities by a known Microsoft process related to Office features, with no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
