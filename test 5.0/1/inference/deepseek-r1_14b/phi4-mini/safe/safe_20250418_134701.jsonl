The file names vary, but they all end with .d.ts, which I know is a TypeScript declaration file.\n\nSo, this seems to be related to a development environment. Git is being used to create these files, probably during a build or installation process of a project using Cypress and Lodash libraries. \n\nI'm wondering if creating multiple files in the node_modules directory is normal. Since node_modules is where npm packages are stored, it's common for npm install or build commands to create or update files there. Git might be part of a CI\/CD pipeline that checks out code, runs npm install, and creates these files.\n\nThe justification I can think of is that this activity appears to be part of normal software development processes. The same process (git.exe) is creating multiple related files in the expected location for project dependencies. There's no indication of anything malicious here—no unusual file paths or unexpected processes accessing restricted areas.\n\nTherefore, since all events are consistent with typical build and installation steps, this batch doesn't seem suspicious.

Each one is a JSON object with details about a file creation event. The process name is always \"git.exe\", and the files being created are under a path that includes \"node_modules\", which suggests it's related to a Node.js project, maybe someone using Cypress for testing.\n\nFirst, I notice all these events are from the same process, git.exe, which is commonly used for version control. The file paths point to TypeScript definition files (\".d.ts\") in the Cypress types folder. These are likely part of the development environment setup, especially if someone is working on a project that uses Lodash's functional utilities.\n\nSince all these events are just standard file creation during a git operation, like cloning or pulling a repository, they don't seem suspicious on their own. There's no indication of unusual activity like access to restricted files, multiple failed login attempts, or changes to system configurations. It looks like normal development work.\n\nI'm also considering the context of similar log entries I've seen before. When developers set up their environment, installing dependencies with npm or yarn would trigger such file creations as part of package installations. Cypress and Lodash are common tools in the front-end development stack, so this activity is expected in a typical dev setup.\n\nThere's no variation in the process name or any signs of privilege escalation. Each event follows the same pattern, which makes me think it's part of a legitimate operation rather than malicious behavior. If there were things like file deletions, writes to unexpected locations, or attempts to execute files, that would raise more flags.\n\nSo, putting all this together, I don't see any red flags here.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, each event is in JSONL format, meaning one JSON object per line. Each line has three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file path information.\n\nThe process name across all events is consistently \"git.exe\". Git is a version control system widely used for software development. It's perfectly legitimate and common to see git-related processes on a system.\n\nLooking at the Windows log task field, every event reports \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This indicates that a file was created. The files in question are located under paths like \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\" with various .d.ts file names.\n\n.d.ts files typically contain TypeScript declaration files, which define interfaces and types used in TypeScript projects. The presence of these files is normal when working with frameworks like Cypress, especially if the user is developing or setting up a project that uses TypeScript.\n\nConsidering all events together, they show multiple consecutive file creation events from git.exe in a standard project directory structure. This pattern aligns with typical development activities, such as cloning repositories, installing dependencies, or building projects where many files are created or updated.\n\nI should also think about whether these actions could indicate malicious behavior. Since the process is git.exe and the files being created are part of a node_modules directory (common in npm-based projects), this doesn't raise any red flags. Malware or attack vectors usually don't operate through standard development tools like Git unless there's an explicit exploit, which isn't indicated here.\n\nAdditionally, the file paths are all under a user's Downloads folder within a course-specific directory (\"S206 - Qualidade de Software\"), suggesting academic or project-related work. There's no indication of unusual locations or activities outside normal user behavior.\n\nAnother angle is to consider if repeated file creation events could be part of a larger attack pattern, like file distribution or persistence mechanisms. However, the files here are static and related to a known software setup, not something dynamically generated or executing code.\n\nIn summary, these events collectively represent legitimate user activity involving development tools and project setups. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, malicious code execution, or data exfiltration. The consistency in process name and file operations further supports the conclusion that this is normal behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple consecutive 'File created' events from git.exe in a typical development environment, indicating legitimate activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

I'm supposed to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The user is giving me JSONL data with each line being an event. \n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see that all of them are from git.exe creating files. Each entry has \"winlog\" indicating it's a Windows log event. The task is \"File created\", which is straightforward—something creating new files.\n\nThe file paths mentioned are all within a node_modules folder under cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp. These look like TypeScript definition files (.d.ts), which are common in JavaScript\/TypeScript projects for type checking. Node modules are standard directories where third-party libraries and their dependencies are stored, so this isn't unusual.\n\nNow, considering the context—git.exe is a version control tool used for source code management. When developers clone repositories or pull updates, git often creates new files or directories as part of the process. The presence of multiple .d.ts files being created at once suggests that it's during a git operation, likely an initial clone or a fetch where these files are downloaded and saved.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual processes, no creation of executables outside standard directories, and all activities point to normal software development workflows. The user is probably working on a project using Cypress for testing, which relies on Node.js and thus the node_modules directory.\n\nSo, putting it all together: these events are part of a routine git operation related to a developer's environment. There's no indication of anything suspicious like unauthorized access or malicious file creation. Therefore, this batch isn't particularly interesting from a security investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe within a node_modules directory, which is typical during development setups.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The first thing I notice is that every event has the same structure: it's about a file being created by git.exe. \n\nLet me break down each event:\n\n- **Process Name**: All events show \"git.exe\", which is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments.\n- **Event Task**: Each one mentions \"File created\" under winlog, specifically triggered by the rule \"FileCreate\". This indicates that a new file was created on the system.\n- **File Path**: The paths are all within the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\*. The filenames vary but they're all .d.ts files, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files. These are typically used in Node.js modules to provide type information.\n\nNow, considering the context: \"node_modules\" suggests this is part of a JavaScript or TypeScript project. Cypress is a popular testing framework for web applications, and lodash is a utility library. The multiple .d.ts files being created sequentially makes sense during the setup or installation phase of such a project. \n\nI'm thinking about whether these activities are normal. In development environments, it's common to see tools like git creating files in node_modules as dependencies are installed or updated. This doesn't raise any red flags because it aligns with typical build and install processes.\n\nIs there anything unusual? All events come from the same process (git.exe) writing multiple small files to a predictable location. There's no indication of unexpected paths, access to sensitive areas, or unusual file sizes or naming conventions that might suggest malicious activity.\n\nConsidering the user's context: If this is happening on a developer's machine or within a CI\/CD pipeline, these events are entirely expected and part of standard operations. Without additional context indicating otherwise (like odd timestamps, multiple failed attempts, or writes to unexpected locations), there's no reason to flag this batch as concerning.\n\nSo, after analyzing all the events together, they seem to fit normal development behavior.

Let's see what we have here.\n\nLooking at each event, it seems like every line is a JSON object with similar structure. The 'process' field shows that git.exe is the process involved. The 'winlog' indicates that a file was created, and the specific files are listed in the 'file' path. \n\nThe file paths all point to \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\" followed by different .d.ts filenames. These look like TypeScript definition files for Lodash's functional programming utilities.\n\nSo, each event is a file creation by git.exe in the node_modules directory of a Cypress project. Node_modules is a common folder in JavaScript\/Node.js projects where dependencies are stored. The fact that multiple files are being created suggests this could be part of installing or updating dependencies, perhaps during a 'npm install' or similar command.\n\nI know that during development, especially with tools like npm, it's normal for many files to be created or modified as packages are installed. Git might be tracking these changes, hence the process name. Since all events are related to creating files in a standard project structure and involve common tools like git and npm, this doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nThere's no indication of any unusual activity, such as access to restricted areas, multiple failed login attempts, or deletions of important files.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a set of JSONL events to analyze as a cybersecurity expert. My goal is to determine if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by going through each event and looking at the patterns.\n\nFirst, I notice that all these events have similar structures. Each line starts with a process named \"git.exe\". The next part is a Windows log entry indicating that a file was created, triggered by a rule called FileCreate. Then there's a file path pointing to different .d.ts files within a node_modules directory related to cypress and lodash.\n\nSo, all these events are file creation events from the same process (git.exe). The paths are all under the same directory structure: C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\. Each path ends with different .d.ts files. Since they're all part of node_modules, it suggests this might be related to a development environment, possibly someone working on a project using Node.js and tools like Cypress for testing.\n\nLooking at the file extensions, .d.ts stands for declaration files in TypeScript. These are used to provide type information for modules that don't have their own type definitions. So, these files are likely part of a standard setup when installing dependencies via npm or yarn. Git.exe being the process indicates it's part of version control operations—maybe during an install command where node_modules are being updated or created.\n\nI should consider whether such file creation events are normal. In development environments, especially with tools like npm\/yarn, it's common for files to be created as dependencies are installed or updated. Since all these files are under node_modules and cypress\/types\/lodash, which are standard libraries, this doesn't raise any immediate red flags.\n\nCould there be something malicious here? It's possible that an attacker might use legitimate processes for malicious activities, but in this case, the process is git.exe, commonly used for version control. However, creating multiple files in a short time could indicate some activity, but given that it's part of node_modules and under Cypress types, it seems more likely to be normal development.\n\nI also need to think about the volume of these events. There are 14 entries here, each creating a different file under the same directory. While it might seem like a lot, during an install or setup phase, especially in projects with many dependencies, such a number could make sense. It's not uncommon for node_modules to have numerous files.\n\nAnother angle is whether these events were generated together in a short period. If they all occurred within seconds, that might suggest something suspicious, like a script generating files rapidly. However, without timestamps, it's hard to tell the exact timing between each event. But given the context, it's more plausible that this happened during an extended setup process.\n\nI should also consider if there are any anomalies in the file paths or names. All paths point to predictable locations under cypress and lodash, which are well-known libraries. There's no indication of unusual directory traversal or writing to unexpected areas, like system folders or user-specific sensitive files.\n\nThe justification for classification would focus on whether this activity is normal or could indicate malicious behavior. Since all events are related to the same process creating expected files in a development environment, it doesn't seem interesting from a security standpoint.\n\nAs for confidence, I'm fairly confident that these events aren't suspicious. The context points towards legitimate file creation during development setup. Unless there's additional information suggesting otherwise, such as unusual timestamps or locations, I'd classify this as NOT INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal file creation activities during the setup of a development environment using Node.js and Git.

The files all seem to be under the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\". They have various filenames, like updateWith.d.ts, upperCase.d.ts, and so on.\n\nFirst thought: Git is a version control system, often used by developers. When you clone a repository or extract files using git, it's common for many files to be created at once. The path with \"node_modules\" suggests this is related to a Node.js project, specifically a Cypress project since I see \"cypress\" in the directory.\n\nSo each event shows that git.exe is creating these .d.ts files. TypeScript files usually have .ts extensions, but these are .d.ts which are declaration files for TypeScript. These are part of the type definitions and are generated when you compile TypeScript code.\n\nSince all these events are from the same process (git.exe) and all relate to the creation of files in a typical development environment, this doesn't raise any red flags.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a Windows system. The task is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what each event contains. Each line has three main parts: process information, a winlog entry, and file details. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\" in all events. The winlog task is always \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means the system detected that a file was created. The file paths are all under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\" followed by different .d.ts files.\n\nSo, I'm noticing that these events are all related to the creation of TypeScript declaration files (since they end with .d.ts) within a node_modules folder. The process creating them is git.exe, which might be part of a development workflow, perhaps during a checkout or an npm install operation.\n\nNow, considering the context: node_modules is a standard directory in Node.js projects where dependencies are stored. Cypress is a testing tool that's commonly used with Node.js applications. Lodash is a popular JavaScript library, and having its types in this directory makes sense if the project uses TypeScript.\n\nThe repeated creation of files by git.exe might seem unusual at first glance because one typically associates git with version control, not file creation. However, when you think about it, during certain operations like cloning a repository or restoring packages, git can be involved in checking out files or managing submodules, which could involve creating new files.\n\nI should also consider whether this activity is normal for the system. If the user is working on a development project using these tools, then yes, creating these files would be expected behavior. The fact that multiple .d.ts files are being created one after another isn't necessarily suspicious in itself—it could just be part of the build process or setup.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether this activity correlates with any known malicious patterns. I'm not aware of any specific attacks where attackers use git.exe to create files in a node_modules directory, especially for TypeScript declarations. Typically, malware would look for other ways to persist or exfiltrate data rather than creating such files.\n\nLooking at the file paths again, they all follow a predictable naming convention and are within a well-known project structure. There's no indication of unusual locations or filenames that might suggest tampering or malicious activity.\n\nThe frequency of these events is also something to think about. If this happened just once, it might be more notable, but seeing multiple file creations in sequence could just be part of a routine process like installing dependencies or building the project for the first time.\n\nI should also consider whether there's any missing information that would make this batch suspicious. For instance, if these events occurred outside of normal working hours or if they were followed by other activities, that might raise an eyebrow. But as it stands, each event is standalone and doesn't show any deviation from expected behavior.\n\nIn summary, all the events are related to file creation during what appears to be a standard development process involving Node.js, TypeScript, Cypress, and Lodash. The consistent use of git.exe in this context seems normal rather than malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of TypeScript declaration files during a development process using Node.js tools, which is a normal activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The paths provided are all under \"node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/\". This seems like standard files generated when installing or updating dependencies in a Node.js project, specifically related to Cypress, which is a testing framework.\n\nI notice that all the filenames end with \".d.ts\", which suggests they're declaration files for TypeScript.

Having these specific files being created doesn't raise any red flags because it's typical during development setups or when dependencies are updated.\n\nThe repetition of the same process name and similar file operations makes me think this could be part of a script or build process installing or updating dependencies. Since all events are consistent and follow a pattern, there's no evidence of unusual behavior like multiple processes creating files in different directories or unexpected access patterns.\n\nI also consider whether these activities might be indicative of malicious behavior. Typically, malicious actors would try to hide their tracks or use less common tools, not something as mainstream as Git. The creation of multiple files in a known development directory doesn't suggest anything suspicious.\n\nMoreover, the paths are specific and structured, which is normal for development environments. There's no indication of file deletions, access to sensitive areas, or other signs that could point to an attack. All activities here seem benign, related to software development.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing all these events together, I don't see any reason to classify this batch as interesting from a security perspective. It appears to be standard file creation during normal system operations, likely part of the build process or dependency management.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development setups.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm looking at a series of JSONL events here. Each line represents an event with some key details: the process name is git.exe, the task is a FileCreate event from Windows logs, and the file paths all seem to be under node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash, ending with various .d.ts files.\n\nFirst off, I need to figure out if these events are interesting for investigation. Let's break down what each part means.\n\nThe process name git.exe suggests that Git is being used here. Now, Git is a version control system, commonly used in development environments. It's not inherently malicious, but its usage can sometimes be part of malicious activities, like during attacks where attackers may use it to exfiltrate data or move laterally within a network.\n\nThe task is FileCreate, which indicates that files are being created. This isn't unusual on its own—applications create and delete files all the time as part of normal operations. However, when combined with other factors, it could raise suspicion.\n\nLooking at the file paths: C:\\Users\\... \\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\*.d.ts. These seem to be TypeScript definition files for Lodash within a Cypress project. Node_modules is where npm packages are stored, so this looks like standard development setup.\n\nBut why would Git create multiple files in this directory? Well, during a checkout or clone, especially if the repository includes these files, it's normal. However, if these events happened after some other unusual activity, they might be worth looking into. But in isolation, creating files under node_modules is part of installing dependencies.\n\nNow, considering all 15 events are similar and involve git.exe creating files in a Cypress project's node_modules directory, there doesn't seem to be any indication of malicious intent here. It looks more like development activity—perhaps someone working on the project with Cypress testing framework and Lodash library.\n\nI should also think about the context: if this is happening in a controlled environment where development activities are expected, these events would be normal. But if they occurred in an unexpected time or followed other suspicious actions, it might warrant closer investigation.\n\nAnother angle is the frequency of these events. Creating 15 files in quick succession could be part of a script running during setup, which again isn't necessarily malicious. Without seeing timestamps and more context on surrounding activities, it's hard to say.\n\nIn terms of confidence, since all events are consistent with normal development processes and there's no evidence of unusual behavior beyond that, I'd rate the confidence low in this being suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Git creating several TypeScript files under a Cypress project's node_modules directory, which is typical during development setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.1\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format. Each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at each event, they all have similar structures. The process name is \"git.exe\", the winlog task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the file paths are various .d.ts files under a node_modules directory related to Cypress and lodash.\n\nSo, I need to analyze these events collectively. First, what does git.exe do? Git is version control software. When you run git commands, it can create or update files in your repository. The fact that multiple files are being created by git.exe suggests that something like a clone, fetch, or checkout operation might be happening.\n\nThe file paths point to TypeScript type definitions (.d.ts) for Lodash functions within the Cypress node_modules directory. That seems normal because when you install npm packages, node_modules gets populated with their types and other files.\n\nEach event is an individual file creation. So, 12 events mean 12 different .d.ts files being created by git.exe. This looks like part of the process of setting up a development environment, where dependencies are being installed or updated.\n\nI should consider if this activity is unusual. If this occurred on a system where development tools aren't expected, it might raise an eyebrow. But in a typical development environment, especially one using npm and git for version control, this is perfectly normal.\n\nIs there any sign of malicious behavior here? The process is legitimate (git), the action is standard (file creation during installation\/checkout), and the files are part of known libraries (Cypress and Lodash types). There's no indication of unauthorized access, encryption, or other signs of malware activity.\n\nAlso, looking at the timestamps would be helpful if provided, but since they're not included, I can't tell how frequent these events are. However, given that it's a batch of 12 related events, it seems like part of a single operation, which is consistent with git handling multiple files during an install or update.\n\nCould there be any other angle? Maybe if the node_modules directory is in an unexpected location, but the path provided looks like a standard user Downloads folder structure. So, unless there's context that this particular user shouldn't have access to such tools, it doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nIn conclusion, these events don't indicate anything malicious or unusual. They fit the pattern of normal development activity involving git and npm packages. Therefore, the batch is likely not interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creations by git.exe during what appears to be a typical development setup or dependency update process, which is normal in environments using npm and git.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
