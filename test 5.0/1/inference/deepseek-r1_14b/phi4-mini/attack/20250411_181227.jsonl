Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that create scheduled tasks. These tasks are set to run on startup and have the action of executing calc.exe. The fact that these are scheduled tasks created by a script suggests potential persistence mechanismsâ€”malware often uses such methods to ensure it runs at system startup.\n\nLooking closer, each event shows different task names like 'registro_geral', 'unidade_ativo', etc. This variety might indicate an attempt to create multiple tasks as part of a broader attack, possibly to avoid detection or to ensure the payload is executed under different contexts.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where PowerShell accesses registry values and processes. These actions could be related to setting up persistence points in the registry, which is another common tactic for malware to maintain presence on a system.\n\nThe use of 'BUILTIN\\Administrators' group with 'RunLevel Highest' in the scheduled tasks suggests that these tasks have high privileges. This is concerning because it means if any of these tasks are malicious, they could potentially execute calc.exe with elevated permissions, leading to more severe consequences.\n\nI also notice a few events involving Chrome and other processes, but those don't seem related to the malicious activities observed in the PowerShell commands. However, their presence doesn't negate the suspicious nature of the majority of the events.\n\nIn summary, the repeated creation of scheduled tasks via PowerShell that execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges is a red flag. This pattern strongly suggests unauthorized system changes aimed at persistence, which could be indicative of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell creating scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe at logon with elevated privileges suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is often used in legitimate scripts but can also be a vector for malicious activity. The first few entries show ImageLoad and FileCreate\/Delete tasks related to powershell.exe creating temporary files. This could be suspicious because creating and then deleting files quickly might indicate an attempt to hide evidence or persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further, there's a command-line argument in one of the events where powershell.exe is executing a script that creates a scheduled task. The command runs calc.exe at logon with admin privileges. That seems concerning because it's a common tactic for attackers to create tasks that run at user logon to maintain persistence. This could be a sign of malicious activity aiming to persist across reboots.\n\nThen, there are several events from chrome.exe modifying the registry. While chrome can make registry changes during normal operation, multiple such events might indicate something amiss, especially if they're not typical for the user's interaction with Chrome. However, without more context, it's harder to judge this part as suspicious.\n\nThe latter half of the logs show \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks but no associated process or file information. These could be legitimate remote management actions, but repeated remote command executions without clear justification might warrant closer investigation.\n\nConsidering all these points together: powershell.exe creating and deleting files, scheduling tasks with admin privileges, and numerous remote command executions suggest potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because multiple red flags are present across different events.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activities such as powershell.exe creating and deleting temporary files, executing a script that schedules tasks with elevated privileges, and numerous remote command executions. These indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see if there's anything that stands out as suspicious.\n\nThe first event shows a process named 'powershell.exe' with a command line that looks like it's creating a scheduled task. The command uses some PowerShell code to create a new scheduled task action, trigger at logon, targeting the Administrators group with high privileges. This part makes me think because using PowerShell for administrative tasks is common but could also be malicious if not authorized.\n\nLooking at the second event, 'WmiPrvSE.exe' is involved in loading 'taskschd.dll'. WMI-related processes can sometimes be used by malware for persistence or privilege escalation, so this might be worth noting.\n\nThe third and fourth events involve 'svchost.exe' making registry changes. SvcHost is a common process that hosts various services, but it's often targeted by malware because of its legitimate behavior. Multiple registry writes from the same process could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThen there are several more entries where svchost.exe creates files in the Task directory. The file path 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum' seems unusual and might be a custom location for a scheduled task or some other persistence mechanism.\n\nThere's an event where a remote command is executed, which could indicate some form of remote control or execution via powershell.exe again. This adds to the suspicion because executing commands remotely without proper authorization can be malicious.\n\nAnother entry shows powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData folder. The path 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive' seems specific, and if this is created by an external script or command, it might be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking further, there are several registry writes from chrome.exe, which is unexpected. Chrome shouldn't typically make these changes unless there's some extension or malicious script running within it. This could indicate that the browser is being exploited or that a malicious extension is present.\n\nThere are multiple entries where chrome.exe queries the DNS. While this is normal for browsing activity, the frequency and combination with other events might raise flags if they're part of a larger campaign.\n\nFinally, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating some configuration files. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool used for log management, but seeing it create new config files in its own directory isn't unusual on its own unless it's deviating from standard behavior.\n\nPutting all these together, the suspicious activities include multiple powershell executions creating scheduled tasks with high privileges, svchost.exe making unauthorized registry changes and file creations, and chrome.exe performing unexpected actions like registry writes and DNS queries. These patterns could indicate a potential malware infection or malicious activity aiming to establish persistence on the system. The combination of these events across different processes suggests a coordinated effort that might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities, including powershell.exe creating a scheduled task with high privileges, svchost.exe making registry changes, and chrome.exe performing unexpected actions. These events suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
