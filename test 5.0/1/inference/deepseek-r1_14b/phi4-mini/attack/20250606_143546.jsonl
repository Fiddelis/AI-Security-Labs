I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. \n\nLooking at each event, it seems like multiple entries are from svchost.exe creating files in various locations. The paths look legitimate, like UpdateAgent.dll, Mitigation.dll, etc., which are standard parts of Windows updates. There's also some registry activity from the same process.\n\nI should consider if these activities are normal or suspicious. Svchost.exe is a known Windows process and often used by legitimate services. However, it can sometimes be used by malware as well because it's a common process name. But in this case, most of the actions seem related to file creation under SoftwareDistribution, which is where Windows stores update-related files.\n\nThere are a few events from backgroundTaskHost.exe and msedgewebview2.exe loading image files, but these also seem normal. The repeated registry writes by svchost.exe could be concerning, but again, it's part of standard system operations.\n\nI don't see any signs of immediate malicious activity here, like known bad file paths or unexpected processes. However, the high frequency of events from svchost.exe and the specific files created might warrant closer inspection to ensure they're part of legitimate updates.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe creating files in Windows update directories and registry modifications, which may indicate potential system compromise or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is setup.exe creating a file in the EdgeCore directory. That seems normal for software installations, probably nothing malicious here.\n\nNext up, RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows' User Account Control, so that's a standard operation. No red flags there.\n\nThen there are multiple entries from powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities, but it's also widely used for legitimate admin tasks. So I need to look closer at what these commands are doing.\n\nI see one event where powershell.exe is run with a command line that includes creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a specific binary path and then starting the service. That looks suspicious because creating services can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware. The binary path seems arbitrary, which might indicate it's trying to hide its true nature.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe accesses different system components like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are legitimate parts of .NET but could also be used maliciously if the script is exploiting them.\n\nAnother event shows a file being created in the user's Temp directory with a PowerShell script name, followed by deleting it. This pattern—creating and then immediately deleting a script—is often seen in attempts to bypass certain security policies or delete evidence after execution.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Registry writes from services.exe. While services.exe is legitimate for managing system services, repeated registry modifications without clear purpose could be concerning, especially if combined with other activities like service creation.\n\nPutting it all together: the use of PowerShell to create a new service with an unusual name and path, coupled with the file creation\/deletion in Temp, suggests potential malicious activity. The multiple registry writes might indicate an attempt to establish persistence or alter system configurations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell activities including service creation and file operations that could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with specific command lines. One command line has a PowerShell script path that's quite long and includes an Invoke-entrada_principal command. That stands out because PowerShell scripts can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The use of a custom script, especially one named with 'registro_comum' which translates to 'common register', might indicate something suspicious.\n\nNext, the logs show powershell.exe accessing various system files like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. These are standard .NET framework components, so that alone isn't concerning. However, when combined with the earlier script execution, it raises a flag because attackers often use legitimate processes to hide their tracks.\n\nThere's also an interesting sequence where powershell.exe creates a file in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1 and then immediately deletes it. This behavior is common in malware to test if certain policies are enforced, like script execution in PowerShell. The deletion might be an attempt to cover tracks, but the fact that this happened suggests there's something to investigate.\n\nLooking at other processes, I see svchost.exe creating files and modifying registry values. While svchost is a legitimate process used by many services, unusual file creations or registry modifications can indicate malicious activity, especially if they're happening alongside powershell.exe actions.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries of Registry value sets from different executables like RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, and sppsvc.exe. While these could be normal system operations, the volume and combination with other events might suggest something more is going on.\n\nTaking all this into account, the batch shows a series of actions that could indicate potential malicious behavior. The repeated powershell.exe activity, including script execution and file deletions in Temp, along with other processes modifying files and registry entries, makes me think this warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts, creating temporary files, and deleting them suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nThe first event is from svchost.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download with a specific path. That's a bit concerning because svchost is often used by malware, but it can also be legitimate since it's a Windows process. I'll note that.\n\nNext, there's another file creation event for the WindowsUpdate log file. That seems normal as part of update processes, so probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen, several events show svchost.exe setting registry values multiple times. Registry modifications are common but could indicate malicious activity if they're creating or changing known bad keys. Since this happens seven times in a row, it's worth watching—maybe it's setting up persistence mechanisms?\n\nLooking further down, there are events from MpSigStub.exe, which is related to Windows Defender. It loaded a DLL and created several files in the Temp directory. This seems normal for antivirus operations, especially when updating signatures or handling threats.\n\nThere are also multiple FileCreate tasks by MpSigStub.exe creating various files with long names that include version numbers. These could be temporary files during updates, which is typical behavior for legitimate processes.\n\nThen, setup.exe creates some files in the EdgeCore directory. This looks like part of an installation process, perhaps an update or new software deployment. Setup.exe is commonly used for installations, so unless there's a known malicious variant here, it might not be suspicious.\n\nPutting all this together: svchost.exe doing multiple registry writes could be a red flag, but without more context on what keys are being changed, it's hard to say definitively. The rest of the events seem routine—update logs, antivirus activities, and software installations. However, the repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe might indicate some malicious activity or unauthorized changes.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because of those multiple registry writes from svchost.exe. While not conclusive on their own, they could be part of a larger malicious process like creating persistence or dropping files later.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and file creations in the SoftwareDistribution directory may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first four entries all have the same process name: tarefa_logico.exe. Each one is loading a different DLL file from various system directories like System32 and Microsoft.NET. These look like normal operations since .NET frameworks are common on Windows systems, but I'm noting that these are all image load events which could be part of legitimate processes or potential malicious activities.\n\nNext, there's an event involving powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory under the user's AppData folder. That caught my attention because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and persistence. Creating a profile here might indicate some automated task setup, which could be suspicious.\n\nThen, I see two events where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. The files involved point to a .ps1 script located at C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. This script is being executed remotely, which is another red flag because remote execution scripts can be used for malicious purposes like downloading payloads or executing commands on a compromised system.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events with the same command line that import the componentAuxiliary PowerShell script and attempt to execute Invoke-entrada_principal. The fact that this script is imported and executed multiple times might suggest an attempt at persistence or repeated execution attempts, possibly trying different methods to ensure it runs successfully.\n\nAdditionally, some of these events involve creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" using powershell.exe. This involves setting up a binary path pointing to tarefa_logico.exe and starting the service. Creating services with PowerShell can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malware to start automatically on system boot, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nThe events also mention tasks like Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle, which relate to how PowerShell handles modules and script execution. Malicious scripts might abuse these lifecycle events to ensure they run at appropriate times or to hide their activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe to execute external scripts, create services, and load potentially suspicious DLLs could indicate malicious activity. The paths involved are not standard system directories but rather user-defined ones, which makes them more suspicious. Furthermore, the consistent execution patterns suggest a possible attack campaign or an attempt to establish persistence on the system.\n\nI'm also considering if these activities might be part of legitimate operations, like system administration scripts, but given the combination of multiple remote executions and service creations, it seems more likely than not that this batch is relevant for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing external scripts, creating services, and loading DLLs suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I see a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event.\n\nFirst, looking at the first few events: they all have the same command line involving powershell.exe creating and starting a service named \"objeto_ativo\". That's using New-Service and Start-Service cmdlets. Powershell is often used for malicious activities because it's versatile and can execute scripts easily. Creating a new service could be a way to maintain persistence on a system, which is a red flag.\n\nThen, there are several events where the task in winlog is \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\". Those terms sound like they're related to service creation or management. Since we already saw the powershell commands creating a service, these logs might be part of that process. So this could indicate an attacker setting up long-term access.\n\nNext, there's a group of events where winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path points to C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1. The fact that it's executing a remote command suggests potential lateral movement or execution of malicious scripts. If this script is being run multiple times, maybe it's part of an automated attack or a repeated attempt to execute something.\n\nThen, there are some events where the process is services.exe and the task is \"Logon\". Services.exe is legitimate for handling service-related tasks, but combined with logon events, it might indicate a service starting under a specific user context. If this is happening after other suspicious activities, it could be part of an attack chain.\n\nLooking at the frequency: there are multiple repeated entries, especially the remote command executions and service creations. This repetition could be a sign of automated or script-based attacks trying to establish persistence or execute malicious code.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events have \"process\": None. That might mean the event isn't capturing the actual process name, which can happen in certain log configurations. However, the combination with remote command execution is still concerning.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple powershell commands creating services and executing remote scripts, along with service-related lifecycle events. These could be indicators of an attacker attempting to install a backdoor or establish persistence on the system. Services are common targets for such attacks because they run at startup and can provide persistent access.\n\nThe repeated attempts might indicate that something is being tested or deployed multiple times, possibly by different vectors or as part of a larger campaign. The specific file paths and command-line arguments don't ring any immediate bells as known malicious ones, but the behavior itself—creating services via powershell, executing remote scripts—is concerning on its own.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being \"INTERESTING\" because while some events might not be outright malicious, the combination of actions could indicate suspicious activity. The confidence isn't super high (maybe around 0.7) because there's no clear evidence of known malware here, but the behavior patterns are definitely in line with common attack vectors.\n\nSo overall, yes, this batch should be looked into further for potential malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe creating and starting a service, along with remote command executions pointing to the same script file. These actions could indicate suspicious or malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst off, the logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. Each event has three keys: process, winlog, and file. Looking at the first few entries, I notice that \"process\" is listed as None, which might mean there's no associated process information or it's not captured in these logs.\n\nThe \"winlog\" field seems to be capturing Windows log events. For most of the entries, the task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. This makes me think that someone or something is executing commands remotely on the system. The path provided in the file field is consistently pointing to the same PowerShell script: 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. That's a bit of a mouthful, but breaking it down, \"componente_auxiliar\" translates to \"auxiliary component\" in Portuguese. So, maybe this script is part of some system component or module.\n\nI also notice that there are multiple entries with the same task and file path. Specifically, there are 18 events where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' pointing to that PowerShell script, followed by one event where the task changes to 'Windows Update Agent' with no file path, and then two more back to 'Execute a Remote Command'.\n\nNow, considering all these events together, I have to assess whether this batch should be classified as interesting for investigation. Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nOne possibility is that this script is part of legitimate system operations. If the auxiliary component is a standard part of the system, maybe it's being executed remotely as part of updates or maintenance. But on the other hand, remote command execution can be a red flag because it could indicate unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n\nThe repetition of the same file path and task suggests either automated legitimate processes or potentially malicious scripts running multiple times. I should consider how often such commands are executed in a normal environment. If this script runs frequently for updates or backups, then these logs might not be unusual. However, if it's something that doesn't typically run so often, especially with 'Execute a Remote Command', it could signal something suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that all events except one are identical makes me think of possible log spamming or an attempt to mask other activities by flooding the logs with similar entries. But without more context on what this script does, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nI'm also considering whether 'Windows Update Agent' is a legitimate task. Windows Update is part of normal system operations, so that one event might not raise flags on its own. However, combined with the remote command executions, it could be part of an attack vector where attackers use update mechanisms to execute malicious scripts.\n\nAnother angle is to look at the file path structure. The path has a lot of backslashes and is quite long, which isn't inherently suspicious but might indicate that the script is located in a non-standard directory. If this directory isn't typically used for such scripts, it could be worth investigating.\n\nI'm also thinking about how these events are timestamped. Without knowing when they occurred, I can't determine if there's an unusual spike in activity. But given that there are 18 instances of the same event, even spread out over time, it might still warrant attention depending on the system's normal behavior.\n\nIn terms of indicators, 'Execute a Remote Command' is a broad term but could be linked to remote execution attacks like those involving PowerShell scripts, which are often used in ransomware or other malicious activities. The consistent use of the same script path suggests that this command might be part of a larger campaign or repeated attempts.\n\nI should also think about whether this activity aligns with known attack patterns. For example, attackers might drop a script on a system and execute it multiple times to ensure persistence or to carry out different parts of an attack. The fact that the file path includes 'registro_secundario' (secondary register) could imply some kind of logging or auxiliary functionality, but without knowing its purpose, it's hard to tell.\n\nConsidering all these points, while there isn't enough direct evidence of malicious activity, the combination of repeated remote command executions targeting the same script and the potential for this to be part of an attack vector makes me lean towards classifying this batch as interesting. The high number of identical events could indicate something amiss, even if it's not immediately clear what that might be.\n\nHowever, I'm also aware that legitimate scripts can execute remotely without any malicious intent, especially in environments where remote administration is common. So, without more context or additional indicators like unusual process creation, network connections, or changes to system files, the confidence level isn't extremely high, but it's still notable enough to warrant closer inspection.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events indicating repeated remote command execution on a specific script may suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
