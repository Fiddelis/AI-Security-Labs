The files are all different .dll.mui files located in various subfolders within the same temporary directory.\n\nHmm, Dism.exe is related to the Deployment Image Service Manager, which I know is used for servicing Windows images and deploying updates. It's a legitimate Microsoft tool. So when it's running, it might access various system files as part of its operations.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\... and have different provider names like GenericProvider.dll.mui, IBSProvider.dll.mui, etc. The consistent naming pattern suggests these are localized resource files for various components.\n\nSince each event is generated by Dism.exe detecting a file executable, this seems to be part of its normal operation during image servicing or updates.

All the events are JSON objects with three main fields: process, winlog, and file.\n\nFirst, I notice that every event has \"process\" as Dism.exe. That's interesting because I know Dism is related to Windows deployment services. It's usually used for tasks like servicing an OS image or deploying Windows. So seeing it in logs might be normal during installations or updates.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, most events are about 'File Executable Detected' with a specific rule name. This suggests that the system detected executable files being created or accessed. The one exception is an event where the task is 'File created'. That's a bit different but still related to file operations.\n\nThe file paths all point to temporary directories under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with various DLL and EXE files. These are typically used by applications during runtime or for caching. The naming conventions like DismCore.dll, DismHost.exe, and locale-specific .mui files indicate these might be part of the Windows servicing stack.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like Dism.exe is creating or accessing several executables and DLLs in a temp directory. This could happen during a normal system update or when deploying a new OS image. Since all activities are related to legitimate Dism operations and file creation\/access for servicing purposes, there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access, encryption, or other red flags that would suggest malware. The repeated detection of executables might be due to the system monitoring these files as part of its normal operation.\n\nSo, the batch doesn't seem concerning.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, the logs show multiple instances of powershell.exe being executed. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. That's already a red flag because attackers often use it to execute commands and hide their tracks. \n\nLooking at the command line arguments in one of the events: \n`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command  $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\\\inf\\\\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\\\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\\\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;`\nThis script is checking for specific patterns in .inf files, which are often used by malware or scripts to modify system configurations. The fact that it's using a foreach loop over these files and looking for a particular regex suggests it might be trying to detect something on the system, possibly malicious.\n\nThen there are multiple events where powershell.exe loads various DLLs like clrjit.dll, mscoree.dll, etc. While these could be normal for Powershell scripts, especially those involving .NET, repeated loading of such files can sometimes indicate suspicious activity or attempts to hide processes.\n\nAnother point is the use of cmd.exe and Dism.exe with specific command-line arguments:\n`cmd.exe \/c Dism \/online \/Disable-Feature \/FeatureName:Windows-Defender \/Remove \/NoRestart \/quiet`\n`Dism.exe  \/online \/Disable-Feature \/FeatureName:Windows-Defender \/Remove \/NoRestart \/quiet`\nThese commands are attempting to disable Windows Defender, which is a crucial security component. Disabling it without legitimate reason could be an attempt to lower the system's defenses, making it easier for malware to operate.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation events by powershell.exe and Dism.exe in various directories like Temp and AppData. These temporary files might be part of malicious payloads or tools being executed on the system.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows a series of activities that could indicate an attempt to disable security features (Windows Defender), use Powershell for potentially malicious scripting, and create temporary files which might be part of attack tools. These actions collectively raise suspicion as they often correlate with adversarial tactics to gain persistence or disrupt system defenses.\n\nI'm not seeing any clear indicators of normal administrative tasks; disabling Windows Defender is unusual unless done for a specific reason that's documented, but the combination here looks more like an attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe and Dism.exe with potentially malicious intent, including disabling Windows Defender and creating temporary files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Each line is a JSON object, and there are 14 events in total. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of each event, it seems to have three main fields: process, winlog, and file. The process field always shows 'Dism.exe' as the name. I remember that Dism.exe is related to Deployment Image Service Installer, which is part of Windows for managing image files, like installing or updating Windows.\n\nThe winlog field in each event mentions a task called 'File Executable Detected' with a specific rule named 'FileExecutableDetected'. This sounds like it's triggered by the system detecting an executable file being accessed or executed. That makes sense because when Dism.exe runs, it might be extracting or deploying various files.\n\nNow, looking at the file paths in each event. The path is pointing to different DLL files inside a temporary directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\. Each event has a unique DLL file, like WimProvider.dll.mui, FfuProvider.dll, FolderProvider.dll, and so on. These seem to be provider files for different functionalities within Windows.\n\nPutting this together, it looks like Dism.exe is executing each of these DLL files as part of its normal operation. The system logs are flagging each executable file detection, which is expected when deploying or updating the system image because Dism.exe would extract multiple components from the image.\n\nI should check if these events are typical during a legitimate Windows update or installation process. From what I know, Dism.exe often extracts files to temporary directories and runs them as part of updates. So seeing multiple FileExecutableDetected events for different DLLs would be normal in such scenarios.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the same user account (fiddelis) is performing these actions. If this user is an admin or part of a group with elevated privileges, it's even more expected since Dism.exe requires administrative privileges to perform deployments.\n\nAre there any anomalies? The file paths don't seem suspicious; they're within the standard temporary directory structure. There's no indication that these DLLs are malicious in their names or paths. They sound like legitimate system components.\n\nI should also think about the frequency of these events. Having 14 such events in a short period might be normal during an update, but if it's happening too often or outside of expected maintenance periods, it could raise flags. However, without additional context on timing and other related logs, I can't say for sure.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch doesn't show signs of malicious activity. Each event is part of a legitimate process by Dism.exe during system deployment or update.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file execution events from Dism.exe accessing standard system DLLs during legitimate Windows operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if the entire set is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see events where 'Dism.exe' is involved. The tasks are related to file executables being detected. So Dism.exe is a known system process used for deployment services in Windows. It's legitimate, but sometimes it can be abused by malware if it's extracting or running malicious files.\n\nNext, there's an event with 'DismHost.exe'. This is the main executable for DISM (Deployment Image Service and Management). The command line shows a UUID, which seems normal as part of its operation. Then there are multiple Image Load events from DismHost.exe, each loading different DLLs into memory.\n\nThe file paths point to various .dll files in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder. These DLLs have names like 'VhdProvider.dll', 'WimProvider.dll', etc. These seem related to different providers that DISM might use for handling different image formats or operations.\n\nSo, putting this together: The events show normal operations of Dism.exe and DismHost.exe loading various provider modules into memory. Since these are legitimate system processes, the activities described don't indicate any malicious behavior on their own. There's no sign of unusual file accesses, network connections, or other red flags that would suggest an attack.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't seem to warrant further investigation as it appears to be standard DISM operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal operations of Dism.exe and DismHost.exe loading legitimate provider modules.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events are related to processes involving DismHost.exe and Dism.exe. The initial few entries show \"Image loaded\" tasks for various DLL files in a temporary directory. That seems normal because these could be legitimate operations during system setup or updates.\n\nThen, starting from the 4th event, there's a shift. Now it's Dism.exe performing \"File Delete logged\" tasks. Each of these is deleting specific DLL and MUI files from the same temp directory. The pattern here is multiple deletions in quick succession, which catches my attention.\n\nThe combination of loading images and then deleting them in bulk might indicate some unusual activity. While Dism.exe is a known Windows tool for image servicing, its use outside of standard operations could be suspicious. Also, deleting multiple files that were previously loaded could suggest an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after malicious actions.\n\nI'm thinking about possible scenarios. Could this be part of a legitimate update process? Maybe, but the volume and specific file types make it less likely. Malware might load components and then delete them to avoid detection, leaving traces in logs that are easier to overlook.\n\nThe fact that all these events are from the same temp directory adds to the suspicion. It's not common for system processes to delete so many files unless something is wrong or malicious.\n\nTaking into account all these factors, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it shows a sequence of actions that could be indicative of malicious behavior, despite some possibilities of legitimate use.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletions by Dism.exe after loading image files from a temporary directory suggest potential malicious activity or unusual system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got a batch of events here in JSONL format. Each line is a JSON object representing some system activity. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nLooking at each event, they all have the same structure: the process name is \"Dism.exe\", the winlog task is \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\", and the file paths vary but follow a similar pattern. \n\nI know that Dism.exe is related to Windows Deployment Services. It's used for servicing and deployment operations, like installing or updating drivers, managing system images, etc. So when it runs, it might need to delete temporary files.\n\nThe file paths in each event point to different .dll.mui files located in a Temp directory under the user's AppData folder. The naming conventions vary (e.g., DmiProvider.dll.mui, FfuProvider.dll.mui), but they all seem to be part of the same larger operation since they share the same path structure and are being deleted by the same process.\n\nNow, considering that these are file deletion events logged by the system, it's important to determine if this activity is normal or suspicious. Since Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool, its execution and associated file operations are expected during certain maintenance tasks. The fact that multiple files are being deleted might indicate that Dism.exe is cleaning up temporary files after an operation, which is standard behavior.\n\nI don't see any red flags here, like unusual file names or locations outside the Temp directory. All events are similar, suggesting a single batch of deletions rather than scattered activities over time, which could be more concerning if spread out. \n\nSo, putting this together, these events likely represent normal system operations. There's no indication of malicious behavior in the combination of these events. Therefore, I classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletion events by Dism.exe cleaning temporary files, indicating normal system operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are five events from Dism.exe deleting files in the same temporary directory. Dism is a legitimate Windows tool used for image servicing, so deletions here might be normal during cleanup processes. However, the fact that multiple DLLs are being deleted could be suspicious if they're part of system operations and shouldn't be removed.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell event creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This location is typically for user profile data, but having a PowerShell script here might indicate some automated process or persistence mechanism. I should note that.\n\nThen, services.exe modifying the registry isn't unusual since it's part of Windows services management. But paired with other events, it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nSppsvc.exe loading taskschd.dll seems normal as it's related to software protection and scheduling.\n\n_svhost.exe accessing the registry again might be standard, but combined with PowerShell activity, it's something to consider.\n\nMultiple ProcessAccess events from powershell.exe could indicate script execution or data access. The command line showing \"& {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}\" is a red flag because it explicitly deletes files in the Temp directory. This suggests malicious activity as deleting arbitrary files can be part of data exfiltration or destruction.\n\nAlso, there's a FileDeleteDetected event where PowerShell deleted a .ps1 file in the user's Temp folder. That could mean an attempt to remove traces of the script or prevent analysis.\n\nConsidering all these events together: legitimate system processes (Dism deletions, services.exe, sppsvc.exe) but also signs of malicious activity like PowerShell deleting files in Temp and using pipes for communication. The combination makes it suspicious because while some actions are normal, others point towards potential attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletion events by Dism.exe targeting temporary DLLs and a PowerShell script deleting files in the Temp directory suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm given a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event where the process name is Dism.exe deleting various files from a specific path.\n\nFirst, I know that Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and servicing of Windows images. It's often involved in tasks like installing updates or servicing the OS, so it's not inherently malicious.\n\nLooking at each event, they all show the same process name (Dism.exe) performing file deletions. The files being deleted are DLLs with names like TransmogProvider.dll.mui, UnattendProvider.dll.mui, and others. These seem to be temporary or localized resource files, which Dism.exe might delete as part of its normal operations when cleaning up after servicing.\n\nThe path mentioned is within the Temp folder under a specific GUID directory. Temporary directories are common in Windows for handling tasks that don't need permanent storage. The fact that multiple files are being deleted from here doesn't raise immediate red flags, especially since Dism.exe is known to create and delete such temporary files during its operations.\n\nI'm also considering whether the number of events matters. There are 15 entries all performing similar actions. While a high volume might sometimes indicate an issue, in this case, it seems within the normal scope for Dism.exe processing.\n\nAnother point is that each event has consistent logging: task is 'File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)'. This suggests that the system is monitoring file deletions, which could be part of standard security measures but doesn't indicate malicious activity on its own.\n\nI'm thinking about whether there's anything unusual in the paths or filenames. The GUID in the path seems random, but it's typical for temporary directories to have unique names to prevent conflicts. The .mui files are usually language-pack related, which again is normal for a system that handles multiple locales or updates.\n\nSince all events involve the same process and similar file operations without any signs of deviation (like writing to unexpected locations or accessing restricted areas), there's no strong indication of malicious behavior here.\n\nI also recall that legitimate processes often log their actions, especially when dealing with critical system files. Dism.exe is part of the Windows operating system, so its activity shouldn't be suspicious in this context.\n\nIn summary, each event looks like a standard operation by a legitimate process. Without evidence of deviations from normal behavior or additional indicators like multiple failed attempts, unusual file locations, or other anomalies, I don't see any reason to classify this batch as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate activity by Dism.exe deleting temporary files during normal operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to understand what's going on here. I'm looking at these logs from a system, and there are several entries related to PowerShell processes. The first log entry seems to be about an event with a long GUID and some process details, but the subsequent ones focus on powershell.exe commands.\n\nThe second entry shows that someone is running a PowerShell command with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. That usually means it's executing a script or command in a restricted environment to prevent malicious code from running. The command itself is simply writing \"Final result: 1\" to the host, which seems benign, but I wonder why they're doing this.\n\nThen there are multiple entries where the same PowerShell command is being executed. This command checks for INF files in the Windows directory and looks for a specific pattern related to defaultinstall sections in different architectures (x86, amd64, etc.). If it finds such a pattern, it sets $Res to 1 and breaks out of the loop, then writes the result.\n\nHmm, so this script is scanning system INF files. These files are typically used during driver installations, containing configuration information. The presence of \"[defaultinstall.ntx86]\" or similar sections might indicate that the script is looking for installed drivers or components related to certain hardware or software.\n\nWhy would someone be checking these INF files? Maybe they're trying to enumerate installed drivers, possibly to check for vulnerabilities or specific versions. It could be a system administrator verifying driver installations or part of a larger script for inventory purposes. However, considering the process is being logged multiple times, it might indicate that this command is part of a scheduled task or automated script running periodically.\n\nThe fact that it's using Write-Host suggests it's just displaying the result and not doing anything else with it. But since it's checking for specific sections in INF files, there could be more to it if combined with other scripts or commands.\n\nI'm also noticing that each entry has a 'winlog' field indicating tasks like Provider Lifecycle, which relates to Windows Event Tracing or similar logging mechanisms. This might mean that the system is tracking these processes as part of its monitoring framework.\n\nOverall, this activity doesn't seem immediately malicious on its own, but it's always good to verify what exactly is being checked in the INF files and ensure that the script has proper authorization. It could be a legitimate administrative task or something more nefarious if unauthorized.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that a PowerShell command was executed multiple times with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The command scans for specific patterns in INF files located in the Windows directory, checking for sections related to defaultinstall.nt[architecture]. This suggests that the script is attempting to identify installed drivers or components based on these sections. While the activity itself doesn't appear malicious, it's important to verify the origin and purpose of this script, especially if unauthorized access is suspected. If this process is not expected or authorized, further investigation into its source and actions is recommended."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line seems to represent an event with process info, Windows log details, and possibly some file data.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events involve PowerShell commands. That's already a bit concerning because attackers often use PowerShell for malicious activities due to its powerful scripting capabilities and default presence on Windows systems. So, the fact that there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed catches my attention.\n\nLooking at the command lines, I see two types of scripts. The first type runs a script that checks for specific patterns in INF files located in the Windows directory. It's searching for lines like '[defaultinstall.nt...]' which might relate to driver installation or other system configurations. While legitimate administrative tasks could involve checking INF files, the fact that it's automated and run multiple times makes me think about potential reconnaissance activities. Maybe an attacker is trying to identify installed drivers or system components.\n\nThe second type of command is using PowerShell to remove specific files from the TEMP directory. The exact file pattern being removed is '*entrada_principal.zip'. This seems a bit unusual because why would someone need to delete ZIP files from the TEMP folder? It could be part of cleaning up after dropping malicious payloads, or it might be an attempt to erase evidence.\n\nAnother point I'm considering is the repetition of these events. There are multiple entries with similar command lines and log tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. This suggests that either a script is being run multiple times in a loop or perhaps different parts of the system's service lifecycle are triggering these commands. The repetition could indicate testing or probing behavior, which might be part of an attack chain.\n\nThe files involved don't seem to raise red flags on their own, but combined with the PowerShell usage and the specific patterns they're targeting, it feels like there's more going on here. It's possible that this activity is related to privilege escalation, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement within a network.\n\nI'm also thinking about how these events might fit together as part of an attack. The first script could be gathering information about the system (like installed drivers), and the second could be removing files to cover tracks or clean up after dropping malicious payloads. Together, they form a pattern that's consistent with early stages of an attack, such as reconnaissance and initial access.\n\nThe fact that these events are spread across different log tasks might be intentional, perhaps to avoid detection by making each individual event look less suspicious. But when viewed collectively, especially considering the repeated commands and file operations, it becomes more concerning.\n\nIn summary, while each individual event might not be overtly malicious, the combination of multiple PowerShell activities targeting specific system files and directories raises enough red flags to warrant closer investigation. There's a plausible narrative here that these actions are part of an attack campaign, making this batch of events definitely interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands show potential malicious activity including file deletion and INF file scanning.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
