{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connections detected. That's a bit concerning because while Chrome does make network requests, having several such events in quick succession might indicate something unusual, especially if they're to unexpected domains or IPs.\n\nNext, I notice that powershell.exe is involved in creating files and modifying registry values. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate admin tasks, but it can also be a red flag because malicious actors often use it for command execution and lateral movement. The file created by powershell.exe is named 'componente_auxiliar.txt' which doesn't immediately ring any bells as suspicious, but I should consider if this filename could be part of known malware.\n\nLooking at the winlogbeat.exe process, it's creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is an agent used for forwarding logs to Elasticsearch, so this seems normal unless there's something off in how it's being configured or accessed.\n\nThere are also several registry modifications by both chrome.exe and powershell.exe. Registry changes can be part of legitimate operations but are often used by malware to persistence or alter system configurations maliciously.\n\nThe event where SDXHelper.exe loads urlmon.dll could be concerning. URLMON is a known DLL used in Windows for handling URLs, so while this might not be inherently suspicious, the context of how it's being loaded and by which process can matter. If SDXHelper.exe is associated with known malware, this would raise an eyebrow.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple indicators that could suggest malicious activity. The combination of network connections from Chrome, file creation by PowerShell, registry modifications, and DLL loading might indicate a potential attack vector or exfiltration attempts. However, without more context on the specific events (like exact URLs, file contents, or known malware signatures), it's hard to be certain.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because while each event individually could be benign, together they show a pattern that might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of network connections and registry modifications from chrome.exe, along with file creation by powershell.exe, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That seems normal because browsers do that all the time. Next, whoami.exe running—also common, maybe just a user checking their permissions.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe accessed. PowerShell can be used for good or bad things, so I should keep an eye on it. The next event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which makes sense if that's the log shipping tool they're using.\n\nAnother powershell.exe accessing something—maybe executing commands or fetching data. Then cmd.exe running with certutil to encode calc.exe into some text files. Hmm, I've heard that calc.exe can be used as a calculator but also sometimes in malicious ways, like encoding malicious code.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances of certutil being used for both encoding and decoding files. That's suspicious because encoding\/decoding can hide malicious content. Also, cmd.exe is involved again with similar commands.\n\nThere's rundll32.exe calling PcaSvc.dll—sounds legitimate but sometimes_dlls can be vectors for attacks. Then SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll multiple times. Those are system files, so maybe nothing wrong there, but repeated loads could indicate something is off.\n\nFinally, chrome.exe setting a registry value again—it's common for apps to interact with the registry, but combined with all the other events, it might be part of a larger pattern.\n\nPutting this together: there are multiple instances where tools like certutil and cmd are being used in ways that can encode\/decode files. This is often seen in malware campaigns to hide malicious payloads. Also, the repeated use of these commands across different processes could indicate scripting or automated behavior, which might be part of an attack.\n\nSo overall, while some events on their own aren't alarming, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. I'm not 100% certain but there's enough red flags to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of potentially suspicious activities, including unusual file operations and process creations involving tools like certutil.exe and cmd.exe which are often used in malicious scripts.
