{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. First off, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity here, which immediately raises my suspicion because attackers often use PowerShell for command execution and lateral movement.\n\nLooking closer, several entries show that PowerShell is being executed with specific commands. The command lines include commands like 'net user', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', 'ls C:\\Users', and others. These seem to be enumerating user accounts, group memberships, accessing the Windows Defender directory, and listing directories, which are common techniques for reconnaissance.\n\nThere's also a file creation and deletion event where a script is created in the Temp folder by PowerShell and then immediately deleted. This behavior could indicate an attempt to test privileges or leave no trace after executing malicious code.\n\nThe repeated use of Registry value sets might be attempts to modify system configurations, which could be part of persistence mechanisms or changing system settings to facilitate further attacks.\n\nAdditionally, multiple Image Load events from different DLLs are logged when PowerShell runs. While this isn't inherently suspicious, the combination with other activities makes it notable.\n\nConsidering all these points together—PowerShell execution with potentially malicious commands, file operations in Temp, registry modifications—it's clear that there's a pattern of behavior consistent with an attacker exploring the system and possibly trying to establish persistence or move laterally.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe execution with potentially malicious commands, including user enumeration and file operations in Temp directory.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are a couple of entries with the task \"Security Group Management\" but no process or file info. Not sure about these yet, maybe related to group policy changes?\n\nNext, I see cmdkey.exe being used with \"\/list\". That usually lists cached credentials, which could be part of credential dumping activities. This might indicate something malicious, so that's a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple powershell.exe entries. Powershell is commonly used by attackers for command and control. Seeing it accessed and creating files makes me think someone is using it to execute commands or drop files. Also, the file paths like 'elemento_logico.txt' don't seem standard, which could be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, net.exe and net1.exe are being used with 'localgroup'. These commands can manipulate local group policies, which again fits malicious behavior since attackers often try to gain elevated privileges.\n\nThere are several Registry value sets from different processes like powershell.exe, conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, etc. Modifying the registry is a common way for malware to persistence or change system configurations, so this adds to my concern.\n\nI also notice notepad.exe and calc.exe accessing files and registry, but those might be more innocent unless they're being used as part of a larger script or malicious process.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file seems normal if it's part of log shipping, but without context, it's hard to say. It could also be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nOverall, the combination of cmdkey.exe for credential dumping, multiple powershell accesses and creations, net.exe for group manipulation, and registry changes suggests potential malicious activity. The use of various tools together is a pattern I recognize in attack campaigns. Therefore, this batch seems relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of potentially malicious activities such as command-line tool usage (cmdkey.exe, net.exe), PowerShell accesses and creations, and registry modifications, which may indicate unauthorized system access or credential dumping.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of logs provided in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event, and I need to analyze the entire batch as a whole to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events where PowerShell is being executed with specific command lines. The command lines look like they're trying to do several things: check user accounts, list local groups, access system files, and network-related commands. That immediately raises a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement within a network.\n\nLooking closer at the command line:\n`powershell.exe & {net user\\\\nget-localuser\\\\nget-localgroupmember -group Users\\\\ncmdkey.exe \/list\\\\nls C:\\\/Users\\\\nget-childitem C:\\\\Users\\\\ndir C:\\\\Users\\\\nget-localgroup\\\\nnet localgroup}`\nBreaking this down, it's executing several commands. 'net user' would list users, 'get-localuser' might retrieve local user information, and 'cmdkey.exe \/list' is used to list saved credentials, which could be password dumping. The 'ls C:\\Users', 'dir C:\\Users' suggests they're listing directory contents in the Users folder, possibly looking for sensitive files or trying to access user-specific data.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances of these PowerShell commands across different events, suggesting repeated attempts or part of a larger script execution. This repetition could indicate automated malicious activity rather than normal user behavior.\n\nOther events show processes like 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' being used with the command 'user', which is another way to manipulate user accounts. These could be related commands to gather more information about the system's users or to modify account permissions.\n\nThere are also file-related events where PowerShell loads DLLs like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. While these might seem normal, sometimes malicious scripts load legitimate files to avoid detection or to perform specific tasks that require those modules.\n\nMoreover, I see a lot of 'Security Group Management' and 'User Account Management' tasks in the winlog field. These are often related to changes in user accounts or group policies, which could be signs of privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe fact that some events have null file paths but still involve process creations or accesses suggests that the activity might be memory-based or part of a larger script that doesn't require writing files immediately. This can make it harder to detect because there's no trace on the disk, potentially allowing attackers to remain undetected longer.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell commands with specific actions targeting user information and system configurations, along with repeated process creations and access events, indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity. These behaviors are common in attack chains, such as reconnaissance, credential dumping, and lateral movement, which are critical for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands attempt to gather user information and access system files, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
