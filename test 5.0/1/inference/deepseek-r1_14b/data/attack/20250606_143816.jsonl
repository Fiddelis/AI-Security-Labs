{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: It has a process with command_line showing powershell.exe being executed with some arguments. The command seems suspicious because it's using New-PSDrive with -psprovider filesystem and targeting \\\\Target\\\\C$. This looks like an attempt to map a drive to a remote machine's C$ share, which is often used in attacks for lateral movement.\n\nThe next 18 events all have the same winlog task: 'Execute a Remote Command'. Each of these could be related; maybe they're part of a script or automated process. Since there are so many similar events, it might indicate a repeated attempt to execute commands remotely, which could be malicious.\n\nI'm concerned because the combination of using PowerShell for drive mapping and multiple remote command executions could be signs of an attack. The high volume of remote command tasks stands out as unusual activity that might warrant investigation.\n\nSo, considering all these points together, this batch seems relevant for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious PowerShell activity attempting to map a drive to a remote C$ share and multiple executions of remote commands, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an entry for svchost.exe setting a registry value. That's normal since svchost is a common system process.\n\nNext, sppsvc.exe creates a file in the cache directory. That seems routine too, as it's part of software protection services.\n\nThen, powershell.exe accessing a process and creating another instance catches my attention. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused. The command line showing a PS Drive creation (g:\\Target\\C$) makes me think—accessing remote drives could indicate either admin activity or something malicious like lateral movement in an attack.\n\nThere are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and files, loading various DLLs. Some of these are normal for PowerShell scripts, but the frequency might be suspicious. The creation and subsequent deletion of a script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1) stands out. Creating and then deleting a file quickly is often a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nThe events show powershell.exe interacting with system files and services, which could be part of an attack chain. The overall pattern suggests possible malicious activity, like script testing or persistence mechanisms. Given the number of events related to PowerShell and the specific actions taken, I'm leaning towards this being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and files, including creation and deletion of a script file, may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events, and I need to figure out if it's interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is about powershell.exe being accessed. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that catches my attention. Then there's whoami.exe running, which seems normal since it's often used to check user information.\n\nNext, I see multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing different registry values or files. That repetition makes me think something might be off because why would Powershell access the same things repeatedly? Maybe it's trying to escalate privileges or gather information.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line for powershell.exe that includes downloading a script from GitHub. The URL points to a specific file in a repository called WinPwn, which I'm not familiar with, but GitHub is a common place for sharing both legitimate and malicious scripts. This part is concerning because it indicates an external script is being executed.\n\nAfter that, there are several Image Load events for different DLLs while running Powershell. These might be normal for script execution, but combined with the previous points, they could mean something more suspicious like loading malicious components or tools.\n\nThen, I notice a file creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_0wo2rwkr.dxh.ps1). The fact that it's created and then deleted quickly makes me think it's trying to avoid detection. It might be part of a process to test if certain policies are in place or to execute malicious code without leaving traces.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, which could indicate communication between different processes, possibly for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nLastly, another Registry value set event, which suggests the script might be modifying system configurations to maintain persistence or alter security settings.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple Powershell instances, executing external scripts, creating and deleting temporary files, accessing registry values, loading various DLLs. These activities are red flags for potential malicious behavior. The downloading of a script from an external source, especially a public one like GitHub, increases the suspicion. The repeated events suggest a process that's trying to carry out tasks that might not be legitimate.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of activities points towards possible malicious intent. The confidence is around 0.85 because while some actions are common, the overall pattern and specific script execution make it likely significant.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell instances accessing registry values, downloading an external script from GitHub, creating temporary files which are then deleted, and loading various system DLLs.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. The user mentioned that I should analyze the entire batch as a whole, considering all events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are 18 events in total. Each event has three keys: process, winlog, and file. Most of them have \"None\" for file, which might mean no file activity was captured or it's not relevant here.\n\nLooking at the 'process' field, all except one event have a command line that involves powershell.exe. The command lines are quite long, but I can see they're executing some scripts. Specifically, most of them are downloading code from a GitHub repository and running it with powershell. The URL points to a script called WinPwn.ps1 from the S3cur3Th1sSh1t user's repository.\n\nWait, that repo name sounds familiar—S3cur3Th1sSh1t is known for PowerShell-based attack scripts, often used in cyberattacks. So downloading and executing such scripts could indicate malicious activity. The script being executed includes parameters like 'sensitivefiles', which suggests it might be targeting sensitive files on the system.\n\nAdditionally, some events have a different command line: they're using New-PSDrive to map a drive to \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\". That looks like an attempt to access another machine's C drive over the network, which could be part of lateral movement in an attack.\n\nNow, looking at the 'winlog' field, most tasks are either 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. Provider Lifecycle events often relate to things like driver installations or service changes, while Engine Lifecycle might involve process creation or termination. This combination doesn't immediately ring alarm bells on their own, but combined with the command lines, they support the idea of powershell.exe executing scripts that could be malicious.\n\nThe repetition of these exact same command lines across multiple events suggests this activity is part of a larger campaign. It's not just a one-off; it's happening consistently, which makes me think it's intentional and possibly automated.\n\nSo putting it all together: downloading known malicious scripts using powershell.exe, executing them with parameters that target sensitive files, and attempting to access other machines—these are all red flags for malicious behavior. The consistency across multiple events strengthens the case that this is not accidental but part of an attack.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as interesting because it shows signs of potentially harmful activity. However, since I don't have real-time data or context beyond these logs, my confidence is high but not 100%. There's a chance it could be a false positive, like a legitimate script execution, but given the nature of the scripts and the repeated attempts, it's more likely malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe executing a known malicious script from a suspicious GitHub repository and attempting network access, indicating potential attack behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
