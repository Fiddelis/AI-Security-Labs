The initial entries show chrome doing DNS queries and network connections, which is normal for a browser.\n\nThen, there's a whoami.exe running as a process, but it's just creating a process without any malicious indicators. However, the powershell.exe entries catch my attention because they're doing multiple Registry writes and file operations.\n\nI see powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values, which could be script activity. The command line shows some obfuscated PowerShell code trying to modify file timestamps using Get-ChildItem. This is a red flag because changing file times can indicate tampering with evidence or hiding malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creations and deletions in the Temp directory, which is common for scripts to avoid persistence but could be suspicious. The deletion of the script after execution might be an attempt to clean up traces.\n\nThe combination of these activities—Registry manipulation, file timestamp changes, and temporary file handling—points towards potential malicious behavior, like data exfiltration or system configuration changes. So, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious activities such as registry modifications and file operations, including the creation and deletion of temporary files.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that modify file LastWriteTimes. The commands like `Get-ChildItem` and setting the LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\" seem suspicious because changing file timestamps can be a tactic used in malware or persistence mechanisms to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there are several instances where svchost.exe is modifying registry values. While svchost is a legitimate process, frequent registry changes without clear reason could indicate malicious activity, especially if they're done by another process like PowerShell.\n\nThere's an entry where calc.exe loads urlmon.dll. That's unusual because Calculator typically doesn't need to load such DLLs, which might suggest potential code injection or loading of malicious components.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of powershell.exe creating files in non-standard locations, like the StartupProfileData directory, raises flags. Legitimate PowerShell scripts usually don't create such files during normal operation, and this could be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nOverall, these activities—modifying file times, registry changes, unexpected DLL loads, and suspicious file creations—indicate potential malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are modifying file timestamps and interacting with the registry, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from different processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe. Notably, most of these events involve registry value sets and some file operations. For instance, Chrome is setting multiple registry values, which could be normal since browsers often interact with the registry for settings. However, I should check if there are any deviations from standard behavior.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe has both a registry set and a process access event. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. The presence of multiple registry operations might warrant closer examination because attackers often modify the registry to hide their tracks or alter system configurations.\n\nLooking at the file events, winlogbeat.exe created a configuration file, which seems benign as it's likely setting up log collection. Powershell also created a file named 'unidade_logico.txt', which translates to something like 'logical unit'—not immediately suspicious but could be part of data exfiltration or logging activities.\n\nChrome's events include loading system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are legitimate components. However, multiple registry writes by Chrome might be unusual depending on the version being used.\n\nI'm concerned about the high number of RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe—12 instances just setting values. This could indicate potential tampering or persistence mechanisms, especially if these entries aren't part of known updates or configurations. Additionally, the powershell.exe events could be a red flag for command-line attacks or lateral movement.\n\nThe variety of processes involved and the types of operations they're performing suggest possible malicious activity. While some actions are normal, the combination and frequency might point to an attack vector, such as persistence using registry keys or file creation for data storage. Therefore, I'd classify this batch as interesting due to these potential signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes show unusual activity, including numerous registry modifications by Chrome and PowerShell events suggesting potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
