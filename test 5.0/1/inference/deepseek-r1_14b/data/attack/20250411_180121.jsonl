{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm seeing a lot of process creations and registry events. There are multiple instances of powershell.exe being run with command lines that look suspicious, like \"& {}\", which sometimes is used in PowerShell to execute commands without outputting anything.\n\nI also notice conhost.exe and cmd.exe being used, which can be common for executing malicious scripts or commands. The repeated use of these tools might indicate someone trying to hide their activities or deploying malware.\n\nLooking at the registry events, there are several attempts to delete or modify entries under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This path is often targeted by malware to maintain persistence between reboots. The fact that different processes like reg.exe and cmd.exe are being used suggests an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of whoami.exe might be for privilege escalation or information gathering, which are early steps in a cyberattack. The repeated process creations and accesses could indicate scripting activity, possibly automating malicious tasks.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of process creation with potentially malicious command lines, modifications to the registry that suggest persistence mechanisms, and tools commonly used by attackers. This combination is definitely red flags for potential malicious behavior. I'm confident enough to classify this as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious process creations (e.g., powershell.exe, cmd.exe) and registry modifications indicate possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first five events are from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. That seems normal since Chrome does a lot of network activity. But I shouldn't ignore it; however, on their own, these might not be suspicious unless they're unusually frequent or accessing malicious sites.\n\nNext, there's an event from powershell.exe where a registry value is set. PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also execute malicious commands. The command line here shows a WebClient downloading a file from GitHub to the TEMP directory. That immediately raises a red flag because downloading files from external sources without proper validation could indicate malware or unauthorized access.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, which is normal when scripts run and load necessary libraries. However, combined with the download activity, it adds context that might be suspicious. Then there's a FileCreate event for a PowerShell script in the TEMP folder, followed by a FileDeleteDetected. This sequence—creating and then deleting a script file—is often used by attackers to avoid detection.\n\nThe last three events again show powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub into the TEMP directory via WebClient. Each time, it's using different repository paths but similar commands. The consistency in the command structure suggests automated behavior, possibly part of a larger script or payload being executed multiple times.\n\nPutting all this together, there are multiple instances of PowerShell executing downloads and file operations that could be signs of malicious activity. The repeated downloading from GitHub repositories isn't inherently bad, but without context on what those files contain, it's risky. Additionally, the file creation and deletion pattern is concerning as it can be used to hide malicious activities.\n\nI'm confident enough based on the patterns observed—multiple network connections, downloads via WebClient, script execution, and file manipulation—to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity involving PowerShell downloading files from external sources and executing scripts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system log events. My goal is to determine if these logs are interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first few entries show processes like powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files. Notably, powershell.exe is often used maliciously, but here it might be legitimate since it's part of system operations. Winlogbeat is an agent for log management, so its activity is expected.\n\nNext, I see several Registry-related events from various processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe. The registry is a common target for attackers, but these entries alone don't indicate malicious activity without more context.\n\nLooking further down, there are process creations of whoami.exe, cmd.exe, and schtasks.exe. Schtasks.exe is used to manage scheduled tasks, which can be both legitimate and malicious depending on usage. The command line in one event shows SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F, which suggests deletion of a task named \"spawn.\" This could be either removing a malicious task or part of cleanup.\n\nI also notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessing processes and setting registry values. PowerShell's flexibility makes it a favorite for attackers, but again, without seeing unusual commands or behaviors, it's hard to classify as suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of cmd.exe with SCHTASKS. While this can be legitimate for system admins, in certain contexts, especially with deletion commands, it might warrant closer look if there are no corresponding creations afterward.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a pattern of process creations and deletions, registry modifications, and use of tools that have dual-use capabilities. However, without evidence of failed attempts, known malicious file hashes, or anomalies in timestamps or user activities, the events seem like they could be part of legitimate system maintenance or user actions.\n\nTherefore, while there are some red flags due to the use of powershell.exe and schtasks.exe, the information provided doesn't conclusively point to malicious activity. The confidence is moderate because some behaviors are notable but not definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including PowerShell executions, Registry modifications, and deletion of scheduled tasks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each has \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" fields. \n\nLooking at the first few entries: there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that download files from GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory. For example, one event shows the command_line as 'powershell.exe & {(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/estrutura_temporario\/componente_padrao\/master\/LICENSE.txt\", \"$env:TEMP\\\\tarefa_geral.txt\")}'. This seems suspicious because downloading files from GitHub could be part of a script or malicious activity.\n\nThen, there are events where powershell.exe is just listed as the process name without command_line. But some of these have file creations in specific paths like \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\elemento_padrao.txt\". This might indicate that files are being created during execution, possibly storing something on the system.\n\nNext, there's an event where chrome.exe is setting registry values multiple times. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings, doing so repeatedly could be a red flag if it's unusual behavior or if other indicators are present.\n\nLooking further down, I see that powershell.exe is loading a DLL from \"C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows Defender\\\\Platform...\", which seems legitimate as Windows Defender is a known process. But combined with the previous activity, it might warrant closer look.\n\nAnother event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory; this seems normal unless there's something off about the configuration or timing.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances downloading files from GitHub into TEMP, which could be part of malicious script execution. The repeated registry changes by chrome.exe might indicate something amiss, especially if they're not typical user actions. The file creations in different locations could be parts of a larger campaign or exfiltration.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because it combines several activities that, while individually might not be suspicious, together show potential malicious behavior like script downloads and registry modifications. However, I'm not entirely sure if the chrome.exe activity is part of an attack or just regular updates. Maybe there's a pattern in the times these events occurred or other context missing.\n\nSo, after considering all events, I think the batch is interesting enough to investigate further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe instances downloading files from GitHub into TEMP and creating files in user directories, along with repeated registry modifications by Chrome.exe, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs, and I need to figure out if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, a lot of these events are from powershell.exe. That catches my attention because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and also for malicious activities. The initial few entries show that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. This looks normal because when any program runs on Windows, it loads system libraries.\n\nThen I see a file creation event by powershell.exe: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Creating temporary files isn't unusual, but if this script is doing something malicious, that's a concern. But right after creating it, the same process deletes the file. So maybe it's just testing something or cleaning up after itself.\n\nThere are also Pipe Created events and Engine Lifecycle tasks. Those seem related to how PowerShell interacts with other processes, which is standard behavior.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process that runs without any command specified except \"\/c\". That's odd because usually, you'd see some command following \/c in the command line. This could be suspicious because empty commands might be used to execute other things or create hidden processes.\n\nThere are several Registry value set tasks and Process Create events involving whoami.exe and cmd.exe. The use of whoami.exe is common for getting system information, but without context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nI also notice that some entries have \"None\" for the file path. That could mean there's no associated file action, but in the case of process access or registry events, it might not be a problem.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple powershell.exe instances loading libraries and creating\/deleting temp files, cmd.exe with an empty command line, and some registry accesses. While none of these individually are alarming, the combination might indicate something suspicious. The repeated creation and deletion of the PowerShell script file is a bit concerning because attackers often clean up their tracks.\n\nSo, putting it all together, there's enough unusual activity here that could be indicative of malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch should be classified as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances loading libraries and creating\/deleting temp files, cmd.exe with empty command line, and registry accesses indicate potential suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries that detail various processes and their associated Windows log tasks.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple instances where PowerShell.exe is being executed with different command lines. Sometimes the command line is just \"& {}\" which seems unusual because it's an empty command. This might indicate that the script isn't doing much on the surface or maybe trying to avoid detection by not executing any visible commands.\n\nNext, there are several RegistryEvent tasks associated with cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe. Modifying registry values can be a common tactic in malicious activities because it can allow persistence or change system configurations. The fact that multiple processes are doing this is a red flag.\n\nLooking at the process creation events, especially for PowerShell, I see that they're being created with specific command lines. This could mean that an attacker is using a standard tool but invoking it in a way that's not typical. Since PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes, the context here matters. The repeated use of \"& {}\" suggests that each time it's called, it might be trying to do something without leaving a traceable command line.\n\nThere are also ImageLoad tasks where PowerShell loads various DLLs. While this isn't inherently suspicious, loading multiple specific DLLs could indicate that malicious code is being executed or that certain libraries are being accessed for unintended purposes.\n\nOne event stands out: the creation of a temporary file \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1\" and then its deletion shortly after. This seems like an attempt to create a script on the fly, execute it, and then remove evidence by deleting the file. Such behavior is often seen in malware or attack scripts to avoid detection by security tools.\n\nAdditionally, there are Provider Lifecycle events associated with powershell.exe. While I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of these tasks, they might be related to how PowerShell communicates or loads modules, which could be part of a larger malicious process.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes modifying the registry, repeated and suspicious use of PowerShell with empty command lines, creation and deletion of temporary files, and potential DLL manipulations. These activities collectively suggest possible malicious behavior. However, without more context or evidence of actual exploit attempts or payload execution, it's hard to be certain. But given the combination of these factors, the batch does raise enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe with unusual command lines and activities indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL data provided, each line represents an event with process details, Windows log information, and file paths. There are 19 events in total. \n\nStarting from the beginning, the first few events all involve powershell.exe loading different DLL files. These seem normal because PowerShell often loads various modules when running scripts. I know that anti-virus or system files like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll are legitimate, so those entries don't raise a red flag.\n\nThen, I notice an event where a file is created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. This looks suspicious because it's a PowerShell script being created temporarily, which could be part of malicious activity. However, the next line shows that this file is immediately deleted, which might indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe is used with Remove-Item commands to delete files in the TEMP directory. The paths like tarefa_base.zip and others ending with .zip suggest someone is trying to remove zip files from Temp. This could be part of a script meant to clean up traces, but it's worth investigating why specific files are being deleted.\n\nLooking further down, there are events involving chrome.exe accessing registry values and loading DLLs. These seem normal unless they're deviating from standard behavior, which doesn't appear to be the case here.\n\nI also notice that some events under powershell.exe have command lines showing specific file deletions in the TEMP directory. The consistent use of Remove-Item with different paths could indicate a pattern, possibly an automated cleanup process or something more nefarious like data exfiltration.\n\nConsidering all these points together: multiple instances of creating and deleting temporary PowerShell scripts, along with repeated deletion of files from Temp, raises concerns about potential malicious activity. The batch as a whole shows unusual behavior that might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving PowerShell including creation and deletion of temporary scripts, multiple file deletions in TEMP directory, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm looking at a batch of system log events from different processes on a Windows machine. The goal is to determine if these logs are interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to see what's happening. \n\nStarting with the first line: \"Calculator.exe\" set a registry value. That seems normal because Calculator is a standard app and might need some settings stored in the registry. Nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, we have multiple events from powershell.exe. I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The events include pipe creation, accessing processes, and setting registry values. These actions alone aren't necessarily bad, but repeated or unusual use could be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are several entries where chrome.exe is creating pipes and setting registry values. Chrome might do this for extension management or plugin interactions, so it's not immediately concerning unless the activities are out of the ordinary for the user's behavior.\n\nThere's an event with \"conhost.exe\" setting a registry value. Conhost is usually related to console applications, so that seems benign on its own.\n\nThen I see \"whoami.exe\" being executed. This is a legitimate tool used to check user information, often used in scripts or troubleshooting. However, depending on the context, it could be part of privilege escalation, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, looking at the command lines for some processes:\n- One powershell.exe has \"& {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This script is deleting a specific file in the TEMP directory. The fact that it's using Remove-Item and ignoring errors might indicate that the file wasn't there, but why delete something from TEMP? Maybe it's part of cleaning up after some activity. Alternatively, could this be related to malware trying to remove traces?\n\nAnother powershell.exe event has a command line \"& { ... }\", which is typical for executing scripts or commands in PowerShell. But without seeing the actual script content, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading DLLs like MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll. These seem normal since they're part of Windows Defender and .NET framework respectively, which are legitimate components.\n\nConsidering the overall batch:\n- The volume of PowerShell activity is notable. Multiple instances with various tasks could indicate script execution or automation.\n- The deletion script in one event stands out as potentially suspicious behavior, especially if there's no clear reason for that file to be deleted.\n- The repeated RegistryEvent and ProcessAccess tasks might be part of legitimate operations but could also signify persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"INTERESTING\" because while many events are benign on their own, the combination suggests possible malicious activity. The deletion script is a red flag, and the extensive PowerShell usage could be indicative of command-line attacks or scripts trying to hide traces.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple potentially suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including registry modifications, file deletions, and process accesses, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously, so that's a red flag. There are several process creations and deletions of files in the TEMP directory, like removing tarefa_base.txt and others. These file operations could be part of cleaning up traces or deleting malicious scripts.\n\nLooking at the tasks, there are registry value sets and process accesses. Malware often manipulates the registry to hide itself or alter system configurations. The file creations and deletions also stand out—powershell.exe creating a script in TEMP and then deleting it might indicate an attempt to bypass certain policy checks or execute arbitrary code.\n\nAdditionally, powershell.exe is loading various .NET libraries. While this is normal for scripts, the specific DLLs loaded could be part of obfuscation techniques or attempts to execute malicious commands without being detected by standard tools.\n\nThe batch shows repeated patterns: creating processes, modifying registry, accessing files, and deleting them quickly. This behavior can be indicative of a script trying to stay undetected or remove evidence after execution. The combination of these activities across multiple events increases the suspicion that something malicious is occurring.\n\nConsidering all these points together, this batch seems relevant for further investigation as it exhibits behaviors commonly associated with malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file operations and registry modifications, including deleting files in the TEMP directory.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the JSONL data, there are multiple entries. The first few events involve 'powershell.exe' being accessed and 'whoami.exe' being created as a process. These actions alone aren't necessarily suspicious because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Whoami is also a standard command to check user information.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe is accessed several times without any file operations mentioned in the early events. Then, there's an entry where 'winlogbeat.exe' creates a file in a data directory, which seems normal if it's part of log management software like Winlogbeat. \n\nThe next event after that is another powershell.exe access with a file creation: 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\pacote_ativo.txt'. This stands out because the path includes \"fiddelis\" and has \"pacote_ativo.txt\", which might be Portuguese for \"active package\". I'm thinking this could relate to some kind of malicious script or tool being dropped. \n\nPutting it all together, having multiple powershell.exe accesses followed by a file creation that seems out of place could indicate potential malicious activity. The repetition of accessing PowerShell and the specific file name make me lean towards classifying this as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed without clear purpose, combined with the creation of a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt', which may suggest malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this batch of logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice a lot of PowerShell executions. Each one has a command line that removes specific files from the TEMP directory. For example, \"Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\registro_auxiliar.txt -Force -ErrorAction Ignore\". This seems like an attempt to delete log files or traces, which is common in malware or scripts meant to cover their tracks.\n\nThen there's the process named 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in a specific path. Winlogbeat is typically used for collecting Windows logs, but I should check if this instance is legitimate or part of an attack. The file path seems standard, so maybe it's just setting up its configuration, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, several events show 'powershell.exe' loading the MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's normal since PowerShell uses various system DLLs when running scripts, so I don't think that's suspicious on its own.\n\nThere are multiple registry value sets by processes like powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and RuntimeBroker.exe. While Chrome accessing the registry is typical for extensions or settings, repeated writes might be worth noting if they're unusual in this context.\n\nI also see 'whoami.exe' being executed a couple of times. This is often used to check user permissions or system information, which can be part of reconnaissance activities by attackers.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple PowerShell deletions, process creations, file accesses, and registry modifications spread across different processes. The combination makes me think this could be an attempt at persistence or lateral movement within a network. The repeated use of PowerShell with similar commands for deletion is concerning because it's a common vector for malicious activities.\n\nMoreover, the presence of both 'winlogbeat.exe' and multiple Chrome-related events might indicate an attacker using legitimate tools alongside malicious ones to blend in.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are enough indicators that could point towards potential malicious behavior. The confidence isn't too high because some actions, like registry writes by Chrome or RuntimeBroker, are normal, but the volume of PowerShell deletions and whoami executions raises flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell deletions from TEMP directory suggest potential malicious activity.
