First, I'll go through each event one by one to spot any patterns or unusual activities.\n\nStarting with the first few entries, I see processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe making registry changes. That's common for system operations, so nothing suspicious there. Powershell.exe accessing a process catches my eye because it's often used in scripts, both legitimate and malicious. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNext, Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll seems normal as that's a standard system file. However, when I see svchost.exe setting registry values multiple times, I get cautious. Svchost is usually for services, but some malware can abuse it. Also, the winlogbeat.exe creating a new config file could be related to log management, which might be normal but worth noting.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed with a command line pointing to its own path. That seems odd because whoami typically doesn't need to run itself; maybe trying to hide or misdirect? Powershell.exe continues to show up, accessing processes and modifying the registry. The use of WMIC.exe with a delete command is another red flag because it's a tool often used in remote attacks to terminate processes silently.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing and modifying system components, which could indicate script execution, possibly malicious. The use of cmd.exe and wmic.exe together to delete notepad.exe might be part of an attempt to cover tracks or disrupt monitoring tools. Additionally, the repeated registry writes by svchost and other processes might be setting up persistence mechanisms for potential malware.\n\nThe variety of processes involved—powershell, cmd, wmic, calculator—and their activities collectively suggest a coordinated effort that's more than just regular system operations. These actions could be part of an attack chain, like initial access, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The combination is significant enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious process activities including powershell.exe accessing and modifying system components, cmd.exe and wmic.exe used together potentially for malicious purposes, and unusual registry modifications by svchost.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's start by going through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a process named \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems normal because whoami is often used just to get user information, but sometimes it can be part of malicious activity, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, several events show powershell.exe being accessed and modifying the registry. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripts and malicious activities, like downloading files or executing commands. The fact that there are multiple registry modifications might raise a flag because attackers often use the registry to maintain persistence or hide their tracks.\n\nThen I notice that powershell.exe is creating a file in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. It's created and then deleted right after. That behavior is a bit suspicious because creating a script file only to delete it might indicate an attempt to test something without leaving evidence, which is a common tactic for attackers.\n\nThere are also several events where powershell.exe interacts with different DLL files and other system components like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. This could be part of normal operation since Powershell relies on these libraries, but the combination of multiple file loads might suggest something more nefarious, like loading malicious modules or obfuscating commands.\n\nAdditionally, there are \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events for powershell.exe, which indicate that Powershell is starting up or shutting down. However, the repetition here could mean it's being called multiple times in quick succession, possibly to run multiple commands or scripts.\n\nLooking at the file operations, besides the temporary script file, there's a new configuration file created by winlogbeat.exe. That doesn't seem concerning on its own but might be part of log management.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple Powershell instances accessing the registry, creating and deleting a temp script, loading various DLLs—these are all signs that could point to malicious activity.

I'm given a bunch of events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The user says to analyze all events together, so I can't just look at each one individually.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to see what's happening.\n\n1. The first event involves WMIC.exe loading a DLL file. That seems suspicious because WMIC is often used in attacks.\n2. Next, notepad.exe sets a registry value. Not sure if that's bad on its own, but maybe part of something else.\n3. cmd.exe also sets registry values multiple times. I know cmd can be used maliciously, especially with command lines like the ones I see later.\n4. Chrome.exe setting registry values—maybe legitimate, but repeated actions could be a red flag.\n5. conhost.exe does similar things as above.\n6. Powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry. Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers for its scripting capabilities.\n7. There's a command line in cmd.exe that copies a file from sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. That looks like it's renaming or replacing system files, which is a classic persistence technique.\n8. More powershell.exe actions, including registry changes.\n9. Another cmd.exe command deleting a scheduled task: schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f. Deleting tasks can hide malicious activities.\n10. schtasks.exe itself is used to delete the same task. Using legitimate tools for malicious purposes is common in attacks.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple instances of process creations and registry modifications by various executables like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and WMIC.exe. The command-line arguments show file copying and deleting scheduled tasks, which could be part of installing or maintaining malware. These actions often indicate malicious behavior because they involve modifying system files and processes, which can help attackers maintain persistence or hide their tracks.\n\nI'm also noticing that the same commands are repeated, like multiple instances of chrome.exe setting registry values and cmd.exe being used for various tasks. This repetition might be part of a script running several steps to achieve a malicious goal.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the batch does show signs of potential malicious activity. The combination of using legitimate tools inappropriately and modifying system files increases the suspicion level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activities, including suspicious file operations, registry modifications, and process creations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events from powershell.exe. Several entries show that Powershell is loading images (clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, etc.). This is normal because Powershell uses these libraries, so alone it might not be suspicious.\n\nThen there are file creation and deletion events for temporary files like __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1. The script creates the file and then deletes it. This could indicate a test or some automated process. However, the fact that the file is deleted shortly after creation might raise an eyebrow, as attackers sometimes clean up traces.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line argument in Powershell: checking if a .bat file exists and exiting if it does. This suggests some conditional execution based on file presence. It's a bit unusual but not necessarily malicious without more context.\n\nThere are multiple registry value set events from chrome.exe. Chrome sometimes modifies the registry for settings, so this might be normal unless there's an unusual pattern or many such events.\n\nAdditionally, there are image load and registry events from Powershell that don't seem immediately suspicious but add to the overall activity.\n\nConsidering all these together, while individual events aren't alarming, the combination of multiple Powershell activities, including file operations and registry changes, could indicate potential malicious behavior. The repeated checks for specific files might be part of a script trying to establish persistence or perform actions based on certain conditions. Therefore, this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events including file creation\/deletion and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are all in JSONL format, with each line containing a JSON object representing an event. Each event has three main fields: process, winlog, and file.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I notice that many of them involve powershell.exe. For example:\n\n- The first event shows powershell.exe loading an image (MpClient.dll). Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this might be a red flag.\n  \n- The second event has powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This seems suspicious because non-interactive startup profiles are usually not accessed when no user is logged in, which could indicate an attempt to persist malware.\n\n- The third and fourth events involve registry value sets by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be a sign of malicious activity trying to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nI also notice multiple instances where powershell.exe accesses processes (ProcessAccess tasks). This could indicate that the script is querying other processes, possibly for information gathering or lateral movement.\n\nAnother point is that several events show process creation for whoami.exe and continued use of powershell.exe with various command lines. The command lines in these events check for the existence of different .bat files. If these files don't exist, the scripts exit with code 0; otherwise, they exit with some other code. This behavior is a bit unusual because it suggests that the script is checking for specific files and possibly reacting based on their presence or absence.\n\nMoreover, there are multiple events where powershell.exe loads different DLLs like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. These could be legitimate if related to .NET Framework, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it might raise concerns about code execution or lateral movement.\n\nThe repeated pattern of process creation with specific command lines for powershell.exe is concerning. It suggests that multiple instances are being spawned, each checking different directories for files. This kind of activity could be part of a larger script trying to execute malicious commands or spread across the system.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the combination of multiple powershell.exe processes accessing various files and registry entries, coupled with repeated checks for specific .bat files, indicates potential malicious behavior.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is powershell.exe with different command lines. Some create new files or set contents in .bat files. That might be a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. The creation of batch files could indicate an attempt to execute commands or set up scripts.\n\nThere's also a series of file operations: creating and deleting temporary files, like the one named __PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1 in the AppData folder. This looks suspicious because it's a PowerShell script being created and then deleted. Attackers sometimes use such techniques to evade detection by leaving minimal traces.\n\nAdditionally, there are registry value sets from both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or for privilege escalation, which are common in attacks.\n\nLooking at the image loads, powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, which is normal but could also be a way to inject malicious code if those DLLs are compromised.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with command-line arguments that create and modify files, combined with registry changes and temporary file operations, suggests possible malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: it's a process creation of powershell.exe with a command line that creates and writes to some .bat files. The task is 'Process Create', which is significant because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. The command seems to be creating new items in specific paths and setting content via Set-Content, which could indicate script generation.\n\nThe second event shows another powershell.exe process accessed with a task of 'ProcessAccess'. This suggests that the same or another instance is accessing something on the system, possibly interacting with files or other resources.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe loads images (DLLs). These include mscoree.dll and related .NET framework components. Such DLLs being loaded might be part of normal PowerShell operation, but could also be a sign of script execution or more malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the fourth to eighth events, each shows ImageLoad tasks for various DLLs in the system32 directory and .NET frameworks. This is standard for many processes, including PowerShell scripts, as they often load these libraries. However, the number of such events might indicate something unusual if too many are loaded at once.\n\nThe ninth event also involves powershell.exe with a command line similar to the first one, creating new .bat files and writing content. The task here is 'Provider Lifecycle', which seems related to file system operations or volume management in Windows. This could be part of legitimate script execution but might also be a way to create persistence points or execute commands on disk.\n\nEvents 10 through 14 follow the same pattern: powershell.exe creating new .bat files and setting their content to 'dir'. Each has a 'Provider Lifecycle' task, which suggests repeated file system operations. The paths being accessed seem structured but might be targeting various parts of the filesystem to write scripts, possibly for persistence or lateral movement.\n\nI notice that each command line is slightly different in terms of file paths, but they all follow a similar structure: creating a new .bat file with New-Item and writing 'dir' as content. Writing 'dir' could just be a way to test permissions or create files, but in bulk like this might indicate something more malicious.\n\nConsidering the volume of events—there are 14 events in total—it's important to see if this level of activity is normal for the system. If these .bat files are being created across different directories, it could be an attempt to spread scripts or create persistence points across the system.\n\nThe use of powershell.exe in multiple events with similar command structures raises suspicion. PowerShell is a common tool for both admins and attackers, but such repetitive actions might indicate automation or script execution as part of malicious activities.\n\nMoreover, the creation of .bat files with 'dir' commands could be harmless (e.g., testing file creation), but when combined with other actions like registry modifications or image loading, it's more concerning. However, in these events, I don't see direct evidence of malicious payload execution beyond script writing.\n\nThe justification for classification would be the repeated use of powershell.exe to create and write to .bat files across different directories, which could be an attempt at persistence or lateral movement within a network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating and writing to .bat files across various directories suggest potential malicious activity such as script generation or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems normal because it's a common tool used to get user information. But sometimes attackers might use it, but on its own, it's not suspicious.\n\nNext, there are several events where PowerShell is accessed or created. I notice multiple entries with command lines checking for specific files and exiting based on their existence. This could be part of legitimate script execution, but the paths mentioned like \"C:\\pacote_principal\\objeto_base\\estrutura_secundario\" look suspiciously structured. They might indicate that the attacker is trying to check if certain files exist as part of a payload deployment or lateral movement.\n\nAdditionally, there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell, which is normal since it's loading necessary DLLs. But combined with the other events, it makes me think that PowerShell is being used in a way that could be malicious. The repeated checks across different directories might suggest an attempt to establish persistence or spread across systems.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with each event, there are Process Create, Process Access, and Registry value sets. These activities can be part of normal operations, but when combined with the command-line arguments that include file existence checks, it raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\n\nThe fact that multiple files are being checked in different locations might indicate that an attacker is verifying if their tools or configurations are present on the system. This could be a sign of reconnaissance or preparation for further attacks.\n\nPutting all these together, while individual events might not look suspicious, the combination suggests possible malicious behavior.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where PowerShell is being executed with a command line that checks if certain .bat files exist and exits accordingly. The paths in these commands seem to be navigating through various directories, but nothing immediately stands out as malicious here. They look like they're testing for file existence, which could be part of normal script execution.\n\nNext, there's an event where a file is created by PowerShell at a temporary path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1. Then, the same process deletes this file shortly after. This behavior is a bit suspicious because creating and immediately deleting a script file might indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies or script execution restrictions.\n\nAnother event shows that PowerShell is loading some DLLs related to Windows Defender. That's normal as PowerShell often loads various components. However, I should keep an eye out for any anomalies here, but nothing seems off in these entries.\n\nThere are also events from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. That's expected behavior for log shipping tools and doesn't raise flags on its own.\n\nLooking at the other events: there's a registry value being set by PowerShell, which is common for scripts that might be configuring settings or installing components. There's also an event where a process was accessed, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, the creation and deletion of a temporary script file by PowerShell stands out. This could indicate an attempt to execute code in a way that leaves minimal traces, which is often a tactic used by malware or attackers. The use of a throwaway script might be part of a larger attack chain, such as downloading additional payloads or performing malicious activities before deleting evidence.\n\nI'm not entirely certain if this activity alone constitutes malicious behavior, but it's enough to raise an eyebrow. The confidence level isn't super high because the individual actions could also be from legitimate scripts trying to test permissions or configurations. However, the combination of creating a script file and then deleting it quickly does lean towards something potentially suspicious.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, I'd classify this batch as interesting due to the temporary script file behavior, but with moderate confidence since there's no concrete evidence of malicious activity yet.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions check for files and create\/deleted a temporary script, indicating potential suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, a lot of these events are from powershell.exe. That's common because PowerShell is often used both for legitimate tasks and by attackers. The first few events show ImageLoad related to MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, which I know are parts of Windows Defender. So that seems normal; maybe it's just Defender updating or running scans.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate event for a .ps1 file in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1. That caught my attention because creating a PowerShell script in Temp could be suspicious, especially if it's deleted right after. The next event is a FileDeleteDetected for that same script, which might indicate an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ProcessCreate events for cmd.exe and whoami.exe. Using these tools isn't inherently bad, but they can be used maliciously. For instance, whoami can check user information, and cmd can execute commands or scripts.\n\nI also notice several RegistryEvent tasks. Modifying the registry is common in attacks to persistence or change system configurations. The fact that powershell.exe is accessing and modifying registry values multiple times could mean an attacker is trying to establish persistence or alter security settings.\n\nAnother point is the repeated EngineLifecycle events for PowerShell. These might indicate scripts being executed, but without context on what those scripts do, it's hard to tell if they're malicious. However, the combination with file creation\/deletion and registry changes raises suspicion.\n\nThe events involving checking for files (Test-Path in command lines) could be part of a script that verifies certain binaries exist before proceeding. If these binaries are malicious, this would be a prelude to an attack.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple powershell processes doing various actions, creation\/deletion of temp scripts, registry modifications, and checks for other files—this batch seems indicative of potentially malicious activity. The repeated attempts and varied actions don't look like normal user behavior but rather someone trying to execute commands stealthily.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of powershell.exe performing actions such as file creation, deletion, registry modifications, and process access.

PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that catches my attention. But I need more context to know if it's bad.\n\nNext, whoami.exe running without any file info. That's not too concerning on its own since it's a common tool for checking user information.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of powershell.exe accessing processes again. Repetitive use might indicate something suspicious, but again, alone it's hard to say.\n\nLooking further, I see several events where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that check if certain files exist in specific paths. For example, the command line has conditions like \"if (Test-Path \\\\\"C:\\\\path\\\\file.cs\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This looks like it's testing whether those files are present on the system.\n\nI'm noticing a pattern where each event checks a different path. The paths mentioned, like C:\\modulo_secundario\\pacote_padrao and others, seem structured but I don't recognize them as standard directories. It feels like someone is trying to verify if certain files or structures exist across various locations, which could be part of malicious activity such as checking for previous infections or dropping malware components only if specific conditions are met.\n\nAlso, these events all come from the same process (powershell.exe) with similar command lines, just different paths. This repetition might be an attempt to check multiple potential infection points without causing immediate harm, perhaps during a lateral movement phase in an attack.\n\nThe tasks logged include ProcessCreate and ImageLoad, which are typical for process creation and loading of libraries, but combined with the specific command-line arguments, it raises suspicion. The use of powershell.exe in such a way is often used by attackers to execute scripts and evade detection.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that there's no associated file information (file: None) except when images are loaded suggests that these might be part of a script checking environment before any actual file operations. This could mean they're probing the system for vulnerabilities or presence of other tools before deploying more malicious actions.\n\nPutting it all together, while each individual event might not be alarming, the combination of multiple powershell.exe processes with these specific command lines across different paths indicates potentially malicious behavior.

Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the first few events, it seems like a lot are related to powershell.exe. The tasks include Image loaded, File created, and File Delete logged. That could be normal admin activity, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious scripts.\n\nI notice that some events have command lines with paths checking if certain files exist. For example, they're testing if \"elemento_base.cs\" exists by using Test-Path. This might indicate someone is trying to see if specific files are present on the system. That's a bit concerning because it could be part of an attack to check for existing malware or to ensure the environment is set up before deploying something malicious.\n\nThere are also events where PowerShell loads DLLs from Windows Defender, which seems okay, but combined with other actions might not be normal. The FileDeleteDetected event stands out because it's a deletion that was logged, possibly indicating an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nAnother point is the creation of temporary files in different user directories like fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. Temporary files can be part of legitimate processes, but creating them and then deleting them might be a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the later events, there's more focus on Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts. That script name suggests it's designed to capture keystrokes, which is definitely something malicious because it could steal sensitive information like passwords or other inputs.\n\nAlso, multiple instances of checking for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 files across various paths might indicate an attempt to ensure that this script can be executed successfully without being blocked. The repeated use of Test-Path in different command lines seems suspicious and possibly part of a larger plan to run malicious code once certain conditions are met.\n\nThe process accesses other processes, which could mean it's trying to interact with running services or extract information, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data theft.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the pattern suggests someone is testing the system's configuration, attempting to create and delete files, possibly exfiltrating data, and planning to execute a script that captures keystrokes. The repeated use of PowerShell with specific command lines targeting various locations across the filesystem increases the suspicion.\n\nWhile some individual actions might look benign, the combination—especially the multiple checks for malicious scripts and the creation\/deletion of temporary files—is a red flag.

The user is a cybersecurity expert looking to analyze a batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. They want me to return a single JSON result with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the events provided. There are multiple entries from different processes like powershell.exe, whoami.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, winlogbeat.exe, chrome.exe, and svchost.exe. Each event has process info, a task from winlog, and sometimes a file path.\n\nPowershell.exe appears several times with tasks like FileCreate, RegistryEvent, ProcessAccess. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated instances could be suspicious. The fact that it's accessing files and registry entries might indicate script execution or persistence mechanisms.\n\nWhoami.exe and Calculator.exe are benign processes but appear multiple times. However, their presence alone doesn't raise red flags unless they're doing something unusual, which they don't seem to here.\n\nNotepad.exe and calc.exe are standard tools; their activities aren't concerning on their own.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe is likely related to log management, so its activity might be normal depending on the system's setup. The file path mentioned seems like a configuration file, which makes sense for such an application.\n\nThe extensive network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe stand out. Chrome making multiple connections could be due to regular browsing, but it's worth noting if these are unexpected or to unusual domains. Svchost.exe is a common system process, but network activity might indicate something more if it's part of known malware.\n\nThe real-time analysis needs to consider the combination of events. The repeated use of powershell.exe with registry and file access suggests potential scripting or persistence. Coupled with svchost.exe's network connections, which are often used by malicious processes to communicate with command servers, this could be a sign of an active threat.\n\nI should assess confidence based on the number of potentially suspicious activities. While each event isn't necessarily bad, the pattern—especially powershell and svchost behaviors—points towards possible malicious intent. However, without more context like exact file paths or domains accessed, it's hard to be 100% certain.\n\nSo, the classification would likely be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75, considering the concerning patterns but acknowledging some uncertainty due to limited contextual data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe accessing files and registry values, which could indicate potential malicious activity. Additionally, repeated network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe may warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event shows a process named powershell.exe with a command line that checks if a specific PowerShell script exists. It exits with 0 if the file is present, else 1. This might indicate an attempt to check if a malicious script is already on the system before proceeding.\n\nThe second event also involves powershell.exe and mentions a Registry value set task. This could mean the script is modifying registry settings, which often has suspicious implications like persistence mechanisms or configuration changes that shouldn't be there.\n\nLooking at the third event, it's another powershell.exe process with a command line similar to the first but pointing to a different path. It seems like multiple attempts are being made to check for the presence of malicious scripts in various locations. This repeated checking is red flags for potential malicious activity trying to ensure they can run without detection.\n\nThere are several more events where powershell.exe accesses processes, loads images, and interacts with files. The file operations, especially creating and then deleting a script (like __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1), suggest that the script might be trying to bypass certain policy checks or is self-deleting after execution to avoid being detected.\n\nAlso, the events show different paths where Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is being checked for existence across multiple locations. This suggests a potential attempt to run this script from various directories, possibly trying different ways to execute it without success, but indicating that the attacker is persistently trying to run it.\n\nAnother point is the involvement of Mscoree.dll and other .NET framework components loaded by powershell.exe, which are typical for running scripts. This could be part of normal operation, but combined with other events might raise concern.\n\nAdditionally, the last event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. While this could be legitimate, considering it alongside all the PowerShell activity might not add much unless there's an unusual association between these processes.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple instances of powershell.exe checking for the presence of malicious scripts across various directories, attempting to create and delete files quickly, along with registry modifications and loading of certain DLLs. These behaviors strongly indicate that the system is under a potential attack where the attacker is trying to execute malicious scripts (possibly keyloggers or other harmful tools) and ensuring they can run without detection by checking their existence first.\n\nTherefore, this batch of events should be classified as INTERESTING because it shows signs of possible malicious activity attempting to execute scripts on the system, including persistence mechanisms and file operations that are indicative of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe checking for malicious scripts across different paths, creating temporary files which are later deleted, and modifying registry settings. These actions suggest potential malicious activity attempting to execute scripts or establish persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a system.\n\nFirst, I notice that there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused for malicious purposes. The fact that it's appearing multiple times in the logs might already raise some flags.\n\nLooking deeper into the events, one of them shows a file being created and then immediately deleted: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1. Creating a script file and then deleting it could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or test if the system allows execution of such scripts.\n\nAnother point is the command lines associated with powershell.exe, which include commands like ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, and gci -recurse. These are all directory listing commands, but when combined, especially with recursive options, they might indicate a broader exploration or data gathering activity on the system.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Image Load events from powershell.exe, including paths like mscoree.dll and others related to .NET framework. This is normal for powershell as it's part of its operation, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nThe process accesses include 'Process Create' and 'Registry value set', which could be part of legitimate operations or could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations, potentially maliciously.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with specific commands, file creation\/deletion, and multiple process events seem like they might be part of a larger script or tool execution. This behavior doesn't fit typical user activity and could be indicative of unauthorized access or malware attempting to establish persistence or gather information.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the combination of powershell activities with file manipulation and directory traversal isn't something I'd expect from normal system usage. The confidence is around 0.85 because while some of these actions aren't outright malicious, their frequency and specific nature suggest potential nefarious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with potentially suspicious command lines and file operations detected, including creation and deletion of a temporary script file.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me go through this step by step. So, I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine whether the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first two events are from PowerShell with command lines that involve 'ls -recurse', which lists files recursively. The task in these cases is related to Provider and Engine Lifecycle. This might be normal activity if someone is running scripts or commands through PowerShell.\n\nNext, there's an event where PowerShell loads the MpClient.dll file. That seems okay because it's part of Windows Defender, so that's a legitimate process.\n\nThen, winlogbeat.exe creates a new configuration file in the user's downloads folder. Winlogbeat is likely a log management tool, and creating config files is standard behavior for such tools.\n\nThe seventh event shows PowerShell setting a registry value. That can be tricky because while it's common for scripts to modify the registry, it could also be malicious if it's changing sensitive settings without permission.\n\nAnother event with conhost.exe modifying the registry stands out. Conhost is often used in command-line interfaces, but any unexpected registry changes here might warrant closer look.\n\nThen there are multiple events where PowerShell creates files, including one named 'estrutura_secundario.txt' in the user's downloads. Creating files during script execution can be normal, but the name seems generic—maybe too generic? Not sure yet.\n\nI also notice that several processes (Powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe) are creating multiple files and making registry changes. While this might not always be bad, it's worth monitoring because attackers often create or modify files to maintain persistence or drop payloads.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands, especially with recursive directory listings and modifying the registry. These actions could indicate script execution, which is common but sometimes used by attackers for lateral movement or data exfiltration. The combination suggests potential malicious activity, but I'm not certain. \n\nI think the batch is somewhat interesting because while individual events might be normal, the pattern—especially multiple processes and system modifications—is a bit concerning. So, my confidence level would be around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands with potential malicious intent, including registry modifications and file creation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
