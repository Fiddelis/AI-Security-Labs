{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events. Let me look through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, I notice that many entries involve powershell.exe, which is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be a red flag for malicious activities. The first few events show powershell loading various DLLs, which is normal in some cases but could indicate malicious activity if the paths seem suspicious.\n\nLooking closer, there are several instances where powershell.exe is executed with \"-exec bypass\". This is a common technique used to run PowerShell scripts without certain execution policies, often by attackers trying to execute malicious code. The command lines have Base64 encoded strings (like SQBuAHY...), which when decoded, would likely be malicious commands.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated download of a script from GitHub using net.webclient. The URL points to a known repository for malicious tools like WinPwn. This suggests an attempt to execute arbitrary code downloaded from the internet, which is highly suspicious.\n\nThere are also events where the task in winlog is 'User Account Management'. These could indicate attempts to modify user accounts or permissions, which might be part of privilege escalation.\n\nThe combination of these factors—use of powershell.exe with execution bypass, downloading scripts from known malicious sources, and system-level changes—strongly suggests a potential attack. The repetitive nature of the commands and events indicates a coordinated attempt rather than isolated incidents.\n\nGiven all this, it's clear that the batch is highly relevant for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines attempting to download and execute code from a known malicious repository. Indicators include use of -exec bypass, repeated downloading of scripts, and system-level changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what I've got here. There are a bunch of events in JSONL format that I need to analyze as a whole. My goal is to determine if this batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nLooking through each event, the first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so its presence could be significant. \n\nThe events show various actions: file creation, registry changes, process accesses, image loads, and even a command line that includes downloading a script from a GitHub repository. That URL seems suspicious—WinPwn.ps1 might be part of known malware or exploit kits. The use of 'iex' (invoke-expression) to execute the downloaded script is a red flag for malicious activity.\n\nThere are also events where files are created and then deleted, which could indicate an attempt to clean up traces after executing some code. Additionally, multiple registry value sets might be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware.\n\nOther processes like 'CompatTelRunner.exe' loading various DLLs don't immediately raise alarms, but the sheer number of PowerShell activities with specific file and registry interactions is concerning. The combination of downloading scripts, executing them, and manipulating files\/registry points towards potential malicious behavior.\n\nI'm also noting that several events involve image loads for DLLs related to .NET and Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. This might be normal, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nPutting all this together, the batch shows a sequence of actions that could indicate a breach or attack, especially with the explicit script download and execution via PowerShell. The confidence level is high because multiple indicators suggest malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe including file creation, registry changes, downloading a script from an external source, and potential cleanup actions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at these JSONL entries one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice that some events have the process command line with powershell.exe executing a script from a GitHub repo. The URL mentioned is associated with S3cur3Th1sSh1t's WinPwn project. I remember hearing that this specific script is known for being malicious; it's used in attacks to steal sensitive information, like credentials and other data on Windows systems.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where the command line is exactly the same across several entries. This repetition suggests that a script or automated process is running the same command multiple times, which might be part of an attack trying different methods or attempting persistence after gaining access.\n\nThen, I see a lot of \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks in the winlog events. These seem to be from other processes, possibly indicating remote execution attempts. Since these are happening many times, it could mean that an attacker is trying various ways to run commands on the system remotely, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there's a process named \"services.exe\" involved in a logon event. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but if it's part of a sequence leading to remote command execution or downloading malicious scripts, that could be concerning.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of the same powershell script being run, which is known to be malicious, along with repeated attempts to execute remote commands. This combination indicates potential unauthorized access and data theft. The consistent repetition points towards coordinated malicious activities rather than isolated incidents.\n\nSo, I think the batch should be classified as INTERESTING because it shows signs of a cyberattack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe executing a known malicious script from a GitHub repository associated with WinPwn, along with numerous 'Execute a Remote Command' events suggesting potential unauthorized access or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a system. My job is to analyze all these events together and decide if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first few events involve processes like powershell.exe and whoami.exe being accessed or created. Powershell is often used in legitimate scripts but can also be a red flag because it has powerful scripting capabilities that attackers might abuse. Seeing multiple instances of powershell.exe, especially with command-line arguments, raises my eyebrows.\n\nLooking at the fourth event, there's a cmd.exe process running with \"\/c powershell -exec bypass -e\" followed by some encoded string. The \"-exec bypass\" part is concerning because it's a common technique to execute PowerShell without certain security restrictions. Also, the encoded string (SQBuAHYAbwBr...) might be Base64 or something similar, which could hide malicious commands.\n\nThe seventh event stands out too; another powershell.exe process with a long command line that includes \"-exec bypass\" and an encoded argument. This repetition suggests a possible attempt to execute code in an elevated context or to bypass security measures, which is a big red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nThen, there's a series of events where powershell.exe loads various DLLs into memory. Legitimate scripts might load these, but the specific paths and multiple instances make me think that this could be part of a larger attack chain, maybe deploying some kind of payload or establishing persistence.\n\nAnother interesting point is the file operations: creating and then deleting a PowerShell script in the Temporary folder (__PSScriptPolicyTest_rtdkaqiv.g0h.ps1). This behavior is suspicious because attackers often create temporary files to store malicious scripts. Deleting them afterward might be an attempt to cover their tracks, but it's also common for legitimate processes to clean up after themselves.\n\nLooking at other events, there's a process creation for notepad.exe and some registry value sets by cmd.exe and wmiprvse.exe. While notepad is benign on its own, if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it could be part of an attack vector.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple powershell processes with elevated privileges, use of Base64 encoded commands, file creation and deletion in temp directories, and registry modifications. These are all hallmarks of potential malicious activity. The combination suggests a possible script execution attempt, which could indicate an attacker trying to execute code on the system.\n\nI'm not seeing any clear indicators that these events are part of normal user activities. Legitimate scripts might run powershell.exe, but the repeated use with suspicious arguments and file operations makes it more likely that this is something malicious or at least worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with elevated privileges and encoded commands, temporary file creation\/deletion, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
