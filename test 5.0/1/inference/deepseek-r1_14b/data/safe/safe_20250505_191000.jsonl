{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the provided batch of events is relevant for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first six events have `process` and `file` as null, but their `winlog` task is \"User Account Management.\" These are likely normal user activity related to account changes or logins, so they don't raise any red flags on their own.\n\nNext, there's an event where Excel.exe loads a system DLL (`coml2.dll`). This seems normal since Excel relies on various system files. Then, two events show Excel making DNS queries. Again, this is typical behavior for applications needing to resolve domain names, especially if they have online components or updates.\n\nThe interesting part comes when Excel creates a file in the Recent folder: `real_values.csv.LNK`. This is a shortcut file pointing to real values. While creating shortcuts can be benign, it's worth noting because malicious actors sometimes create such files as part of their activities. However, without more context indicating suspicious behavior (like multiple attempts, failures, or unusual file names), this might not be alarming.\n\nLooking further, there are three events where the `winlog` task is \"None.\" This could mean either no specific task was logged or that the event didn't trigger any logging, which isn't uncommon and doesn't necessarily indicate malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these events collectively, most of them appear to be normal user activities involving Excel. While creating a shortcut file in the Recent folder could be concerning, it's not enough evidence on its own without additional indicators like repeated failures, unexpected locations, or other anomalies.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there are no clear signs of malicious behavior across the events. However, if more context were available or if there were multiple such shortcut creations without a legitimate reason, the classification might change.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal user activities, including system management tasks and Excel operations with no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. I'm trying to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first few entries are all about `SDXHelper.exe` loading images like `combase.dll` and `urlmon.dll`. These seem like standard system processes accessing known Windows libraries, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen there's an entry where `rundll32.exe` is called with a command line that includes `shell32.dll`. Rundll32 is commonly used to run DLLs, but the GUID mentioned here doesn't ring any bells as malicious. It might be part of a legitimate application or script.\n\nNext up, `svchost.exe` modifying the registry. Svchost is a standard service host process, so it's normal for it to interact with the registry. Unless there's an unusual path or activity, this doesn't seem concerning.\n\nThere are events about creating files related to `winlogbeat.yml.new`. Winlogbeat is an Elasticsearch log shipper, and these entries likely indicate its configuration being written. This is expected behavior and not a red flag.\n\nExcel.exe appears multiple times with various image loads. It's opening a CSV file and loading standard DLLs. While Excel can sometimes be used in attacks, the activities here don't show any malicious intent, just normal operation.\n\nWmiPrvSE.exe is another process that's part of Windows Management Instrumentation. The command line looks legitimate, embedding as usual. Loading `wmiutils.dll` is a standard action for this process, so no issues there.\n\nThere are multiple entries related to user account management and logon events, which are common in system logs as users log in or out, or services start up.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, all these processes and activities are within the realm of normal system operations. There's nothing unusual that would raise a red flag. No signs of unauthorized access, payload execution, or data exfiltration are present.\n\nI should also consider if there's any repeated or excessive activity that might indicate something amiss. However, each event is consistent with typical user actions and system processes running smoothly. The fact that no events are marked as failed or indicate an anomaly further supports that this batch isn't concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system operations, such as process creation, image loading, and file creation related to legitimate processes like Excel.exe, rundll32.exe, and svchost.exe. There are no signs of malicious activities or anomalies in the log entries.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
