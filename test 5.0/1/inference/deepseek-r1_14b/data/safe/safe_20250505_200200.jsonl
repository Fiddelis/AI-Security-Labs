{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe with a task \"Pipe Created.\" PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so that catches my attention. The second event also involves powershell.exe but under the \"Engine Lifecycle\" task, which might just be it starting up normally. \n\nNext, there are two ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. MpClient is related to Windows Defender, which seems normal. Urlmon is part of URL handling in Windows, so that's also benign.\n\nThen, the logs switch to winlogbeat.exe creating a file called .winlogbeat.yml.new. This looks like it's setting up or updating a configuration file for the Logstash shipper, which is standard behavior for log management tools. No red flags here.\n\nLastly, two events from svchost.exe creating files in the XboxLive directory, including AuthStateCache.dat. Svchost.exe is a common system process that can be associated with various services, and these files seem related to user authentication data for Xbox Live services. Again, nothing suspicious on the surface.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are multiple events from powershell.exe which could warrant monitoring, each individual activity seems normal. There's no indication of unusual file accesses, failed logins, or known malicious processes. The only possible area of interest is the use of powershell.exe, but without more context like command-line arguments or deviations from standard usage patterns, it doesn't rise to the level of being clearly suspicious.\n\nTherefore, I'd classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include normal PowerShell activity and legitimate file operations by system processes. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of logs to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. I'll go through each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from different processes: winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe, ssh.exe, Explorer.EXE, etc. Let's break them down:\n\n1. **winlogbeat.exe**: It seems like this process is involved in creating files related to .winlogbeat.yml.new. Since Winlogbeat is a tool used for collecting logs, these file creation events are likely normal and part of its operation.\n\n2. **powershell.exe**: There are several entries here. Some are about image loading (loading DLLs which is standard), others are process access or create events. Notably, there's a command line showing that PowerShell was executed but without any suspicious script mentioned. However, later events show file creation and deletion of __PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1. This temporary file might indicate that a script is being tested or executed, which could be part of normal operations but sometimes scripts can be malicious.\n\n3. **ssh.exe**: There are network connection detections, which could be normal if it's an SSH server connecting. However, the exact context isn't clear, so I'd need to check if these connections are expected.\n\n4. **Explorer.EXE**: A registry value set event. Since Explorer is a core Windows process, this might not be unusual unless it's modifying sensitive areas without reason.\n\n5. **Provider Lifecycle events for PowerShell**: These could relate to the initialization or deinitialization of certain components and likely aren't suspicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows normal operations with tools like Winlogbeat, SSH services, and PowerShell being used. However, the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file raises an eyebrow. Temporary scripts can be legitimate for testing policies but could also indicate malicious activity trying to execute code without persistence.\n\nI'm moderately confident that this batch is interesting because while many events are normal, the script file's lifecycle might warrant closer inspection to ensure it's not part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell activities and a temporary script file creation\/deletion which may indicate potential malicious behavior or testing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
