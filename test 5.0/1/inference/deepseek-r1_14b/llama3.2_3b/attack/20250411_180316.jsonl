These tools are commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that raises a red flag. The command lines don't immediately seem suspicious at first glance, but the frequency is notable.\n\nThere's a pattern of Registry value sets by PowerShell and conhost.exe. That could be part of normal operation, but it might also indicate an attempt to persistence or modify system configurations in a way that's not easily reversible.\n\nI see several file deletions logged, specifically a PowerShell script being deleted. This makes me think: why delete a script? Is it trying to remove evidence or prevent execution? It could be part of cleaning up after malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of \"powershell.exe & {}\" in command lines and events related to provider lifecycle. This looks like it's invoking PowerShell without arguments, but the \"&\" might be an attempt to execute additional commands that aren't logged here. There's also a mention of mscoree.dll and other .NET framework components being loaded, which is common for scripts but could be indicators of malicious code execution.\n\nLooking at the file creations and deletions in user directories like AppData and Downloads, it suggests activity specific to the current user's environment. The script being deleted might have been part of a larger operation that was interrupted or cleaned up after.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the repeated use of high-risk tools, registry modifications, file deletions—this batch shows behavior that could be indicative of malicious activity. However, without more context on whether this is normal for the user's environment, it's hard to be certain. The patterns are concerning enough to warrant closer investigation.\n\nSo, overall, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while individual events might seem benign, their combination raises suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell and cmd.exe execution, registry modifications, and file deletions suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that many events are related to powershell.exe being executed with specific command lines. The commands in the command_line field create new files and set content in batch files. For example, \"New-Item\" creates a file, and \"Set-Content\" writes \"dir\" into another file. This could be suspicious because creating multiple files might indicate an attempt to leave behind scripts or alter the system's behavior.\n\nLooking at the tasks from winlog, there are several types: Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded, Provider Lifecycle, and Engine Lifecycle. The use of Registry writes is a red flag because attackers often modify the registry to persist malicious activities. Also, multiple ImageLoad events loading .NET framework DLLs might be normal but could also suggest that some code is being executed.\n\nI see repeated patterns in the command lines where powershell.exe is used to create and set batch files. The paths mentioned vary, but they all follow a similar structure of creating a script file and setting its content. This repetitive behavior suggests a possible automated process or script execution, which might be malicious if it's attempting to create multiple scripts across different directories.\n\nThe events also involve loading various system DLLs and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which is normal for some operations but could indicate that the PowerShell script is using legitimate modules in an unusual way. The Process Create events show new instances of powershell.exe being spawned, which might be part of a chain of command execution typical in attack chains.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple process creations with specific commands, registry modifications, image loading, and repeated attempts to create batch files—this combination raises concerns about potential malicious activity such as script injection, persistence mechanisms, or file tampering. The confidence level is high because while individual events might not be alarming, the pattern across the entire batch suggests a coordinated effort that could indicate an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes creating and modifying files in different directories with suspicious command lines.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

I'm new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that each line is a JSON object representing an event. There are multiple events here, each with details about the process, Windows log task, and file involved.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n- The RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value.\n- calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which seems normal since it's a system file.\n- powershell.exe accessing something, which is common but could be suspicious if used maliciously.\n- svchost.exe also setting registry values. I know svchost can be legitimate or part of malware.\n\nI notice that there are multiple entries from powershell.exe and cmd.exe. That stands out because these tools can execute commands and are often used in attacks. For example, the command_line field in one cmd.exe event shows \"\/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". This looks like it's trying to delete Notepad.exe processes. Why would someone want to delete system processes? That could be an attempt to cover their tracks or disrupt normal operations.\n\nAnother cmd.exe event copies sethc_backup.exe over sethc.exe, which are system files. Overwriting these might be a way for malware to hide or replace legitimate tools with malicious ones.\n\nThere's also a schtasks.exe event deleting a task. Scheduled tasks can be used by attackers to maintain persistence on a system, so deleting them might indicate an attempt to remove evidence or disable monitoring.\n\nPowershell is being accessed multiple times without clear context. Since it's a powerful tool, repeated access could be for malicious purposes, like script execution or lateral movement in a network.\n\nThe events involving urlmon.dll loaded by both calc.exe and Calculator.exe make me think—malware sometimes uses legitimate processes to load malicious libraries. So this could be an attempt to hide malicious activities within common apps.\n\nOverall, the combination of using powershell, cmd for process deletion and file copying, and modifying system files like sethc.exe makes this batch suspicious. These actions don't seem normal for regular user activity and align with behaviors seen in cyberattacks, such as persistence removal, backdoor creation, or data exfiltration attempts.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these events are definitively malicious, but together they create a concerning pattern that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including process deletions, file replacements, and potential registry modifications using tools like cmd.exe and powershell.exe indicate possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: It's powershell.exe accessing a process, with the task being ProcessAccess. Not too suspicious on its own since PowerShell is commonly used, but I'll keep an eye out for other events related to it.\n\nSecond event: whoami.exe running without any arguments. That seems normal; maybe just checking user information or something similar.\n\nThird to sixth events: These are all powershell.exe processes with command lines that check if certain .bat files exist and exit accordingly. The task is Provider Lifecycle, which usually relates to COM and DLL registration changes. The repeated checks on different script paths might indicate some automated process or perhaps an attempt to verify the presence of specific scripts.\n\nSeventh event: Another PowerShell instance with a similar command line, but this time it's under Process Create. This could be part of a normal startup routine, but multiple instances could hint at something more.\n\nEighth event: Powershell.exe loading mscoreei.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll. These are standard .NET libraries, so nothing unusual here; expected during script execution.\n\nNinth and tenth events: PowerShell creating temporary files in the user's directory. The first one is a PS script test file, which could be part of policy checks or script validation. The second is a text file download, which might not be suspicious on its own but combined with other actions could raise flags.\n\nEleventh event: The temporary PS script being deleted after creation. This could mean the script was executed and then cleaned up, which is common in malicious activities to avoid detection.\n\nTwelfth and thirteenth events: Chrome.exe modifying registry values. Could be legitimate updates or tracking, but if these changes are unusual or multiple, they might warrant attention.\n\nFourteenth event: Powershell.exe creating a pipe, which is typical for inter-process communication. Not suspicious by itself unless used in conjunction with other malicious activities.\n\nFifteenth event: Loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which is expected and not concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell to check multiple script paths and create\/deleted temporary files stands out. This behavior could indicate a script attempting to run only if certain conditions are met, possibly trying to execute different payloads based on availability. The deletion of the test script after creation suggests an attempt to hide traces. While some activities might be legitimate, the combination points towards potential malicious intent, like testing for persistence mechanisms or dropping malware components.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes checking for specific files and creating\/deleting temporary scripts suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

They all seem to involve powershell.exe being executed with some command lines that check if certain files exist and then exit based on the result.\n\nHmm, each command is checking a different path for a .bat file or an executable. The fact that they're exiting 0 or 1 suggests it's part of some conditional logic, maybe trying to determine whether a specific script or component exists before proceeding.\n\nI also notice there are events where files are being created and then deleted shortly after. Like the PSScriptPolicyTest files in different temp directories. This could be an attempt to test for certain policies or to bypass them by creating and deleting temporary scripts quickly.\n\nThe use of Powershell is common in both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so I can't be sure yet if this is benign or not. But the repetitive pattern of checking various paths with similar command structures raises a red flag. It might indicate some form of file presence testing across multiple directories, possibly as part of reconnaissance or trying to execute code conditionally.\n\nThe events also involve different registry operations and process accesses, which are common during script execution. However, the combination of multiple such checks and the creation\/deletion of temporary files could be indicative of attempting to run unauthorized scripts that might be blocked by policies.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while individual events might seem normal, together they show a pattern that's potentially suspicious.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of events from various processes and trying to see if there's any malicious behavior here.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it has so many capabilities, but it can also be legitimate. The commands in the command line look like they're checking for the existence of specific .ps1 files. For example, lines 4 and 5 have command lines testing if \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" exists in different paths. That script name sounds suspicious—keystroke logging is a common malicious activity. However, without seeing the actual content of the file, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThen there are multiple instances where whoami.exe is being run. Whoami is usually harmless and just shows user information, but repeated use could be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance. But again, not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nLooking at other processes like notepad.exe accessing the registry (line 7) seems normal because many applications interact with the registry. Similarly, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll isn't unusual; those are standard system files.\n\nI also see network connections from svchost.exe and chrome.exe. Svchost is a legitimate Windows process, but sometimes malware can hide under it. However, without additional indicators like unusual ports or domains, it's hard to flag this as malicious.\n\nThe file operations include creating and deleting temporary PowerShell scripts. This could be part of an attempt to execute code temporarily or delete evidence after execution. The repeated creation and deletion might suggest something is being tested or run stealthily.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of multiple PowerShell instances checking for specific script files that might be malicious, along with other activities like registry modifications and process access, makes me lean towards classifying this as interesting. While some events are benign, the combination suggests potential malicious activity, but I'm not entirely certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe performing file operations and process access, along with suspicious script checks, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe creating a file in the Temp directory. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell scripts can be malicious, especially when they're created temporarily. Then, the next event has powershell.exe deleting that same file. So it creates and deletes it quickly—that might be an attempt to hide something or just testing if the script exists.\n\nLooking at the third event, there's another powershell.exe command line checking for a specific .cs file and exiting based on its presence. This seems like some sort of file integrity check. But why would it do that? Maybe it's part of legitimate software setup, but could also be malicious code verifying if certain files are present before executing something else.\n\nThe fourth event is powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which is normal since defender uses PowerShell for some tasks. Not too suspicious there.\n\nThen, several events show process access and engine lifecycle events related to powershell.exe. These can be benign as part of script execution or could be indicators of malicious activity like lateral movement.\n\nThe next few events stand out because they're checking for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across various paths. This script is known for capturing keystrokes, which is a common tactic in malware to steal sensitive information. The repeated checks in different locations might mean the attacker is trying to ensure their malicious script exists or is being copied.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe was executed. That could be used by attackers to check user privileges, so that adds more concern.\n\nLooking at all these together: multiple instances of powershell.exe, file creation and deletion, repeated checks for a known malicious script, and privilege checking—it feels like there's some malicious activity going on. The combination suggests an attacker might be trying to execute or distribute malware, possibly using PowerShell for command execution and persistence.\n\nHowever, it's possible that these could also be legitimate activities, especially since the file checks don't always mean the script is running. But considering the repeated attempts and the nature of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a known bad script, I'm leaning towards this being suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe events including file creation\/deletion, repeated checks for malicious scripts, and privilege checks suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

So I'm looking at a series of events from what seems like system logs, probably Windows event logs given the paths and executables mentioned.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so its presence alone doesn't mean anything bad, but repeated usage could be suspicious. Looking closer, each of these powershell.exe processes has command lines with if statements checking for the existence of specific files. For example, \"if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\registro_principal\\\\registro_temporario\\\\registro_secundario\\\\bin\\\\componente_secundario.exe\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This seems like a script that's testing whether certain files exist on the system.\n\nThe fact that multiple powershell commands are checking different paths and files across various directories is notable. It could indicate someone is trying to verify if specific files are present, possibly as part of an installation routine or checking for previous malware components. However, it might also be a way to ensure malicious payloads are in place, which would make this behavior more concerning.\n\nAdditionally, there are other processes like whoami.exe and cmd.exe being executed. Whoami is usually used to get user information, which could help determine privileges or the current context. The cmd.exe runs a command that exits based on whether a file exists in the temp directory. This might be part of a setup routine for something else, or it could be a way to check if certain files are present before executing further commands.\n\nI also see events where powershell is accessing images and loading them, like mscoree.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll. These are legitimate .NET framework components, so that in itself isn't suspicious. But combined with the file checks, it could be part of a larger script's setup.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe across multiple events is a red flag because attackers often use this tool for command execution and persistence. The fact that each command is checking different files suggests a possible file integrity check or ensuring all necessary components are in place, which is something attackers might do before deploying additional malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the tasks in winlog, there are references to 'Engine Lifecycle', 'Registry value set', 'Process Create', 'Process accessed', and 'Image loaded'. Registry modifications can be problematic if they're setting values that enable persistence or change system configurations. The process creations of whoami.exe and cmd.exe could be part of a larger script's execution flow.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple powershell instances checking various files, along with other processes that might be part of an initial access or setup routine, makes this batch of logs interesting. It's possible that an attacker is verifying the presence of certain files as part of their malicious activities, which could indicate a potential security incident.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if these are all legitimate checks by system scripts or actual malicious behavior, but the pattern seems concerning enough to warrant further investigation. The confidence level isn't super high because sometimes powershell can be used for benign purposes, but given the repeated and varied file checks across different directories, it's more likely than not that this is suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with command lines checking various files, along with other process creations like whoami.exe and cmd.exe, suggest potential malicious activity or file integrity checks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries with powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used in malicious activities. The events show the process name as powershell.exe and some command lines that include ls -recurse, get-childitem, etc., which are cmdlets for listing items recursively. This could be part of enumerating systems, which is common in early stages of an attack.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are Image loaded events, which suggests PowerShell is loading certain modules or assemblies. The files involved are system-related like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are legitimate but might indicate that malicious scripts are trying to use them as part of their execution. There's also a File created event for a StartupProfileData file in the user's AppData folder. This could mean the script is creating a profile or configuration file for persistence.\n\nAnother point is the Registry value set event in PowerShell, which often points to changes made on the system, possibly for maintaining access or altering configurations. Malware might use registry keys to ensure it runs at startup.\n\nAdditionally, there's an entry from winlogbeat.exe. It seems normal since it's a log shipping tool, but I should check if it's part of any malicious activity, though in this case, it's probably just setting up its configuration file.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell executions with commands that could gather system info, loading modules, creating files in user directories, and modifying the registry. These behaviors are indicative of potential malicious activity.
