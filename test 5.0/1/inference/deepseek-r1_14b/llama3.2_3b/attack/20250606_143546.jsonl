All the events are in JSONL format, and each line represents a separate event.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events involve 'svchost.exe'. This is a common Windows process that can be tricky because it's legitimate but often used by malware to hide their activities. The tasks include file creation, image loading, and registry value setting. For example, multiple entries show files being created in various directories like 'SoftwareDistribution' and 'DataStore'. These paths are usually associated with Windows Update or other system processes, so I'm a bit cautious here.\n\nThen there's an event where 'MpSigStub.exe' creates several files in the Temp directory. This process is related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus, so seeing it create files isn't unusual on its own. However, if these files are part of an update or signature download, it could be normal. But I should check if the file names and paths seem suspicious.\n\nLooking at the file paths, most seem legitimate, like 'ReserveManager.dll' and 'WinREAgent.dll', which are known to be part of Windows system components. The repeated creation of files with similar naming conventions in 'SoftwareDistribution' makes me think this could be part of a normal update process or possibly something more nefarious.\n\nThe registry value sets by 'svchost.exe' might be concerning because they can indicate malicious activity such as creating persistence mechanisms. However, without knowing exactly what's being set, it's hard to tell if it's harmful.\n\nThere are also some file creation events in the Windows Logs directory, which could be part of system logging processes or something else entirely.\n\nConsidering all these points, I'm leaning towards this batch being 'NOT INTERESTING'. The activities seem consistent with normal system operations, especially since they involve known processes and standard tasks like file creation and registry modifications. While 'svchost.exe' can be malicious, the specific actions here don't raise red flags beyond what's typical.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely certain because sometimes attackers use legitimate processes for malicious purposes. But without more context or signs of abnormal behavior (like unusual timestamps, multiple failed attempts, or unexpected file hashes), it's safer to classify this as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve normal system processes such as svchost.exe performing standard operations like file creation and registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe accessing something with ProcessAccess. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. Next, whoami.exe runs without any command line arguments—seems normal since it's often used to check user information.\n\nThe third event catches my eye. Powershell.exe is being executed with a command line that includes importing a PowerShell script from a path like \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The use of escaped characters and the specific path structure might indicate the script is trying to hide its origin or access restricted files. Also, there's an attempt to run Invoke-entrada_principal, which isn't a standard PowerShell command, so that's suspicious.\n\nThen, powershell.exe accesses mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are legitimate .NET libraries. That doesn't seem too bad on its own. However, the next event shows powershell.exe accessing System.Management.Automation.ni.dll—again, part of normal operation but could be used maliciously.\n\nA file deletion event for a PowerShell script in the Temp directory is concerning. Malicious scripts often delete themselves to avoid detection. The pipe created by powershell.exe might indicate communication with another process, possibly for command and control.\n\nLooking at sppsvc.exe creating a file in cache.dat—it's part of Windows Update, so that seems normal unless it's being used abnormally here. Then, svchost.exe creates multiple files in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory. Svchost is a legitimate process but often exploited by malware for persistence or attacks.\n\nThe repeated FileCreate events from svchost.exe with various DLLs could be part of normal Windows updates, but the naming (UpdateAgent.dll, Mitigation.dll) might also hint at malicious activities trying to inject code or alter system behavior. The fact that multiple files are being created in a short time might indicate some form of bulk file creation, which isn't typical.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe executing an external script, attempting to delete the script after execution, and svchost.exe creating several files could be signs of malicious activity. The use of non-standard PowerShell commands and unusual file operations suggest potential threats like script-based attacks or persistence mechanisms. I'm confident this batch shows behavior that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious activities such as powershell.exe executing an external script, deleting files, and svchost.exe creating multiple files in a potentially malicious manner.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see several entries where the process is \"setup.exe\" creating files. That seems normal because setup.exe is often used for software installations. They're creating two files related to EdgeCore, which sounds legitimate.\n\nThen there are a bunch of events from powershell.exe. Powershell can be tricky because it's a powerful tool that can be used both for good and bad purposes. I notice the first event where PowerShell accesses something, then creates a new service using New-Service. That part stands out to me because creating services is a common tactic in malware to maintain persistence.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .NET DLLs. While that's normal for scripts, the fact that they're being loaded together with creating a service might be suspicious.\n\nThen I see a file being created and immediately deleted by powershell.exe. The path is in the user's Temp folder, which is common for temporary files, but deleting it right after creation could indicate an attempt to hide something or clean up evidence.\n\nNext, there are events where the process information is None, but tasks like \"Execute a Remote Command\" are logged. This suggests that some remote execution might be happening, possibly overwriting the process name to avoid detection (common tactic in malware). The file paths mentioned here point to .ps1 scripts on a mapped drive or shared folder (\"C:\\\\unidade_logico...\"), which could mean they're executing scripts from an external location, perhaps not native to the system.\n\nThe last few events show powershell.exe commands importing modules and invoking some function \"Invoke-entrada_principal\". The command lines are identical, so this is repeated behavior. Importing modules and invoking functions is how PowerShell scripts work, but the specific naming (\"componente_auxiliar.ps1\") doesn't ring any bells as a legitimate script I know of. It sounds Spanish, which might not be relevant, but the fact that it's being executed multiple times and in a remote context could be concerning.\n\nPutting it all together: setup.exe installing files is likely benign, but the powershell.exe activity raises red flags. Creating services, loading DLLs, temporary file operations, executing remote commands, and repeated script execution from an external path are all signs that might indicate malicious behavior. The combination of these events makes me think this batch could be part of a cyberattack or malware activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell activities, including creating services and executing scripts from external paths, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I've got a batch of events in JSONL format that I need to analyze as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at each event individually and then see how they fit together. The first few events show powershell.exe being executed with specific command lines. The commands import a PowerShell script from \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\registro_secundario\\Componente_Auxiliar.ps1\" and then call Invoke-entrada_principal with the OutputDirectory set to %Temp%. There's also error handling, which is somewhat standard but could be malicious if the function isn't legitimate.\n\nNext, some events show the creation of a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" using New-Service, setting its binary path to \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\", and then starting it. The fact that multiple instances are created with the same parameters raises suspicion because attackers often create multiple services or processes to hide their activities.\n\nThen, there's a series of events where the winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" pointing to the same script path. This suggests repeated attempts to execute remote commands from the same file, which could indicate an ongoing attempt to run malicious code. Additionally, some process events have 'process' set to None, which might mean they're not capturing the process information correctly or that the command is executed in a way that doesn't create a new process, possibly using a technique like RunDLL or other methods to evade detection.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a pattern of repeated attempts to execute powershell scripts and service creations. The combination of multiple events with similar commands and remote execution tasks points towards potential malicious activity. The use of powershell for scripting is common in attacks because it's legitimate but can be weaponized. Also, the creation of services suggests an attempt to persist on the system beyond a single session.\n\nI'm concerned about the repeated attempts and the specific paths used. The script path includes \"..\\registro_secundario\", which might be attempting to access files outside the intended directory, possibly accessing restricted areas or data. This could indicate file traversal vulnerabilities being exploited.\n\nMoreover, the fact that multiple events show similar commands but with different winlog tasks (Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle) suggests a process of loading and executing components in phases, which is a technique often used by attackers to obfuscate their activities and make detection harder.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows signs of suspicious activity. The repeated execution attempts, creation of services, and use of powershell for potentially malicious scripting are red flags. There's enough here that could indicate an attack or at least malicious intent, making this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple attempts to execute PowerShell scripts and create services, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given batch of system logs to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me start by understanding each event.\n\nEach line is a JSON object representing an event. The keys are \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". \n\nLooking at the first few events:\n- process: None\n- winlog: {'task': 'Execute a Remote Command'}\n- file: {'path': 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'}\n\nI notice that all these events have the same structure. The task is consistently \"Execute a Remote Command\", and the file path points to the same .ps1 script.\n\nI check the entire batch and count 14 such events, with one exception where winlog's task is 'None' and file is null.\n\nNow, I need to think about what this means. Repeated attempts to execute the same remote command on a specific script might indicate malicious activity, especially if done multiple times in quick succession.\n\nHowever, since all the events are identical except for one outlier, it could also be legitimate, like a script being run multiple times for a task. But the frequency and repetition make it suspicious.\n\nI'm considering confidence levels. While there's a pattern suggesting potential malware, without more context (like timestamps or other logs), it's hard to be certain. So I'd rate the confidence as moderate.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch contains multiple identical events where a remote command is executed on the same file path, which could indicate malicious behavior.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events indicating repeated execution of a remote command on the same script path.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the JSONL data, each line has three keys: process, winlog, and file. Most of them have \"process\" set to None, which probably means there wasn't a specific process associated with these events. The \"winlog\" field seems to be a task from Windows logs. \n\nI notice that a lot of the entries have the task as \"Execute a Remote Command\". Specifically, I count about 23 instances where this exact same event is logged. That's a significant number. Then there are two other events: one with \"Security Group Management\" and another with \"Logon\", both under different tasks.\n\nNow, thinking about what these might mean. \"Execute a Remote Command\" sounds like something that could be legitimate or malicious. If it's the same command being executed multiple times in quick succession, maybe there's some automation or a script running. The file path mentioned is C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1, which translates to something like \"secondary logical unit\" and \"auxiliary component\". That sounds suspicious because I'm not sure why that specific script would be repeatedly executed.\n\nAlso, considering that all these events have the same file path, it makes me think this could be part of a larger campaign. The repetition might indicate that an attacker is trying to run malicious scripts multiple times, perhaps attempting persistence or lateral movement within the network.\n\nThe two other events are less concerning on their own: \"Security Group Management\" and \"Logon\". These can be normal administrative tasks, so they don't raise as many flags unless combined with other suspicious activities. However, in this batch, it's the overwhelming number of remote command executions that stands out.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated execution of a remote command on the same script path suggests potential malicious activity. It's unusual to see such repetitive behavior unless there's an automated process or exploitation happening. Therefore, this batch seems relevant for further investigation because it could indicate an ongoing attack or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple repeated events of 'Execute a Remote Command' targeting the same file path, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
