All of them are JSON objects and each line represents a separate event. The first thing I notice is that the process name in every event is \"git.exe\". That tells me it's likely related to Git operations, which makes sense for someone working with version control systems.\n\nLooking deeper into the 'winlog' field, all events mention \"File created\" with the rule \"FileCreate\". So each of these is a notification that a file was created. The files being created are located in various paths under different node_modules directories, like set-function-length and side-channel, among others. These look like typical modules used in Node.js projects.\n\nI see that each event specifies a unique file path, and all these files seem to be part of the project's structure—things like package.json, license files, .eslintrc, etc. Since they're node_modules, it suggests this is during a npm install or similar process where dependencies are being set up.\n\nGiven that git.exe is involved in creating files within a Node.js project's directory structure, this looks like a standard part of the development workflow. No unusual processes or access to sensitive areas are evident here. It doesn't raise any red flags related to security incidents or suspicious activities. \n\nSo putting it all together, these events don't indicate anything out of the ordinary for someone developing software using Git and Node.js.

Each event is a JSON object with some information about processes and file creations on a Windows system. The first thing that jumps out at me is the consistency across all these events. They all mention \"git.exe\" as the process name and describe a task related to creating files, specifically under the same path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software.\n\nLooking closer, each file being created is part of different node_modules directories, like semver, serialize-javascript, set-blocking, etc. These are all npm packages, which makes sense because Git can be used for version control in a Node.js project environment. The files include everything from JavaScript modules to package.json files and documentation like READMEs.\n\nI'm wondering if this is part of someone setting up or updating a development environment. Node_modules folders are standard when you install dependencies using npm. So, the process of creating these files could be during an 'npm install' command, which clones these packages into the node_modules directory.\n\nSince all events point to normal file creation activities by a legitimate tool like Git in a software development context, there's no immediate sign of malicious behavior here. There's nothing unusual about git.exe creating files in a user's downloads directory that's part of their project structure.\n\nI'm also considering whether this could be related to any suspicious activity, such as a file injection or unauthorized access. But given the consistent and expected nature of these events—installing Node.js packages—it doesn't raise red flags. There's no evidence of files being deleted, modified in unexpected ways, or accessed by unknown processes.\n\nTherefore, I don't see any reason to classify this batch as interesting from a security perspective. It looks like standard development operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities related to Node.js package installations using Git.exe, which is typical in a development environment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format, and there are multiple entries here. My task is to determine whether this entire batch should be classified as \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING.\" \n\nLooking at the events, they all seem pretty similar. Each line starts with a process named \"git.exe,\" indicating that Git is being used. The event type is a file creation under Windows, specifically triggered by the FileCreate rule. The paths are all within the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\semver.\n\nI know that \"git.exe\" is commonly used for version control, and when you clone a repository or perform operations like fetching updates, Git may create files in directories such as node_modules. The semver package is related to semantic versioning, which is often used in JavaScript projects managed by npm. So, the creation of these files could be part of installing dependencies during development.\n\nEach event lists different file paths under the semver module—classes, functions, internal, etc. This suggests that Git is cloning or updating a repository and creating those specific files. Since all these events are related to a single process and happen within the same directory structure, it's likely that this is part of a normal software development workflow.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no indication of unusual file creation times, access to sensitive areas outside the project directory, or multiple processes involved beyond Git. The consistent naming and location make me think this is routine behavior for someone working on a Node.js project.\n\nTherefore, while each individual event might be worth noting in some contexts, together they don't raise any red flags. They seem entirely legitimate and part of standard development activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Git creating files within a node_modules directory during normal software development activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows Microsoft Edge creating a file named setup.exe in a temporary directory. That seems normal since Edge updates often create and extract files during installation.\n\nNext, CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll isn't unusual; it's part of the Windows Anti-Malware Scan Interface, so that's a standard process.\n\nThe third event is Microsoft Edge again changing the file creation time for setup.exe. File metadata changes can be common during updates or installations, so I'm not raising an eyebrow here.\n\nThen there are multiple User Account Management events. These are typically logged when user accounts are created, modified, or deleted. Without any anomalies in these entries, they don't seem suspicious on their own.\n\nThe Special Logon event is also standard and usually related to service account logins or system processes.\n\nA new file being created for WindowsUpdate logs (WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.13.etl) is expected as part of normal update activities.\n\nTaskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll makes sense since Task Scheduler uses this DLL, and it's a legitimate process.\n\nThe next event catches my attention: powershell.exe being executed with some command-line arguments. The script checks for .inf files in the Windows INF directory and looks for specific patterns. This could be part of normal system operations or updates, but I need to consider if this is trying to detect something malicious. Since it's using Get-Item and Get-Content on known system files, it might be a benign check, but PowerShell scripts can also be used in attacks.\n\nAnother taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll event follows—nothing unusual here.\n\nPowershell.exe creates a file related to the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. This is a bit concerning because creating such a profile could indicate persistence mechanisms or malicious scripts trying to run at startup, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nSvchost.exe creating files under NetworkService's AppData directory for DeliveryOptimization seems normal as it relates to Windows Update and content delivery.\n\nThe creation of an .exe file by MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe in the Download folder is expected during Edge updates. It might be a new version being downloaded, which isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nLastly, there's an event with no task or file, so I'll ignore that as incomplete data.\n\nPutting it all together: most events are normal system activities. The powershell.exe command and the subsequent profile creation stand out but could be part of legitimate processes. However, without evidence of other malicious indicators like failed access attempts, unusual network traffic, or known bad file hashes, there's not enough to conclude a breach. Therefore, I classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activities such as process creations, file operations, and user account management, without any signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The fact that all these events are related to the same module and process makes me think this is normal activity.\n\nThere's nothing unusual about the file paths provided. They seem to be standard components of a Node.js package called sshpk, which is used for cryptographic functions. Since there's no indication of any failed attempts, access from unknown sources, or deviations from expected behavior, I don't see signs of malicious activity here.\n\nThe consistent and repetitive nature of these events also points towards legitimate file creation during the setup or update process of a development environment.

The files being created are inside a node_modules folder, which suggests this might be part of a Node.js project setup or during a Git operation like cloning a repository.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're creating various .js, .d.ts, package.json, readme.md, and license files. These are typical files you'd expect to see in a standard Node.js module structure. For example, index.d.ts and index.js are common for TypeScript definitions and JavaScript files respectively. The presence of package.json indicates that these might be npm packages being installed or created.\n\nThe task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means the system logged each file creation event. Since all events are from the same process and target a known project structure, it doesn't seem suspicious. There's no indication of unusual file paths, access times, or multiple failed attempts that might hint at malicious activity.\n\nI'm considering if this could be part of an attack where attackers create files to hide malware. However, the files here are typical for a Node.js setup, and git.exe is a legitimate process. The volume of events is also within normal ranges for such operations—installing dependencies or setting up a project.\n\nAnother angle: could these file creations be signs of something more? Maybe during an attack, attackers sometimes create multiple files quickly. But given that this looks like standard npm modules being set up, it's likely just regular development activity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the events don't raise any red flags.
