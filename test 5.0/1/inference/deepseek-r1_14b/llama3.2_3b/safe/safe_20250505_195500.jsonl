Each event is a file creation task, which is common for applications updating or accessing their resources.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to locations within the user's AppData directory under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The filenames are JavaScript files with varying hashes in their names, which suggests they might be different versions or parts of some offline content. This pattern doesn't immediately raise any red flags since it's typical for applications to manage multiple resource files.\n\nThere's also an entry where the process is null, and the task is \"Security Group Management\" without a file path. This could be part of routine system maintenance or user activity related to group policies, which isn't unusual.\n\nI check if there are any signs of malicious activities such as repeated failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or deviations from normal behavior.

I'm looking at the JSONL data provided. Each line represents an event where a file was created by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". All these events are similar; they all have the same process name and task description.\n\nThe files being created are JavaScript files located in various subdirectories under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...\\\". The file paths end with different filenames, but they all follow a pattern like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" with varying hexadecimal or other suffixes.\n\nFirst, I should consider what SDXHelper.exe is. A quick check tells me that it's associated with Microsoft Office, specifically used for managing add-ins and solution packages. So, this process is legitimate and part of normal Office operations.\n\nLooking at the file creation events: each event creates a different JavaScript file in an OfflineFiles directory within the SolutionPackages folder. This seems related to Office's setup, possibly caching or storing resources locally. Since these are part of the Office package resources, it's expected that multiple files would be created during this process.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The consistent process name and predictable file paths indicate standard operations. There's no variation in the process name or unusual file destinations. Each event is isolated to a specific file, which aligns with how Office might handle different resources or updates.\n\nThe fact that multiple files are being created doesn't raise a red flag on its own. It's common for legitimate processes to create several files, especially when dealing with packages and updates. The uniformity in the events suggests they're part of a normal cycle rather than something suspicious like bulk file creation by malware.\n\nAdditionally, the paths don't point to system directories or areas where malicious activities typically occur. They're all within user-specific AppData folders, which is standard for application-related files.\n\nIn summary, these events appear to be part of Microsoft Office's regular operation, specifically handling its add-ins and solution packages.

Both seem legitimate—Chrome is a common browser, and SDXHelper might be related to Microsoft Office or some solution package. So, on the surface, these don't raise immediate red flags.\n\nLooking at the tasks performed: there's Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, and File stream created. For each event, I check if the actions align with typical user activities. Image loading for Chrome is normal when opening new tabs or extensions. Registry writes can be part of legitimate software operations, especially during updates or installations.\n\nThe files mentioned are either in standard directories like System32 or under user-specific folders such as AppData and Downloads. The file paths don't seem suspicious at first glance—Chrome handling downloads, Office packages managing resources. I also note the repeated creation of JavaScript files with long hashes; this could be related to caching or resource management by Office applications.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the number of identical file paths created by SDXHelper.exe. Repeated writes might indicate something unusual, but without context on what's normal for that process, it's hard to say. However, since all events are from known processes and involve standard operations like loading images and creating files, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm about 0.8 sure this isn't suspicious because the actions align with legitimate user behavior.

The user is asking me to determine if this batch is relevant for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are from processes like SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. There are multiple entries where the same file paths are being created by SDXHelper.exe. This seems repetitive—like maybe it's part of a normal update or installation process for Office features.\n\nThen there are some events from chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a known Windows system file, so that's probably just standard operation. The EXCEL.EXE processes opening files and loading various DLLs also look routine; Excel often needs to load different modules when running.\n\nThere's one event where svchost.exe set a registry value. SvcHost is a common process for services, but setting registry values isn't necessarily suspicious unless it's an unusual location or happening too frequently. Here, there's no indication of anything wrong—the task is generic.\n\nAnother event has User Account Management without any file info, which could be normal user logon\/logoff activities. The \"None\" task might indicate a system-level change that's not tied to a specific action.\n\nLooking at the files being created by SDXHelper.exe, they all have paths like \"...\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\\" and filenames with hashes or version strings. These look like resource files for Office add-ins or language packs, which are typically part of legitimate updates or installations.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. No unexpected processes, no writes to unusual locations, nothing indicating privilege escalation or data exfiltration.

The file paths mentioned look like temporary files for Excel, so that doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nSDXHelper.exe is also creating several files. These paths seem related to Office packages and their resources.

So, SDXHelper.exe is creating files. The files are located in a path under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office...\", which points to user-specific data or application settings. That makes sense because applications often create temporary or configuration files here.\n\nThe file paths all follow the same pattern: they're inside the \"OfflineFiles\" folder, and each has a unique filename with extensions like .js. These seem to be JavaScript files, possibly part of some web-based resources or scripts used by an application. The naming conventions look consistent, with different hash-like strings appended to each filename.\n\nNow, considering the combination of all these events: they're all file creation actions by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory. Since it's creating multiple JavaScript files with varying hashes, this could be part of a legitimate process, like an application downloading or caching resources for offline use. Microsoft Office applications sometimes package such files for features like offline access or cached content.\n\nHowever, the fact that there are so many identical events might raise some flags. If SDXHelper.exe is creating numerous files quickly, it could indicate something suspicious, like a file injection attack or malicious script generation. But without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nAnother angle is the frequency and volume of these file creations. If this activity is happening within a short time frame, especially if it's unusual for SDXHelper.exe, it might be worth investigating further. Alternatively, it could just be normal behavior depending on how the application operates.\n\nI also notice that some files are created multiple times (like the ones with duplicated hashes), which might suggest retries or redundant operations. This could be part of a normal process flow, but it's something to consider in terms of potential errors or anomalies.\n\nPutting this all together, while there's no clear sign of malicious activity here, the repetitive nature and volume of file creations are interesting enough to warrant attention.

I think it's related to Microsoft Office. Maybe it's part of the Office setup or some package management. The file paths are under \"AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\", which is a common place for Office-related data and extensions.\n\nLooking at the file names, they have \"_ui-strings-json\" in them. That makes me think these are string resources for the user interface, probably part of language packs or localization files. The paths also include different language codes like \"en-us\", \"es-es\", etc., which supports that idea. These seem to be legitimate Office package resources being created.\n\nI notice that some file paths repeat, like two entries for \"hy-am-ui-strings-json...\" and others.

So, each event is a JSON object with three main parts: process info, Windows log details, and file info.\n\nFirst off, the process name in all these events is \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's consistent across every line, so that's something to note. I don't recognize that right away, but it might be a legitimate system process or part of an application.\n\nLooking at the Windows log task, each one says \"File created\" with a specific rule. That means the event is about a file being created, which is a common activity in systems for various reasons—like installing software, updating configurations, etc.\n\nThe file paths are all under the same user's AppData Local folder within Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The package GUIDs vary slightly, but they're all under \"PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\\" with different language-specific JSON files. These seem to be string resource files for different languages—like en-us, es-es, etc.\n\nI'm thinking about whether creating multiple files in this manner is normal. Since these are localized strings, it makes sense that an application would create or update these when initializing, especially if the system supports multiple languages. Microsoft Office often has such language packs, so maybe SDXHelper.exe is part of that setup.\n\nNow, considering malicious activities: things like repeated writes to unexpected locations, attempts to write executables, or writes from unknown processes are red flags. But here, all events are consistent, writing expected resource files in a standard location for an application process.\n\nI also notice some duplication—like two entries for \"es-es-ui-strings-json\" and others. That might be redundant writes, but not necessarily malicious unless it's part of a loop or persistence mechanism, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nAnother point is that all events come from the same process name and user account.

That's interesting because it suggests all these activities are originating from the same source.\n\nThe task field in each event indicates that a file was created, which aligns with the rule \"FileCreate\". So, we're dealing with multiple file creation events. The files being created are located in a path under the user's AppData folder, specifically within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to different language-specific strings JSON files. For example, there are entries like \"lt-lt-ui-strings-json\" and \"nb-no-ui-strings-json\", which correspond to Lithuanian and Norwegian languages respectively. This pattern suggests that these files are likely part of a localization package for an application, probably Microsoft Office, as the path includes \"Microsoft Office\".\n\nNow, considering the fact that all events are from the same process and involve creating multiple localized string files, my initial thought is whether this activity is normal or if it could indicate something malicious. Typically, applications do need to create such files during installation or updates, especially for supporting multiple languages. So, in many cases, this would be benign.\n\nHowever, since all these events are happening at the same time and involve creating several files quickly, it might raise some flags. I'm thinking about scenarios where an attacker might drop multiple files as part of a payload delivery or during lateral movement within a system.

If \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known legitimate process associated with Microsoft Office updates or software installation, then this activity would be normal. But if there's uncertainty about what SDXHelper.exe does, that could increase suspicion. \n\nI should also consider whether this pattern has been seen before in similar contexts. For instance, during an update or setup of an application with multi-language support, such file creation events are expected. So, unless there are additional red flags like unexpected user accounts, unusual timestamps, or other anomalies, it might not be malicious.\n\nIn conclusion, while the activity isn't overtly suspicious, the sheer number of files being created by the same process in quick succession could warrant closer examination.
