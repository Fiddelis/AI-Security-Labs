Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few events involve processes like powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files or accessing registry values. These are somewhat normal, but seeing a lot of activity from powershell might be suspicious because it's often used in attacks.\n\nThen there are instances where svchost.exe is modifying the registry multiple times. Svchost.exe is legitimate, but malicious actors sometimes use it for persistence or other activities. The fact that it's making several changes could indicate something fishy.\n\nLooking further, I see processes like cmd.exe being used with specific command lines, such as deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\". Using command-line tools to delete tasks might be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity. Also, the use of SCHTASKS to delete a task suggests someone is trying to manage or hide their activities on the system.\n\nAnother red flag is the multiple instances where powershell.exe accesses processes and modifies registry values. This kind of behavior can be part of an attack chain, like establishing persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThere are also events involving notepad.exe and calc.exe accessing registry values. While notepad isn't typically malicious, seeing it interact with the registry might indicate it's being used as a pawn in some way.\n\nFurthermore, there are several entries where taskschd.dll is loaded by schtasks.exe. This could be normal for scheduling tasks, but combined with other events, it might point to an attacker trying to schedule or execute tasks at specific times.\n\nPutting all this together, the combination of multiple registry modifications, process creations, and deletions, especially using tools like powershell.exe and cmd.exe, suggests potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple PowerShell processes executing scripts that download files from GitHub repositories. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files under different paths like \"estrutura_temporario\/componente_padrao\/master\/LICENSE.txt\". That seems a bit suspicious because downloading arbitrary files from GitHub could be part of malicious activity, especially if these files aren't legitimate.\n\nThen, some events show the creation of files in temporary directories, such as \"$env:TEMP\\\\tarefa_geral.txt\" and others. Temporary files can be normal, but combined with the PowerShell downloads, it raises a flag. Also, there's an event where a file is created in \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\elemento_padrao.txt\". If this file was downloaded via the PowerShell script, it might be executing malicious code.\n\nLooking at other events, Chrome.exe is making several registry changes. While browsers do modify the registry for settings, multiple identical events might indicate something unusual, like a script trying to manipulate system configurations repeatedly.\n\nThere's also an event where \"MpClient.dll\" is loaded by PowerShell. That file is part of Windows Defender, so seeing it in a process that's already downloading files from GitHub could be concerning—maybe the attacker is trying to hide their activities or modify defender settings.\n\nOther events include Dns queries and file creations related to winlogbeat.exe, which might be part of log management software. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is normal behavior for that tool.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell instances downloading files from GitHub into temp directories, creating new files, and modifying system components like the registry and defender settings. These activities don't align with typical user behavior and could indicate a potential compromise or malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes downloading files from GitHub into temporary directories and creating files, along with registry modifications by Chrome.exe and conhost.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of network activity, especially DNS queries and connections as part of its operation. So maybe nothing suspicious here at first glance.\n\nThen I notice some events involving powershell.exe. The command lines show that it's downloading files from various GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory. That could be risky because PowerShell is often used for scripting and can execute arbitrary code, especially when downloading files from external sources. The URLs are pointing to different branches of repositories, which might indicate some automated process or potential malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances where powershell.exe accesses registry values and loads images. Modifying the registry can be a sign of malicious behavior since it's often used for persistence or changing system configurations. Also, creating temporary files in the TEMP directory, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1, and then deleting them could be an attempt to avoid detection by leaving no trace on the disk.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple download attempts from different GitHub paths. The fact that each command line is trying to download a file and execute it suggests possible code injection or remote execution techniques. This pattern of activity—downloading files, executing scripts, modifying system settings—is commonly associated with malicious actors trying to establish persistence or carry out attacks.\n\nPutting all this together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with these specific commands raises red flags. It's not just one-off actions; there are multiple attempts and different targets, which could indicate a broader campaign or an attempt to execute multiple modules. The deletion of temporary files adds to the concern because it shows an effort to cover tracks.\n\nI'm also considering whether this is part of normal system administration tasks or if it's truly malicious. However, the varied GitHub paths and the nature of the commands make me lean towards this being suspicious. There's no evidence of legitimate activity that would require such repeated downloads and deletions in TEMP without a clear purpose.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as INTERESTING because the combination of activities—using PowerShell to download files from external repositories, modifying system configurations, creating and deleting temporary files—is indicative of potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe downloading files from external sources into TEMP, modifying registry values, and evidence of file creation\/deletion patterns potentially indicating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I'm seeing several entries related to PowerShell being executed with various command lines. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading images.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the same processes are being executed repeatedly. For example, conhost.exe is mentioned a couple of times, along with whoami.exe and cmd.exe. These aren't necessarily malicious on their own because they can be legitimate system tools. But seeing them called in succession might raise an eyebrow.\n\nPowershell.exe appears quite frequently here. I know that PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and script-based attacks. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times could indicate suspicious activity, especially if the command lines are obfuscated or not clearly defined. However, looking at the details, most of these entries just show \"Process Create\" or \"Registry value set\" without any specific commands, so it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nAnother point to consider is the use of reg.exe and cmd.exe for registry modifications. There are several events where registry values are being set or deleted. This is concerning because attackers often modify the Windows Registry to persistence their malware or change system configurations. For instance, deleting entries like \"modulo_temporario\" and \"pacote_auxiliar\" from the Run key suggests that something might be trying to remove traces of malicious software or prevent its execution on subsequent reboots.\n\nThe command lines are another area where I should pay attention. In one event, cmd.exe is used with a command line string: \"\/c REG DELETE ...\". This looks like it's deleting a registry entry, which could be an attempt to clean up after some malicious activity. Additionally, the process name being 'conhost.exe' caught my eye because conhost is sometimes used by malware to host payloads or as a way to hide malicious processes.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is called with \"& {}\". This seems like an attempt to execute something within PowerShell without clearly showing the command. It could be using obfuscation techniques to avoid detection, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nMoreover, the repetition of these actions over time might indicate a script or automated process trying to achieve persistence or cover its tracks. The combination of registry modifications and repeated powershell executions suggests that there's an attempt to maintain presence on the system or alter configurations to hide malicious activities.\n\nI also notice that some events don't have specific file paths or command details, which makes it harder to pinpoint the exact nature of the activity. However, the pattern of behavior—multiple process creations, registry changes, and repeated powershell usage—is concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, while individual events might not be alarming on their own, the cumulative effect points towards potential malicious activities. The use of tools like powershell.exe and cmd.exe for registry manipulation, combined with the repetition of these actions, increases the suspicion level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creations, registry modifications, and repeated PowerShell executions suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let's see what each event is about.\n\nFirst, a lot of these are from powershell.exe. It starts with Image loaded tasks, which means it's loading various DLLs. These could be normal operations since PowerShell often uses .NET frameworks. Then there's a file creation and deletion in the Temp folder for a PowerShell script test. That seems suspicious because creating and then deleting a script might indicate an attempt to hide something.\n\nBut looking closer, after creating the file, it deletes it. That behavior is often seen in malware trying to clean up traces of their activity. So that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are events where processes access other processes or set registry values. For example, powershell.exe accessing other processes and setting registry entries. Those actions can be common but might also be signs of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI notice cmd.exe is involved too. It's being called with \"\/c\", which typically runs a command and then exits. If combined with the other events, this could be part of executing a script or malicious command.\n\nLooking at all these together: multiple file operations by PowerShell, deletion of temporary files, registry modifications, process accesses, and the involvement of cmd.exe. This combination raises concerns about potential malicious activity like scripting execution, persistence setup, or data exfiltration attempts.\n\nSo, considering all these events collectively, it's definitely something that needs investigation. The confidence is high because several indicators point towards possible malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of file creation and deletion by PowerShell, potential script execution attempts, and process activity indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting or not. I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event from Windows logs.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where processes like Calculator.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, and whoami.exe are involved in tasks such as creating pipes, accessing registry values, and loading images. These activities on their own might not be suspicious unless they occur in an unusual pattern or volume.\n\nHowever, the majority of events involve powershell.exe. It's running with various command lines, including some that execute scripts like Remove-Item to delete files in the TEMP directory. Additionally, there are multiple instances where powershell is accessing other processes and registry entries, which could be indicative of script execution or lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe high frequency of powershell.exe activities is concerning. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate scripting but also frequently abused by attackers for command-and-control (C2) communications and payload delivery. The presence of commands like Remove-Item suggests potential file deletion, which might be part of an attempt to cover tracks or remove malicious files.\n\nMoreover, the events show a combination of process creations, registry modifications, image loads, and file operations—all common in both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. This variety of actions raises suspicion as attackers often use multiple techniques to maintain persistence and hide their traces.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—multiple suspicious PowerShell commands, file deletions, and unusual activity patterns—the batch as a whole appears relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts, including deletion of files in TEMP directory, combined with other suspicious activities like registry modifications and process access, indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I have a batch of system logs from various processes, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with specific command lines. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute scripts, so repeated instances might indicate malicious activity. The commands involve removing files from the TEMP directory, which could be part of an attempt to clean up traces or delete evidence.\n\nThere are also several registry value sets and process accesses logged. These actions can be a red flag because they often correspond to changes in system configurations that malware might perform to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nFurthermore, there's a file creation and subsequent deletion of a PowerShell script in the TEMP directory. This is suspicious because it suggests that a script was created but then removed, possibly to avoid detection or to test execution without leaving traces.\n\nWhile some events could be legitimate (like legitimate script testing), the combination of multiple powershell.exe instances with file deletions from TEMP and registry modifications raises concerns about potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions, file deletions in Temp directory, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. The logs are all in JSONL format, each line is a separate event.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so that's something to pay attention to. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\n1. The first few events show ImageLoad tasks related to various DLL files loaded by powershell.exe. These include mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are standard .NET framework components, so on their own they might not be suspicious unless they're being used in a way that's unusual.\n\n2. There's an event where a file is created: __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1 in the Temp directory. Then immediately after, it's deleted. This seems odd because creating and then deleting a script file could be part of testing or persistence mechanisms, but it might also just be cleanup after some legitimate process.\n\n3. There are multiple events where powershell.exe is used with Remove-Item commands to delete files in the TEMP directory. The paths being deleted vary slightly: tarefa_base.zip, componente_comum.zip, etc. It's a bit unusual to see so many specific files being removed unless it's part of some automated process or an attempt to clean up evidence.\n\n4. Some events show Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks from powershell.exe, which could relate to script execution or termination. These might be normal if scripts are running as part of legitimate processes, but in the context of multiple deletions, they raise a flag.\n\n5. There are two events involving chrome.exe: one registry change and another ImageLoad for MpOAV.dll. These seem less concerning on their own, but I should check if there's any correlation between these and the powershell activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the pattern here is multiple file deletions in the TEMP directory using powershell.exe, with some creation and deletion of a script file. The repeated use of Remove-Item commands suggests either automated cleanup or attempts to remove specific files that might be suspicious. While some of these actions could be part of normal system operations, the volume and specificity of the files being deleted, along with the involvement of powershell.exe, are concerning.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because it raises questions about what those files contained and why they were deleted in such a specific manner. The confidence isn't too high, maybe around 0.6, because while some of these actions are red flags, others could potentially be part of legitimate processes, like script testing or cleanup routines.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletions in the TEMP directory using powershell.exe and creation\/deletion of a PowerShell script suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system logs to analyze. Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice several events where powershell.exe is being used with commands that remove files from the TEMP directory. The command lines look like they're deleting specific .txt files, which might be part of a cleanup routine. But then again, attackers often delete logs or traces of their activities, so this could be suspicious.\n\nNext, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its data directory. That seems normal if it's just the tool doing its job, but I'm not entirely sure about the implications here. It might be part of log management and isn't necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nLooking further down, powershell.exe is loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That sounds legitimate because Defender uses PowerShell for some tasks. But I should check if this is a common behavior or if it's out of place.\n\nThere are multiple Registry value sets by both PowerShell and Chrome. While Chrome sometimes writes to the registry for settings, multiple such events without context could be part of an exploit or persistence mechanism. It might indicate that something is trying to modify system configurations stealthily.\n\nWhoami.exe being run from system32 is interesting. It's a common tool for users to check permissions, but it can also be used by attackers to gather information about the system. The fact that it's appearing more than once makes me think there might be some automated process or script running it.\n\nThen, RuntimeBroker.exe writing to the registry—Runtime Broker is part of UAC and Windows Update, so this could be normal, but again, multiple writes without a clear reason might be worth looking into.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a mix of legitimate processes like winlogbeat and Defender-related activities, along with unusual PowerShell behavior and repeated Registry modifications. The combination of deleting files in TEMP, using whoami, and multiple Registry changes could indicate malicious activity trying to stay under the radar or clean up traces.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if each event is bad on its own, but the pattern seems concerning. It's possible that an attacker is attempting to remove logs, modify system settings for persistence, and gather information. However, without more context like timestamps or known patterns of this user's activity, it's hard to be certain.\n\nI think the batch does warrant investigation because some of these actions could be signs of compromise. The confidence isn't super high since individual events might not be malicious, but together they raise red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands deleting files in TEMP directory, repeated Registry modifications by Chrome and other processes, suspicious use of whoami.exe, and file creation activities may indicate potential malicious behavior or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I see several entries where the process is powershell.exe with a task of ProcessAccess. PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be a red flag because it's commonly associated with malicious activities like command-line attacks. However, just seeing ProcessAccess might not always mean something bad—it could be normal administrative tasks.\n\nThen there are events where whoami.exe is being executed. Whoami is a standard Windows tool to check user information. It's usually harmless unless it's part of a larger attack chain, like gathering system info for later use. The command line shows it's running from the system32 directory, which is normal.\n\nI also notice that these events are repeating multiple times—like powershell.exe being accessed several times and whoami.exe being created a few times. This repetition might indicate automated behavior or part of a script. But without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nLooking further down, there’s an entry for winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. Winlogbeat is likely the agent used to collect and send logs, so this seems benign—it's just doing its job by updating configuration files.\n\nThe last two events involve powershell.exe creating a file called pacote_ativo.txt. The path is in the Downloads folder, which makes sense if someone is running scripts from there. But again, it depends on what's inside that file—without knowing the content, it's hard to assess.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and creating files, along with whoami.exe executions. While individually these could be normal, the volume might raise an eyebrow. However, without evidence of unusual behavior, such as failed logins, writes to sensitive areas, or known malicious file hashes, I'm leaning towards it not being interesting. But there's a slight uncertainty because repeated powershell use and file creation could hint at something more.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes like PowerShell access and whoami.exe execution, which are common activities without evidence of malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
