Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". This could be suspicious because executing remote commands can indicate malicious activity, especially if it's done repeatedly without a clear reason.\n\nThen, I notice an event where 'powershell.exe' is used with some command-line arguments. The script being executed creates a scheduled task that runs calc.exe at logon with elevated privileges. That's concerning because using PowerShell to create persistent tasks can be a common tactic in attacks for persistence.\n\nLooking further, there are events involving WmiPrvSE.exe and svchost.exe interacting with the registry and files like taskschd.dll. These processes are often involved in legitimate system operations, but unusual interactions or repeated actions might indicate something malicious.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created in the Tasks folder named 'unidade_comum', which seems suspicious as it's a custom task that wasn't previously known. Additionally, more events show svchost.exe creating files and modifying registry entries, which could be signs of malware attempting to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nAnother point is the use of conhost.exe and chrome.exe accessing the registry and loading DLLs, which might be part of normal operations but could also be indicators if these processes are behaving abnormally.\n\nLastly, there are some legitimate events from winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe related to file creation in their own directories, which don't seem suspicious on their own but when combined with other events might raise flags.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated remote command executions, use of PowerShell for creating a scheduled task, and unusual file and registry activity suggest potential malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is classified as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show multiple instances of remote command execution and suspicious process activities such as the creation of a scheduled task with calc.exe using PowerShell, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL events, each with process info, winlog task, and file details.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the first few entries. They all have 'powershell.exe' in the command line. The command lines are creating scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe on startup. That seems suspicious because using powershell to create a persistent task could be part of malicious activity, like installing backdoors or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI notice each event has slightly different names for the scheduled tasks: 'unidade_ativo', 'tarefa_base', etc. This variation might indicate an attempt to avoid detection by creating multiple tasks with varying names. It's possible that an attacker is trying different task names to see which ones get through without being noticed.\n\nAlso, all these tasks are set to run under the Administrators group with highest privileges. That's a red flag because having such high-level permissions could allow for more destructive actions once executed. Malware often uses such techniques to ensure persistence and elevated privileges.\n\nLooking further down, there are events where powershell.exe is accessing processes and modifying registry values. These could be related to setting up the scheduled tasks or perhaps other configurations. The fact that multiple registry writes happen might be part of creating these tasks or ensuring they persist across reboots.\n\nThere's also an entry where 'chrome.exe' creates a pipe and modifies the registry. While chrome is a legitimate process, unexpected behavior like creating pipes or modifying reg entries could indicate tampering, especially if it's in conjunction with other suspicious activities from powershell.\n\nAnother point is that some events don't have file paths associated with them, which might mean they're just command-line executions without writing to files. This could be part of a memory-resident attack where the payload doesn't touch disk, making it harder to detect.\n\nPutting this together, there are multiple instances of powershell creating scheduled tasks, each potentially malicious, along with other signs like registry modifications and process access. The combination suggests possible malicious activity aimed at persistence and privilege escalation. While I'm not 100% certain without more context, the pattern is concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes are creating scheduled tasks with high privileges to execute calc.exe on startup, showing potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events that I need to analyze. My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first eight events all look similar. Each has a process named \"chrome.exe\" and the winlog task is about setting a registry value. The file field is None in all of these. So, this seems repetitive—Chrome making changes to the Windows Registry. I know that applications often write to the registry when they run or update settings, so maybe this isn't unusual.\n\nThe ninth event still has \"chrome.exe\" but now the winlog task is a DNS query. That makes sense too because Chrome would need to resolve domain names for websites you're visiting. So nothing odd here either.\n\nThen there's an event from \"winlogbeat.exe\". It created a file in the path specified, which looks like it's related to the data directory of Winlogbeat itself. I'm not super familiar with that tool, but assuming it's log management software, creating configuration files is normal during setup or updates.\n\nThe last event is Powershell.exe creating a file called \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\". Now, Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities. The filename translates to something like \"auxiliary object,\" which isn't inherently suspicious but could be a red flag depending on context. However, I don't see any other indicators here that suggest it's part of malicious activity. It's just creating a file in the user's Downloads folder.\n\nLooking at all these events together, most are standard activities for Chrome and legitimate system processes. The only thing that catches my eye is the Powershell.exe creating a file with an unusual name, but without additional context or suspicious behavior (like executing scripts, accessing restricted resources, etc.), it doesn't seem enough to warrant immediate investigation.\n\nI should also consider whether there's any pattern across events. For example, multiple registry writes by Chrome could be normal if it's updating settings frequently. The DNS query is also part of typical browsing activity. Winlogbeat and Powershell activities don't appear to be out of place based on the given info.\n\nGiven all this, I think the batch isn't particularly interesting for investigation unless there are more events showing malicious patterns. Each individual event doesn't raise a red flag when viewed in isolation, and collectively they don't paint a concerning picture.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes such as Chrome modifying registry values, performing DNS queries, Winlogbeat creating configuration files, and Powershell creating a file. These activities are typical and do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let's see... There are multiple entries here, all in JSONL format. Each line is an event with process info, winlog task, and file details.\n\nFirst, a lot of these events involve powershell.exe. I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities because it has so many capabilities. So when I see multiple instances where powershell.exe is involved, especially loading images or creating files, my radar goes up a bit.\n\nLooking closer, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe. It's loading different DLLs like clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll. That in itself might be normal if it's running scripts or legitimate commands, but when combined with other actions, it could indicate something more.\n\nThen I notice a FileCreate event for a PowerShell script: __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. The naming looks a bit suspicious—random characters after the underscores and .gde.ps1 extension. That might be an attempt to create a temporary script, which could be part of malicious activity. After creating this file, there's a FileDeleteDetected event, so it was deleted shortly after being created. This pattern is interesting because attackers often delete their traces quickly.\n\nNext, there's a process command line that stands out: powershell.exe executing some code to create a scheduled task. The script uses New-ScheduledTaskAction and registers it with calc.exe as the action. It specifies BUILTIN\\Administrators group with Highest run level, which is a red flag because such elevated privileges could be used for persistence or malicious tasks.\n\nThen, I see several Registry value set events from chrome.exe. At first glance, this might seem normal since browsers interact with the registry often. But when paired with other suspicious activities, especially around timing or frequency, it could warrant closer inspection. Additionally, there are multiple such events, which could be part of a broader campaign to modify system configurations.\n\nLastly, there are a series of events where process is None and winlog task is Execute a Remote Command. This is a bit concerning because a null process might indicate an attempt to mask the actual command's origin or to bypass certain security measures. It suggests that some external or remote activity is taking place, which could be malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances with suspicious file operations, script creation\/deletion, scheduled task setup with elevated privileges, and registry modifications from chrome.exe, along with execute remote command events from a null process—these collectively create a concerning pattern. They seem to align with common tactics used in cyberattacks, such as persistence via scheduled tasks, deletion of evidence, and use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nI'm also considering the volume and types of these events. While some might be normal, the combination points towards potential malicious behavior rather than just routine activities. The fact that several different actions are happening around the same time, involving both powershell.exe and chrome.exe, adds to the suspicion.\n\nSo, after analyzing all these together, I think this batch is definitely interesting for investigation because it exhibits multiple red flags indicative of possible cyberattack activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe loading images and creating\/deleting files, a suspicious script creation and deletion, registry modifications by chrome.exe, and remote command execution with null process indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
