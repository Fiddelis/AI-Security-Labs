{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events. First off, I notice multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with various commands like `net user`, `get-localuser`, and others. These commands are typically used to manage users and groups on a system, which could indicate someone is trying to gather information about the system's security configuration.\n\nLooking deeper, there are repeated calls to `powershell.exe` and subsequent executions of `net.exe` and `net1.exe`. The use of `net user` without any obvious legitimate purpose in this context raises flags. Additionally, the events related to `cmdkey.exe \/list` might be attempting to list stored credentials, which is a common tactic for credential dumping during an attack.\n\nThe log entries also show multiple instances of tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which are often associated with process creation and termination events. The repeated occurrence of these tasks could indicate that the malicious script is running multiple times or in different processes to evade detection.\n\nFurthermore, there's a notable absence of file writes or reads beyond the initial PowerShell execution, but the combination of system queries and potential credential access suggests a possible compromise. The later entries about 'Security Group Management' might be part of an attacker's lateral movement within the network after gaining initial access.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the pattern of repeated PowerShell commands accessing user information and group memberships is highly indicative of malicious activity. This makes the batch interesting for further investigation as it shows signs of potential unauthorized system access or data gathering.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands to gather user information and list credentials, along with repeated process creation events, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events. The user has provided several JSONL entries, each representing different system activities. My job is to analyze all these together and decide if they're interesting or not for an investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of the processes are related to PowerShell.exe. This immediately raises my antenna because PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by both admins and attackers for legitimate and malicious purposes. Now, let's dig deeper into each event.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe accessing something with 'ProcessAccess', which is normal since it's just running. But then there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is creating files in the Temp directory. Specifically, a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1 is created and then immediately deleted. That's a bit odd. Creating and deleting a script file quickly could be a way to test if certain policies are enforced or to avoid detection by security tools.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the events, it has a long string with various commands: net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe, ls, dir, etc. These seem like they're querying system information—looking at users, groups, and disk contents. This could be part of reconnaissance to gather information about the system, which is often a precursor to more malicious activities.\n\nAnother point of interest is that several events involve registry changes. Modifying the Windows Registry can allow persistence or change system configurations, which again is something attackers might do to maintain access or alter security settings.\n\nI also notice multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs related to .NET and others. This isn't inherently malicious, but in combination with other activities, it could be part of loading modules that have specific functionality, possibly malicious.\n\nThe repeated occurrence of the same command line across several events suggests a script or batch process running multiple times, which might indicate an automated attack or testing phase. The use of ampersand (&) to chain commands is common in scripts and can be used to execute multiple malicious actions without user interaction.\n\nConsidering all these points together: multiple powershell.exe instances, file creation\/deletion in Temp, registry modifications, script execution attempts, and repeated command lines—this batch shows a pattern that could be indicative of malicious activity. The behavior isn't entirely conclusive on its own, but the combination of factors raises enough red flags to merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands including user enumeration, group membership checks, and file system traversal, combined with the creation and deletion of a script file in the Temp directory, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, each line a separate event. There are 20 events here. The fields present in each event include 'process', 'winlog', and 'file'. \n\nLooking at the first few events, they're related to security group management tasks. For example, one has 'task': 'Security Group Management' in winlog. This seems like legitimate Windows activity, probably part of user or system administration.\n\nThen I notice some cmdkey.exe processes. The command line is pointing to listing keys, which could be for credential dumping. That's a red flag because unauthorized use of such tools can indicate potential compromise.\n\nNext, there are multiple powershell.exe entries with different tasks like ProcessAccess and FileCreate. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The file creations point to specific paths in the user's Downloads and AppData folders, which might be storing malicious scripts or data. \n\nI also see net.exe and net1.exe being used with 'localgroup' commands. These are often part of privilege escalation techniques. Using these tools without proper authorization could indicate an attacker trying to gain more system access.\n\nThere's a cmdkey.exe command line that stands out: \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\cmdkey.exe\" \/list. This is a known method for credential dumping, which is a serious sign of potential compromise.\n\nOther events involve RuntimeBroker.exe, conhost.exe, and svchost.exe accessing registry values. While these are legitimate processes, unusual registry activity can sometimes indicate malicious behavior, especially if it's not part of the standard system operations.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe running without arguments might be used to check user privileges. If this is done by an unauthorized entity, it could be a prelude to further attacks.\n\nLooking at image loads for urlmon.dll in both calc.exe and Calculator.exe processes seems odd but could be related to legitimate Windows functions or possibly some form of code injection, which isn't conclusive on its own.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows multiple instances where potentially malicious tools are being used. The combination of cmdkey.exe for credential dumping, net.exe for group management, powershell.exe with file creations in user folders, and other suspicious processes all point towards possible unauthorized activity. While some events could be legitimate admin tasks, the overall pattern raises concerns about a potential security incident.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as INTERESTING because there are several red flags that together suggest malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicative of potential unauthorized activity, such as credential dumping attempts using cmdkey.exe and net.exe for group management. PowerShell is used with file creations in user directories, suggesting possible script execution. The combination raises concerns about a security incident.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
