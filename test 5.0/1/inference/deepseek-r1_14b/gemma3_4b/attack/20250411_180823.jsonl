For example, cmd.exe is used to create scheduled tasks that run calc.exe on startup or logon. Also, schtasks.exe is creating tasks like \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" which also run calc.exe as a command.\n\nAnother point of concern is the repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with suspicious commands. Powershell being accessed might indicate potential scripting activity, often used in attacks. The fact that multiple processes are accessing registry values could be an attempt to modify system configurations or hide malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, several events show image loads from system32, which is a common location for legitimate DLLs but can also be used by malware to load malicious components undetected.\n\nTaking all these together—scheduled tasks executing calc.exe, multiple process creations with potentially malicious command lines, registry modifications, and file creations—it seems like there's a pattern of activity that might indicate unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms. These behaviors could be signs of a possible security incident, making the batch relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creations and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity, including scheduled tasks running calc.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. There are several entries where Chrome is making registry changes— Registry value set events. That's a bit unusual because Chrome doesn't typically modify the Windows registry in normal operations. Now, seeing this multiple times might indicate some form of tampering or customization.\n\nThen there are two instances where PowerShell was accessed and one where whoami.exe was run. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for lateral movement or executing commands. The fact that it's being accessed could be suspicious, but without more context on what exactly was done in those sessions, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nWhoami.exe is commonly used to check user information, which isn't inherently malicious, but when combined with other actions like PowerShell access and multiple registry changes, it raises an eyebrow. The repeated Chrome activity stands out the most to me because it's not a typical behavior for that process.\n\nPutting it all together, these events don't conclusively prove malicious intent, but they do present some red flags. The combination of registry modifications by Chrome and the use of tools like PowerShell could be indicators of potential compromise or investigation-worthy activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of chrome.exe modifying the registry and powershell.exe being accessed, along with whoami.exe execution, indicate potential malicious activity that warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are from various processes like svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, etc., performing tasks such as Registry value sets, file creations, and image loads. Some of these seem normal because many system processes interact with the registry and load necessary DLLs.\n\nI notice that svchost.exe appears multiple times setting registry values. Svchost is a legitimate Windows process, often used by services, so this alone might not be suspicious. However, if it's doing too much activity or accessing unexpected areas of the registry, it could raise flags. But in this batch, there's no indication of that.\n\nThere are events from chrome.exe setting registry values multiple times. While Chrome is a common application and some registry interactions are normal, excessive writes might be concerning, especially if they're to unusual keys. However, without more context on what exactly is being modified, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nI also see that powershell.exe created a file named 'unidade_ativo.txt' in the user's downloads folder. Powershell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious purposes. The filename seems generic, so it's not immediately suspicious, but paired with other activities, it might warrant closer look.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where processes like winlogbeat.exe and chrome.exe create or load files, which could be part of their normal operation or data collection behavior.\n\nConsidering all these points, while some actions might seem unusual at first glance, they don't collectively indicate malicious activity. The majority of the events appear to be normal system operations, especially since many are from well-known processes performing expected tasks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist mostly of normal system processes performing standard actions like registry modifications and file creations. No clear signs of malicious activity emerge when considering the batch as a whole.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
