Let's go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of networking and DNS lookups. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen I notice powershell.exe appearing multiple times. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to pay attention to. The events show process access, registry modifications, image loads, file creation, deletion, and pipe creation. These actions can be part of normal operations, but they might also indicate something more nefarious.\n\nLooking closer, there's a command line in one of the PowerShell processes: it's using Get-ChildItem on a path that seems to involve \"..\\unidade_ativo\". The use of \"..\" suggests navigating directories, which could be an attempt to access restricted areas. Modifying LastWriteTime to a very early date (January 1, 1970) might be an attempt to hide file activity or make it look older, which is a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are multiple registry value sets by PowerShell and other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe. While these could be part of legitimate operations, repeated registry modifications can sometimes be indicators of malicious activity, especially if they're done by scripts or less common tools.\n\nThe file creation and deletion in the Temp directory with a specific script name (\"__PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1\") is concerning. Temporary files created and then deleted quickly can be signs of scripting trying to avoid detection. The fact that it's using PowerShell for this makes it more suspicious.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple instances of powershell.exe with various activities, including file manipulation, registry changes, and temporary script creation\/deletion. These actions could be part of a malicious payload trying to establish persistence or perform some unauthorized tasks on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes show suspicious activity, including file manipulation, registry changes, and temporary script creation\/deletion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm new to cybersecurity analysis, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, I look at each event and note what's happening. There are multiple entries where different processes are performing various tasks.\n\nStarting with ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because Windows apps often interact with the registry.\n\nNext, Calculator.exe doing the same registry set task. Again, not too concerning on its own since many legitimate programs access the registry.\n\nThen there's PowerShell.exe making two types of events: one for registry changes and another for process access. I know that PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The registry change could be normal admin work, but combined with process access, maybe something suspicious? I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, Chrome.exe appears a lot with multiple RegistryEvent tasks. That stands out because Chrome shouldn't need to make so many registry changes. Maybe it's being used maliciously or there's some extension causing issues.\n\nThere are also ImageLoad events for Chrome loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those seem legitimate as they're Windows system files and part of antivirus software, respectively.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file is probably just the log shipping tool doing its job, so nothing to worry here.\n\nAnother event has PowerShell.exe creating a file named unidade_logico.txt in the Downloads folder. That's interesting because attackers sometimes use custom filenames for data exfiltration or persistence. But it's hard to tell without contextâ€”maybe it's a legitimate script creating a log file?\n\nThe rest of the events are Chrome making multiple registry changes, which as I thought before, seems excessive and possibly suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated RegistryEvent tasks by Chrome could indicate malicious activity, especially if they're not typical for the user. PowerShell's process access and file creation might be part of an attack chain. However, there's no clear evidence of harmful actions beyond these events. They could still be benign, but the volume from Chrome raises a red flag.\n\nI'm a bit uncertain because sometimes legitimate software can have unusual behaviors, especially if it's misconfigured or has extensions doing background tasks. But considering the number of registry writes and the use of PowerShell, which is often abused in attacks, I lean towards this batch being interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of RegistryEvent tasks by Chrome.exe, potential suspicious activity; PowerShell.exe events including process access and file creation; repeated RegistryEvent tasks may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event and see if anything stands out.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several events where PowerShell is being executed with specific command lines. Each command line seems to be using `Get-ChildItem` to target certain files in various directories, and then setting their LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\". That date looks suspicious because it's the Unix epoch start time, often used in attacks to reset file timestamps. This could be an attempt to hide malicious activity by making files look older or newer than they actually are.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with these PowerShell executions, most are under \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\". These might not be typical activities for a legitimate user running scripts. Usually, such events would be more frequent in automated processes or during system updates, but seeing multiple instances could indicate something fishy.\n\nNext, there's an event where svchost.exe is involved in setting registry values. SvcHost is a common process used by various services, so it's not inherently suspicious, but repeated registry modifications without clear purpose can be a red flag. This might be part of an attempt to modify system configurations or create persistence points for malicious software.\n\nAnother event shows Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. While this could just be normal operation, the combination with other events raises concern. Legitimate applications shouldn't typically load such DLLs unless there's some kind of injection happening.\n\nThere are also a few events involving file creations and loads of specific files like MpClient.dll by PowerShell. This might be part of an attack chain where malicious scripts are trying to execute or create new files in unexpected locations, possibly for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nThe last event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. While this could be normal if it's related to log management tools, the presence of other suspicious activities makes me question whether this is part of an attacker's toolkit trying to cover their tracks or set up monitoring evasion techniques.\n\nPutting all these together, the repeated use of PowerShell with unusual command-line arguments, setting registry values without clear reason, and the combination with other processes like svchost.exe and Calculator.exe suggest potential malicious activity. The pattern of file modifications and timestamp changes is particularly concerning as it's a common tactic in cyberattacks to erase traces.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely certain if these activities are definitively malicious or could be part of some legitimate process. But given the combination of multiple indicators like unusual PowerShell commands, registry edits, and file timestamp manipulations, the risk seems high enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities with potentially malicious command lines altering file timestamps, combined with svchost.exe modifying registry values and other unusual process executions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
