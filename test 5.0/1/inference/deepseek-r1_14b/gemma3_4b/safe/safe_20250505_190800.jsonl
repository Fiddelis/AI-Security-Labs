{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of log events to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so its repeated use could be concerning. The command line in these logs shows that powershell.exe is running scripts or modules, which might indicate script execution.\n\nLooking deeper, there are file creation and deletion events involving a temporary .ps1 file: __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1. This suggests that a script was created, executed, and then deleted. Such behavior can be a red flag because it might be part of an attempt to execute malicious code temporarily, leaving minimal traces.\n\nAdditionally, there are several ImageLoad events for various DLLs loaded by powershell.exe, including mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. While these are legitimate .NET framework components, the frequency and combination with other actions could raise suspicions about potential code injection or lateral movement within a system.\n\nThe FileDeleteDetected event indicates that a file was deleted, which might be an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activity. This deletion happened right after the file was created, which is a common tactic in attacks to cover tracks.\n\nFurthermore, there are multiple Provider Lifecycle events for powershell.exe, which could relate to PowerShell's internal initialization processes but combined with other activities might signal something more nefarious like loading malicious modules or establishing persistence mechanisms.\n\nTaking all these points together—the repeated use of PowerShell, the creation and deletion of a script file, and the DLLs being loaded—it seems plausible that this batch of logs indicates suspicious activity. While it's possible that a user is running legitimate scripts, the combination of events, especially the temporary script file and multiple image loads, makes me lean towards classifying this as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe execution, file creation\/deletion activities, and DLL loading indicate potential malicious behavior or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by going through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal because winlogbeat is likely just setting up its configuration. No red flags here.\n\nNext, powershell.exe creates a file namedteste.ps1. PowerShell scripts can be legitimate but are often used for malicious activities. I'll keep an eye on how this script behaves.\n\nLooking at the third event again, it's another FileCreate from winlogbeat.exe, which we've already determined is normal.\n\nThe fourth event shows powershell.exe setting a registry value. Registry changes can be part of legitimate operations but also often used in malware for persistence or configuration. This could be suspicious depending on what exactly was changed.\n\nFifth event is the process creation of powershell.exe with a command line argument pointing to the script teste.ps1 and using Bypass ExecutionPolicy. Using -ExecutionPolicy Bypass is a common tactic to run scripts that would otherwise be blocked, which raises my concern level.\n\nNext, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These might be legitimate for running PowerShell scripts, but sometimes attackers load malicious libraries. I need more context on these DLLs.\n\nThen, FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events on a temp file __PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1. This temporary script creation is suspicious because it's testing the script policy, which might indicate an attempt to bypass restrictions or check for execution permissions.\n\nAnother FileCreate event in the StartupProfileData folder could be part of legitimate profile loading, but combined with other events, it might suggest something malicious is trying to run at startup.\n\nFinally, there's a Remote Command execution event. This is definitely concerning because executing remote commands can lead to arbitrary code execution and lateral movement in a network. It's a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances creating files, modifying the registry, loading modules, testing script policies, and executing remote commands. These activities are often indicative of command-line attack tools being used, possibly for lateral movement or data exfiltration. The use of -ExecutionPolicy Bypass is a big red flag, as it's commonly associated with malicious scripts trying to run without user consent.\n\nSo, considering all these events together, there's a clear pattern suggesting potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including PowerShell script execution with Bypass policy and remote command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
