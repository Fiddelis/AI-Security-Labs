I don't see any indicators of malicious activity here, like file paths that shouldn't be accessed by such processes or unusual filenames.\n\nSince all events are from the same process and related to Microsoft Office's operation, it doesn't seem like anything out of place.

The task is consistently \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate\". The files are all in the same path structure, varying only by the filename suffix.\n\nHmm, so all these events are from the same executable creating multiple files in an Office-related directory. I know that legitimate software often creates temporary or configuration files when running. Microsoft Office solutions sometimes deploy files to OfflineFiles for caching or performance reasons, especially with features like Copilot which might need various string resources.\n\nThe paths look standard for user-specific app data. The repeated creation of similar-named JavaScript files could be part of a normal update process or initial setup of an Office feature. Since all events are from the same process and in the same directory, it doesn't seem suspicious at first glance.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity here.

Each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. The classification needs to be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nLooking at the data, each event has three main components: process info, winlog details, and file information.\n\nThe process name in all events is \"SDXHelper.exe\". I know that SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office's Copilot feature. It's used for managing and caching certain files, especially those related to AI features within Excel. So, this is a legitimate system process.\n\nEach event under winlog shows the task as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means that a file was created on the system. The file paths provided all point to JavaScript files located in the Office Solution Packages directory. These are typically used by Office add-ins or features like Copilot to store resources locally for faster access.\n\nI notice that each event creates a different JS file, but they all follow a naming convention with long GUIDs or hashes as filenames. This is normal because when Office packages update or cache new files, multiple small files might be created to store different parts of the resources.\n\nAnother thing I observe is that some JS files are duplicated in two events each. For example, the file \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_a447e403fce55f0d8f880238761b0c85.js\" appears twice. This duplication might be due to multiple writes or caching mechanisms ensuring the files are present.\n\nConsidering all these points, I don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The process is legitimate, the actions are standard file creation events related to Office features, and there's no indication of unusual behavior such as access to restricted areas, failed logins, or unexpected process executions. \n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't raise any red flags for investigation.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object representing some log entry. The first thing I notice is that all the lines are identical except for the file paths. Each line starts with \"process\":{\"name\":\"SDXHelper.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":... followed by different hashes in the path.\n\nSo, each event is a log of a file creation by SDXHelper.exe. The same process name and task type every time. The files are all under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages with some specific GUID-like directory. Then inside that, there's a PackageResources\\OfflineFiles folder where multiple .js files are being created.\n\nHmm, I know SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Office add-ins or solutions. These files being created in the OfflineFiles folder probably have something to do with Excel's Copilot features. The filenames include hashes which might be part of some versioning or resource identification.\n\nLooking at how many events there are: each .js file path seems unique, but I see that some files appear twice. For example, the one ending with '76826bebf9766d76354abacbd3b721ca.js' is logged twice. Same with others like '7840f8483f682308e9457dc2e801eb55.js'. So, there's duplication in the file creation events.\n\nNow, why would this be interesting or not? Well, if an application is generating multiple files as part of its normal operation, repeated file creation might just be standard behavior. In this case, since it's under Microsoft Office and related to Copilot strings, it seems like legitimate activity for a feature that requires offline access to these JavaScript resources.\n\nBut wait, could there be something suspicious here? Let me think: the same process creating multiple files in a specific pattern. Maybe if the number of events was unusually high beyond normal operation, or if the file paths were pointing to unusual locations, it might warrant investigation. But since all these are within expected Office-related directories and the process is known, this doesn't look malicious.\n\nHowever, the fact that each event is identical except for the filename makes me think: why so many? Could this be a sign of some kind of script or automated process writing unnecessary files? Or maybe it's part of a legitimate update mechanism. Since all events are coming from the same source and there's no indication of failed attempts, errors, or access issues, I don't see red flags here.\n\nAnother angle: is SDXHelper.exe known to create multiple JavaScript files in this manner? A quick check tells me that it's related to Office add-ins and often handles dynamic resources. So, the activity described fits within its expected behavior.\n\nAlso, since all events are labeled as \"File created,\" there's no indication of other types of activities like deletions or access attempts. No anomalies in timestamps either, assuming they're sequential.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple file creation events from a legitimate process in a standard location for Office features. It doesn't seem to indicate malicious behavior but rather normal operation. However, the duplication might be worth looking into if it's not usual for this process—like maybe temporary files being recreated unnecessarily—but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nI think the main points are:\n1. All events from a known legitimate process.\n2. Files created in expected locations related to Office features.\n3. Duplication but within normal operational parameters of that feature.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't seem particularly interesting for investigation unless there's more context indicating something's wrong with this specific activity pattern.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent legitimate file creation activities by a known Microsoft Office-related process.

The same process is creating multiple JavaScript files with different hashes in the filename. This seems repetitive and could be part of normal operations, especially since these paths are related to Microsoft Office's OfflineFiles, which suggests they're legitimate.\n\nThere are two instances where \"MdSched.exe\" is started without any associated file creation events. MdSched is a known Windows process for managing scheduled tasks, so its execution alone isn't suspicious unless there's unusual behavior around it, which isn't evident here.\n\nTwo other events involve \"consent.exe\" loading system DLLs (\"amsi.dll\" and \"urlmon.dll\"). These are standard operations as these DLLs handle security features like Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) and URL handling.

Let me start by looking at each event.\n\nEach line is a JSON object representing an event. The key parts are the process name, the type of Windows log task, and the file path that was created.\n\nThe process name in all these events is \"SDXHelper.exe\". I'm trying to recall if this is a known legitimate process or something malicious. From what I remember, SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office's solution packages, so it might be part of Office itself or some add-ons.\n\nLooking at the task, each event says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So these are file creation events. The files being created are located in paths under \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\\\\\" and similar locations. These look like standard directories where Office might store temporary or package-related files.\n\nThe specific file paths include various .js files, such as \"excel-copilot-strings_...\" and \"vendors~code-preview-dialog_...\". These seem to be JavaScript resources, possibly for add-ins or features within Excel, like Copilot. Since these are under the SolutionPackages directory, it makes sense that they're part of Office's functionality.\n\nNow, considering whether this batch is interesting. Are repeated file creations by a legitimate process a sign of something malicious? Usually, if an attacker is trying to hide files or create persistence, they might use more obfuscation or less predictable naming conventions. These file names are quite long but follow a pattern, which is typical for resource files in software.\n\nMoreover, these events all come from the same process and target known areas of the filesystem. There's no indication of unusual access times, multiple failed attempts, or other red flags like writes to unexpected locations.\n\nI should also think about the volume of events. Here there are 14 entries, each creating a different file. While that might seem high, it could be part of a legitimate process installing or updating several resources at once. Since all events are consistent and don't show any anomalies beyond what's expected from an Office-related process, I'm leaning towards them not being suspicious.\n\nTherefore, the batch is likely \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities are normal for the SDXHelper.exe process and involve standard file operations in known directories.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creation by a legitimate Microsoft Office-related process (SDXHelper.exe) within expected locations, indicating normal activity rather than malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

So, the user has provided a batch of system log events in JSONL format and wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each event. Looking at the events, they all have the same structure: process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\", the task is \"File created\", and the file path varies but seems to be within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, specifically under OfflineFiles with various JavaScript files.\n\nI notice that there are multiple entries with similar paths but different filenames. For example, several events have paths like \"...82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\" followed by different JS file names. The same goes for the other package GUIDs.\n\nNow, I should consider what's normal here. Microsoft Office often uses SolutionPackages to store data and resources used by add-ins or components. OfflineFiles likely refers to files being saved locally when working offline. It's common for such packages to create multiple JavaScript files as part of their operation, especially if they're loading different modules or assets.\n\nThe process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" is associated with Microsoft Office. From what I know, SDX stands for Solution Distribution eXperience, and these helpers are used to deploy and manage Office add-ins. So, it's normal for this process to create files in the specified locations.\n\nLooking at the timestamps might be useful if they were provided, but since they're not, I can't tell how frequent these file creations are happening. However, given that there are multiple identical events, it suggests either a repeated legitimate activity or perhaps something malicious attempting to log multiple actions quickly.\n\nAnother point is the filenames themselves. They all end with .js and have long GUID-like prefixes. This seems consistent with how JavaScript files might be stored in such packages, each serving a specific purpose or version.\n\nI should also check if there's any indication of unusual behavior beyond what's normal for this process. Since all events are file creation attempts by the same process and in expected locations, there's no evidence of access to restricted areas or activities outside the scope of typical Office operations.\n\nIn summary, these logs appear to be part of Microsoft Office's normal operation when handling offline files for its add-ins. There's nothing here that stands out as malicious or indicative of a security issue. The repeated file creations are likely due to legitimate reasons related to how Office manages its components and resources.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions by SDXHelper.exe within expected Microsoft Office directories, which is normal behavior for managing offline files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of JSONL events to analyze. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of each JSON object, they all have three main components: process, winlog, and file. The process name is consistently \"SDXHelper.exe\", which suggests that a single process is generating these events. The task in the winlog is always \"File created\" with a specific rule mentioned.\n\nThe file paths are uniform except for the varying parts after \"excel-copilot-strings_\". These seem to be different file hashes or identifiers, like GUIDs or some other unique strings. Each event creates a new file at this path.\n\nNow, considering what's normal in system logs: legitimate processes create files all the time. SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar—I think it's related to Microsoft Office, possibly part of the Office Solution Packages. So, these events might be standard operations performed by Office during updates or package installations.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many similar events? Each one is a file creation, but with different filenames in the same directory. If this is happening multiple times within a short period, it could indicate that something's being unpacked or cached. Is this part of a normal update process, or could it be malicious?\n\nI should check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known for creating many files quickly. Looking up, I find that SDXHelper is related to the Office Add-ins and Solution Packages. It's used to manage add-ons and customize Office applications. During updates or installations, it's common for such processes to create multiple configuration or resource files.\n\nThe file paths lead into the \"OfflineFiles\" directory under a specific package GUID. This suggests that these are cached resources for an Office add-in, possibly Copilot-related features. So, if this process is running as part of a legitimate update or installation, these events are normal.\n\nHowever, another angle: could these file creations be indicators of something malicious? For example, if an unknown process creates many files quickly, it might suggest data exfiltration or malware dropping components. But in this case, the process name and paths align with known Microsoft structures, which reduces the suspicion.\n\nI should also consider the frequency. There are 14 events here, each creating a different JavaScript file. If these were created over a short period, say within minutes, it might be suspicious. However, without timestamp data, it's hard to gauge how quickly these files were created. But given that they're all in an Office-related directory, it's more likely part of the update process.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes legitimate processes can exhibit behaviors that look suspicious because of their volume. For example, if a script is iterating and creating many small files, it could be seen as malicious activity. But again, without additional context like timestamps or other event types (e.g., deletion after creation), it's hard to tell.\n\nI should also think about the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\". Is this process known for handling multiple file creations? From what I know, yes—when Office updates or installs new add-ins, SDXHelper is involved in extracting and caching these resources. So each of these events could be part of that standard procedure.\n\nLooking at the file paths again: they all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData...\", which is a user-specific directory. This isn't unusual for per-user application data. The fact that each path has a unique GUID suggests it's a specific instance or package being handled, which aligns with how Office manages add-ins and packages.\n\nSo putting it all together: the process name is legitimate, the task is file creation, and the paths point to standard locations within the Office structure. While 14 events in one batch seem like a lot, without more context on timing or other indicators of compromise, I'm leaning towards these being normal operations.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events are likely part of legitimate Office updates or cache activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions by SDXHelper.exe in a standard Microsoft Office directory, which is likely related to legitimate package installations or updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

That's a red flag because some malware or suspicious activities often come from known processes. But wait, SDXHelper sounds familiar—is it a legitimate Microsoft process? I think so; it might be related to Office's solution packages. So maybe this is normal behavior.\n\nLooking deeper at the events, each one is a \"File created\" event in Windows logs. The file paths are all within the user's AppData Local folder under Microsoft Office's Solution Packages. These seem like they're part of Office add-ins or perhaps Copilot-related files. The filenames have hashes and version numbers, which suggests they're resources for specific features.\n\nI also notice that multiple events create the same files. For example, \"excel-copilot-strings_68fa3d8d421a10183f19db8ce5721015.js\" is created twice. This duplication makes me think these are cache or temporary files being generated during normal operation—maybe Office is updating or installing new features.\n\nAnother point: all events share the same file paths, except for a few variations in the package GUIDs and filenames. It's consistent across different files but doesn't show any unusual patterns like access to restricted areas or repeated failed attempts that might indicate brute force attacks.\n\nI wonder if there are other indicators of malicious activity here. The process is known, the actions are file creations in expected locations, and nothing seems out of place in terms of permissions or access times. If this were a breach, I'd expect more varied events across different systems or processes, not just repeated writes from one source.\n\nConsidering confidence, it's low because everything points to legitimate Office operations.

Let's break down what each event looks like.\n\nEach line has three main components: process, winlog, and file. The process name is consistently \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's a red flag for me because I know that many malware or suspicious processes often have names that mimic legitimate software but with slight variations. But SDXHelper sounds familiar; maybe it's related to system tools or office add-ins.\n\nThe winlog task is always \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means each event indicates a file was created. That in itself isn't malicious, as many applications create temporary files or cache data regularly.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to the same directory structure under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\... and then into OfflineFiles. The filenames are variations of \"excel-copilot-strings\" with different hashes appended. This suggests that multiple files related to Excel's Copilot feature are being created.\n\nWait, the fact that the same process is creating multiple files in a loop might be something to look at. If an application is legitimately generating cache or temporary files, it would typically do so once per needed file, not repeatedly for many similar ones unless there's a bug or intended behavior.\n\nI'm also considering whether this activity aligns with normal user behavior. Office applications often download and cache resources when they're used, especially with features like Copilot. So, the creation of these files could be part of that process.\n\nHowever, since all events are from the same process name and involve creating files in a specific pattern, I wonder if this is part of some persistence mechanism or an attempt to bypass detection by scattering multiple small files. Sometimes, attackers create numerous files as part of data exfiltration or to avoid being noticed.\n\nAnother angle is to check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. Maybe it's related to Office add-ins or system tools. If I recall correctly, Microsoft Office uses similar naming conventions for their helper processes, so this could just be normal operation.\n\nBut the repetition stands out. Why are there multiple files with different hashes? Perhaps each represents a different string resource being loaded. Alternatively, it might indicate that the process is generating these files rapidly, which could be indicative of something more nefarious, like a script or tool dropping multiple files quickly.\n\nI should also think about the timestamp of these events. If they're all within a short timeframe, that would raise suspicion because legitimate processes don't usually create many files in quick succession unless under heavy use.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it seems to be part of normal Office operation.

The process name is consistently \"SDXHelper.exe\", which suggests it's the same application creating these files. \n\nThe task in each event is \"File created\" with the rule being FileCreate. That makes me think it's just logging file creation events. The file paths are all within the same directory structure under \"AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\", which points to some kind of Office-related package.\n\nLooking at the file names, they're all variations of \"excel-copilot-strings\" followed by different hash-like strings. This pattern suggests that each file is a new version or update being downloaded and saved. The repetition of creating these files—each event is identical except for the filename suffix—indicates it's part of an installation or update process.\n\nI know that during software updates, especially with things like Office add-ins or Copilot features, applications often download multiple resources. These might be JavaScript files required for the Copilot functionality. The fact that each file has a unique hash suggests they're different versions or specific chunks being downloaded.\n\nThe user is \"fiddelis\", but since all events are from the same user and same process, it's likely just their system running updates or downloading necessary components. There's no indication of unusual behavior here, like files being created in unexpected locations or by unknown processes.\n\nConsidering that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known component related to Microsoft Office, specifically handling package resources, this activity should be normal during an update or installation phase. No signs of malicious intent, such as file creation times spread out over unusual intervals or attempts to access restricted areas are present.\n\nI'm also thinking about how often these events occur. There are multiple entries with the same process and task, which aligns with a typical update process where several files need to be created or written. If this were an attack, I'd expect more varied processes or irregular activities across different parts of the system.\n\nIn summary, each event is part of a legitimate file creation process by a known Microsoft Office helper application. The repetition and structure of the events fit well within normal software update behavior, so there's no cause for concern here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events from SDXHelper.exe related to Excel Copilot strings in a standard location.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

So, the user has given me a batch of JSONL events, each representing a file creation event by SDXHelper.exe in specific locations under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory.\n\nFirst, I notice that all these entries are from the same process name, which is SDXHelper.exe. That makes sense if it's part of a legitimate software like Excel or an add-in because such processes often create files during their operation.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the \"OfflineFiles\" folder inside the PackageResources directory. The filenames follow a pattern with prefixes like \"excel-copilot-strings\" and various hexadecimal strings, which suggests these are resource files possibly related to an Office add-in or feature like Copilot. These kinds of files are usually created when installing or updating such software.\n\nI see that each event is identical except for the filename part; each file has a unique name but follows the same structure. The fact that they're all created by the same process and in the same directory makes me think this is part of a normal installation, update, or runtime process for an Office application or its add-ins.\n\nNow, considering potential malicious behavior: file creation events can be suspicious if they occur in unexpected locations or involve unknown processes. However, SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar as it's often associated with legitimate Microsoft tools like the Windows Defender Exploit Protection (DEP) system or similar security features. Plus, the path being under Microsoft Office packages further supports this.\n\nThere's a repetition of events, but in this case, multiple file creations in the same directory by an expected process are typically part of normal operations. Unless there's something unusual about these files, like them being executed or having unexpected content, which isn't indicated here.\n\nAnother angle is whether these files could be indicators of compromise (IoCs). The filenames don't seem to align with known malicious patterns or hash values I'm aware of. Legitimate software updates often create multiple small files in such structured directories.\n\nConsidering the timestamps might help, but since they're not provided, it's hard to tell if the file creations are happening at an unusual frequency beyond what's normal for Office operations.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to be cautious, especially when dealing with cybersecurity, the information at hand doesn't raise any red flags.

Then there's a winlog indicating that a file was created (rule: FileCreate). The files all have very similar paths but different filenames.\n\nHmm, I know that Office applications sometimes use temporary or cache files, especially for features like AI Copilot. These might be legitimate entries as part of normal operation. The fact that the same process is creating multiple files with slightly different names suggests it's part of a package or bundle being loaded into memory. \n\nBut wait, why are there duplicate events? Each file path ends with a hash-like string, maybe indicating different versions or parts of the same resource. It could be that these are resources for the AI Copilot feature in Office, which might require several files to load.\n\nI'm trying to think if SDXHelper.exe is known for anything malicious. From what I recall, it's related to Microsoft Office, possibly part of the setup or update process. So repeated file creations by this process could be normal during an update or while accessing certain features that require multiple resources.\n\nHowever, seeing so many identical events might raise a flag because it's unusual for a legitimate process to create files in such a repetitive manner unless it's part of a specific feature. On the other hand, since all these files are under the Microsoft Office directory, it's more likely that this is expected behavior.\n\nBut then again, sometimes attackers use legitimate processes for malicious activities. Could this be an indicator of something else? Maybe not directly. The file paths point to specific resources, and they don't seem suspicious in their naming or location beyond the typical cache files.\n\nSo considering all these points: same process creating multiple similar files under a known Microsoft directory, which is likely related to Office features. It doesn't look malicious at first glance, but it's somewhat unusual because of the repetitive nature and number of events. \n\nI think the confidence level would be moderate.

This repetition makes me think these are incremental file creations.\n\nNow, considering that SDXHelper.exe is mentioned in each event, I should check what this process typically does. From my knowledge, SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Office's Solution Package Manager. It's used for managing and updating add-ins or customizations within Office applications.

That's a red flag because it suggests that one program or process is responsible for all these events. Now, what does SDXHelper do? From what I recall, it's often related to software like Microsoft Office, specifically handling things like offline files and updates. It might be part of the Office Solution Packages.\n\nNext, each event reports a \"File created\" task according to the winlog field. So, this process is creating files. The file paths all lead to the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\[some GUID]\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\.

The variation in the suffixes suggests different files being created each time. It's worth noting that JavaScript files are common in web-based content or for dynamic language use, which fits with Office components.\n\nNow, considering whether this is suspicious. If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, creating these files as part of normal operations wouldn't raise flags. However, since all events are identical except for the file names and they all come from the same process, it might look like unusual activity if we didn't know about this process's typical behavior.\n\nI should also think about how many such events would be expected under normal circumstances. If an Office update is happening or files are being synchronized offline, multiple file creation events make sense. On the other hand, malicious software often tries to stay under the radar and might not create so many similar events unless it's part of a legitimate process.\n\nAnother angle: the fact that each event is a separate JSON object but identical in structure except for the filename suggests they're all generated by the same action repeated multiple times.

So, I see a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event. Let me look at the structure.\n\nEach event has three main parts: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's the same across all events. The task in winlog is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means each event is about a file creation. \n\nNow, looking at the files being created, they're all under different paths within the user's AppData directory. Specifically, these are inside Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages and their OfflineFiles folders. The file names have long hashes in them, like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_d2a01ab8f8d7605cd831c73c13f130ca.js\" or similar.\n\nHmm, so the same process is creating multiple files with different hash-like filenames. I know that SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Office add-ins and updates. It's part of the Office update mechanism. So when it creates files, especially JavaScript files, it's probably just updating or caching some resources needed by Office features like Copilot.\n\nLooking at all these events, they're all the same type—file creation—and they’re happening in a legitimate area for Office-related files. There doesn’t seem to be any variation or signs of suspicious behavior here. No unusual file paths, no unexpected processes creating them, just normal updates or cache writes by a known Microsoft process.\n\nI don't see any indicators that these events are part of malicious activity. They look routine. So as a whole batch, they’re not particularly interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve the creation of files by SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office updates and caching. The file paths are within standard locations for such operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is something I should look into more deeply. So, I've got multiple JSONL entries here, each one representing an event on a system. Each event has the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task in each case is a file creation under the Windows log, and the files being created are all JavaScript files located within various offline package resources related to Microsoft Office's Solution Packages.\n\nFirst off, I recognize that SDXHelper.exe is often associated with Microsoft Office. It's part of their setup and configuration tools, especially for features like Copilot in Word or AI functionalities across Office applications. So, when this process creates files, it's typically normal as part of how Office updates or deploys new features.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within \"AppData\" which is a standard location for application data and cache. The specific sub-paths like \"Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\" suggest these are packages added to enhance Office functionality. Each file path ends with a .js extension, indicating JavaScript files, which makes sense because many web-based features in Office use JS.\n\nI notice that several of the events create duplicate files. For example, there are two entries creating \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_c62d76d06f0f547a17fe8ca50b485ab5.js\" and similar duplicates. This repetition isn't unusual because it's possible that the same file might be written multiple times as part of an update or cache refresh.\n\nAnother point is the consistency in the process name and task type—each event is a \"File created\" action by SDXHelper.exe. There’s no variation here, which suggests a routine operation rather than something malicious. If there were other types of log entries (like deletions or access attempts), that might raise more flags.\n\nConsidering the structure of these events, they all follow the same pattern, which aligns with how legitimate software updates work. Office applications often need to update their packages, and doing so involves creating new files in specific directories. The use of consistent naming conventions in the file paths (like \"min\" for minified JS files) further supports this as normal behavior.\n\nI also think about whether these files are known to be malicious. Since they're part of official Microsoft Office package resources, it's less likely unless there's a known vulnerability or specific update that's been exploited. However, without evidence of tampering or unusual access patterns, I don't see any immediate signs of compromise here.\n\nThe fact that all events are from the same process and follow the same pattern over multiple lines makes me lean towards this being non-malicious. If it were an attack, we might expect a mix of actions—like file creation followed by deletion or attempts to access restricted areas, which isn't present here.\n\nIn summary, these logs show consistent, repetitive file creation by a known Office-related process in standard locations. Without additional indicators of suspicious activity, I don’t see any red flags that would warrant further investigation beyond normal monitoring.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are legitimate file creation activities by the SDXHelper.exe process, which is associated with Microsoft Office updates and package installations.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that all the events are from the same process: \"SDXHelper.exe\". This suggests it's a single application or component generating these logs. The task in each event is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates that files are being created. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all located under the user's AppData directory within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. Specifically, the paths point to OfflineFiles folders containing .js files with various hashes as filenames. The naming pattern in the file paths is consistent across events, which makes me think these are part of a normal software operation.\n\nSince \"SDXHelper.exe\" is associated with Microsoft Office and the files being created are JavaScript resources for Office add-ins or Copilot features, this seems like legitimate activity. I know that Office often handles such files during updates or installations to provide offline access to necessary resources.\n\nNow, considering all events together: there are multiple instances of the same file creation actions. Each event is identical except for the specific .js filenames. This repetition doesn't raise any red flags because it's typical for applications to create several configuration or resource files when initializing or updating.\n\nI should also think about whether such activities are common and expected. In this case, they appear to be part of normal operations. There's no indication of unusual access times, multiple failed attempts, or other signs that could suggest malicious behavior.\n\nTherefore, while each event on its own might catch attention, the combination doesn't point towards anything suspicious. The consistent process name, task type, and file locations all align with standard operating procedures for Microsoft Office-related software.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal file creation activities by a legitimate Microsoft Office-associated process, SDXHelper.exe, creating JavaScript files in the expected location.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. So I'm looking at a batch of system log events where the same process, SDXHelper.exe, is creating files in specific paths each time. The file paths are under Office Solution Packages and have long GUID-like identifiers.\n\nFirst off, SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar—it might be related to Microsoft Office, possibly handling updates or package resources. The events all mention \"File created\" which is pretty standard for software operations.\n\nNow, the files being created seem to be JavaScript files, like \"word-copilot.min.js\" and others with similar names. These could be part of Office's Copilot feature, which relies on JavaScript for functionality. The paths under PackageResources\/OfflineFiles suggest these are cached or offline resources used by Office.\n\nThe repetition is interesting—each event is almost identical except for the file path. This makes me think it's part of a normal update or cache refresh process. Multiple files being created in quick succession might just be how Office handles resource loading during startup or updates.\n\nI'm also considering if this could be malicious. Malware often creates files, but usually in different locations or with less predictable naming conventions. These files are in a known Microsoft Office directory, which makes me lean towards it being legitimate. Plus, there's no indication of other suspicious activities like privilege escalation or unusual file permissions.\n\nAnother point is that each event involves the same process and task type. If this were part of an attack, I'd expect varied processes or different log types (like network connections or registry changes). The uniformity here points to a standard operation.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that repeated file creation could be indicative of something monitoring for persistence, but given the context and location, it's more likely related to Office functionality. Plus, there's no evidence in the event data of any anomalies like executable files being created or modified outside expected patterns.\n\nIn summary, while I'm cautious about multiple identical events, the consistent naming, file types, and locations suggest this is part of normal Microsoft Office operations rather than malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve the creation of files related to Microsoft Office Copilot resources by a legitimate process (SDXHelper.exe).
