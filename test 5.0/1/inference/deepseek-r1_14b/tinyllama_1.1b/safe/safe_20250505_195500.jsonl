Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in a specific path. Each file name has a different suffix but follows a similar pattern: \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_[hash].js\". This suggests they're part of an Office package resource being downloaded or updated. The fact that multiple .js files are created sequentially might indicate normal operation, like loading scripts for the AI Copilot feature in Office.\n\nThere's also one event from \"chrome.exe\" setting a registry value. That seems less concerning on its own, as browsers often interact with system settings, though it depends on the context.\n\nConsidering all events together, they don't show any signs of malicious activity. No unusual processes, failed logins, or access to sensitive areas. The repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe fit typical Office behavior.

That seems normal because svchost is a legitimate Windows process and BitsProxy is related to background intelligent transfer service, which handles file downloads.\n\nNext, I see several entries from SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office Solution Packages directory. The filenames are all variations of officeaicopilot-strings.min with different hashes. This looks like standard operation for Office add-ins or updates being installed. These aren't unusual since many applications create temporary or cache files during updates.\n\nThen there's chrome.exe loading BitsProxy.dll again, which is similar to the first event and likely benign.\n\nI also notice a security group management task, which is typical Windows activity related to user rights and permissions.\n\nLastly, winlogbeat.exe creating a config file is expected if it's an ELK stack component used for logging. The .winlogbeat.yml.new suggests it's setting up or updating its configuration.\n\nOverall, all these activities seem within normal operational parameters without any signs of malicious behavior.

The Excel.EXE events show opening a file, creating a temporary version, and then deleting it—this aligns with standard Excel operations when handling files.\n\nThe only thing that catches my eye is the creation of multiple JavaScript files in the Office package resources by SDXHelper.exe. While this could be part of legitimate updates or feature deployments, the frequency might warrant closer inspection to ensure none are malicious scripts being injected.\n\nOverall, while there's nothing overtly suspicious, the repeated file creations and deletions, especially involving non-standard paths, do raise some curiosity.

These are common system files, so nothing suspicious there. There's also a file stream creation for an Excel temp file, which makes sense as Excel processes data.\n\nThen there are multiple FileCreate events from SDXHelper.exe. The paths point to JavaScript files in the Office Solution Packages directory. This seems related to Office add-ins or custom solutions. Since these are user-specific and part of standard Office operations, it's normal for such files to be created during setup or updates.\n\nI also see several Registry value sets from both EXCEL.EXE and Explorer.exe. These could be configuration changes, which are typical for applications accessing or modifying system settings.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the repeated FileCreate events by SDXHelper.exe with identical file paths.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so bear with me.\n\nFirst, the user has provided a batch of system log events in JSONL format. Each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. My task is to analyze all these events together and determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation.\n\nLooking at each event, they all have similar structures. The main components are \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". \n\nThe process name in most events is \"SDXHelper.exe\". There's one event where the process is \"chrome.exe\". \n\nIn the winlog section, all tasks are labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates that a file was created. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within the same directory structure under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages with varying package resources and offline files, except for one event where the path is in Downloads.\n\nThe filenames after \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" have different suffixes, which seem to be unique identifiers. Some of these are repeated, like \"92489fdab8f868e2a5235f3c97a46cb4.js\" appearing twice.\n\nNow, considering what I know: SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Office, specifically managing Solution Packages for add-ins and customizations. It's a legitimate process. The repeated file creation events with similar names but different hashes might be part of how the software handles resources or updates.\n\nThe event with chrome.exe creating a temporary file in Downloads seems normal too—maybe just downloading something.\n\nPotential red flags: \n\n- The same process (SDXHelper.exe) creating many files quickly could indicate something malicious, like dropping multiple files as part of an attack. However, given that these are under the standard Microsoft Office directory and named with specific patterns, it's more likely legitimate.\n  \n- The repeated file names but different hashes might be a sign, but without knowing what those files contain, it's hard to say. If these were malicious scripts, there could be multiple instances, but again, since they're in an expected location, this is probably normal.\n\n- Another thing is the number of events—14 in total. That seems high for legitimate activity from a single process unless the system is under heavy use or updates are happening. But considering it's all within Office packages, maybe it's part of an update process.\n\nI also need to think about confidence levels. If I were more experienced, I might recognize that these file creations are part of normal operations, especially for Office add-ins which often have resource files with such naming conventions.\n\nSo, putting it together: All events seem related to legitimate processes within Microsoft Office and Chrome. There's no indication of unusual behavior or signs of malicious activity across the batch. The repetition is explainable as part of standard operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are all file creation activities by a legitimate Microsoft Office process, with repeated but normal patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events provided in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event, and I need to analyze the entire batch as a whole to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, let me parse each event to understand what's happening. The first thing I notice is that many of these events are generated by \"SDXHelper.exe\". This process is creating files, specifically JavaScript files, in a path related to Microsoft Office's Solution Packages and OfflineFiles. The file paths all end with various hash-like strings, like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_bcde561ecb8a682661d626d5bf33668b.js\". \n\nI see multiple instances of the same process creating files with different names. For example, the first event creates a file ending with \"...bcde561ecb8a6826...\", and another one ends with \"...c085e2192b79296f...\". There are several such events, all from SDXHelper.exe.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event from \"chrome.exe\" setting a registry value. That seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the Windows Registry for configuration settings. Then there are more file creation events from SDXHelper.exe, each creating another JavaScript file in the same directory structure.\n\nNear the end, there are two events from chrome.exe: one loading urlmon.dll and another loading MpClient.dll. These seem like standard system files; urlmon is a common DLL for URL mapping in Windows, and MpClient might be related to anti-malware or system protection.\n\nNow, considering all these events together, I need to determine if they're indicative of malicious behavior or something normal. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office's setup package. It's responsible for managing updates and solution packages. The creation of multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory suggests that this process is probably downloading or extracting some resources needed by Office features, like AI Copilot mentioned in the filenames.\n\nThe repetition of file creations with different hash-like names could indicate that these are temporary files being downloaded or cached. It's not unusual for applications to create multiple small files during updates or cache downloads. The fact that all these events come from a single process (SDXHelper.exe) further supports the idea that this is part of legitimate Office operations.\n\nThe two events from chrome.exe are also within normal bounds. Chrome often loads various system DLLs, and setting registry values can be part of its configuration process. These don't raise any red flags.\n\nI should consider if there's anything unusual about these activities. For instance, a sudden spike in file creation events from an unfamiliar process could indicate malicious activity. However, since this is a known Microsoft process (SDXHelper.exe), and the files are being created in expected locations related to Office resources, it doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the timestamps of these events (though not provided here) would help determine if the activity is happening over an unusual time period. If all these file creations happened within a very short timeframe, that might warrant further investigation. But without that information, I have to assume they're part of a normal update or cache refresh.\n\nThere's also no indication of failed operations, access to restricted resources, or other signs of malicious behavior like privilege escalation attempts. The events are all straightforward file creations and registry modifications, which align with the expected behavior of legitimate software updates.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to monitor such activities, there doesn't seem to be any evidence of malicious intent in this batch of events. They appear to be normal operations conducted by known system processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to legitimate file creation and registry activity by Microsoft Office components, which is expected during updates or cache management.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break down each event.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is \"EXCEL.EXE\" and the task is \"Registry value set\". That seems a bit unusual because Excel typically doesn't modify registry values frequently unless it's part of its standard operation. I should check if this activity is normal for Excel or if it could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nNext, there are events from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating several files in different locations under the Office SolutionPackages directory. The file paths look like they're related to language-specific resources and JavaScript files. SDXHelper is an Office add-in helper, so it's legitimate for it to create these files as part of its operation.\n\nHowever, the number of registry modifications by Excel stands out. Nine events of setting registry values might be a red flag. Such repeated writes could be part of malicious activity, like installing a backdoor or ensuring persistence across reboots.\n\nConsidering all events together, while most are normal operations (like file creation by SDXHelper), the multiple registry changes by Excel merit closer examination.

The file paths are pointing to various language-specific strings and icons under the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory. These look like legitimate resources for different languages, so it's probably normal behavior when Office is updating or initializing its localized assets.\n\nThen, there are events from \"svchost.exe\" and \"EXCEL.EXE\". Svchost is a common system process that hosts services, so registry modifications by it aren't unusual. EXCEL.EXE being involved in registry changes makes sense too since Excel might be interacting with system settings or add-ins.\n\nI also notice that there are multiple entries from the same processes creating similar files and modifying the registry.

This process seems to be creating multiple files in different locations. The paths point to various language-specific strings files under the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory. For example, there are entries like \"es-mx-ui-strings-json\" and \"fr-fr-ui-strings-json\", which suggests these are localized resource files for different regions.\n\nThe fact that all these files are being created by the same process makes me think it's part of a legitimate update or installation routine. Microsoft Office often handles such updates, especially if they're dealing with language packs or UI localization files. The repetitive pattern in the file paths and names also supports this idea—each event is similar but for different languages.\n\nI should check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known to be a legitimate process. A quick search tells me it's related to Microsoft Dynamics, which makes sense as part of an office suite update.
