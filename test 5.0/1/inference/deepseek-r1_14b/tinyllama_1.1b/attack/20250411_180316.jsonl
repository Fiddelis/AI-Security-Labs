Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of powershell.exe processes running with specific command lines. The command lines all have similar structures: checking if certain files exist and exiting based on that. This seems suspicious because attackers often use Powershell for executing scripts or lateral movement within a network.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the winlog field, there are several 'Registry value set' events. That's concerning because changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to maintain access after reboots.\n\nThere are also multiple 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET framework DLLs and Windows Defender files. While these might seem normal, frequent loading of these modules could indicate unusual activity or attempts to disguise malicious actions as legitimate processes.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation followed immediately by deletion in the user's temp directory. This behavior is often seen in malware trying to erase evidence of their presence on the system.\n\nMoreover, multiple 'RegistryEvent' tasks are logged from chrome.exe, which seems out of place since Chrome typically doesn't interact with the registry that way unless it's being used maliciously or compromised.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of Powershell activity with these specific command lines, registry modifications, and unusual file operations suggests potential malicious behavior.

This immediately raises my suspicion because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The fact that there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being launched suggests possible automation or script execution, which could be part of normal operations but also potentially suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines in several events, I see commands like \"New-Item\" and \"Set-Content\". These cmdlets are commonly used to create and modify files. The paths they're interacting with, such as creating .bat files in various directories (e.g., C:\\pacote_logico\\modulo_principal..), seem to be attempting to write scripts to disk. This behavior could indicate the creation of malicious scripts or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where files are being deleted, specifically \"File Delete logged\". The path mentioned is a temporary file related to PSScriptPolicyTest, which might suggest that some script execution was attempted and then cleaned up. File deletions can be signs of attempts to cover tracks, making this event more concerning.\n\nThe logs also show multiple image loads from .NET framework components (like mscoreei.dll, clrjit.dll), which is normal for PowerShell but could indicate the loading of malicious libraries if these were tampered with or used inappropriately. Furthermore, registry modifications are logged, which can be a red flag as attackers often use registry changes to maintain persistence.\n\nTaking all these events together, it seems like there's a pattern of file creation, modification, and deletion activities that could be indicative of script-based attacks. The repeated use of PowerShell with specific commands targeting various directories is concerning, especially since such actions don't appear to serve a clear legitimate purpose in the context provided.\n\nWhile some of these activities could be part of normal system administration or software updates, the combination—especially the file creation and deletion, along with multiple registry writes—is more aligned with malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch does warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes creating and modifying files across different directories, including suspicious script creations and deletions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be abused for malicious activities. The repeated use might raise some flags, especially when combined with other actions like registry modifications and file creations.\n\nLooking at the events, `powershell.exe` is involved in several tasks:\n1. **Registry value set**: This could be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations.\n2. **Image loaded**: Loading DLLs might indicate the use of additional modules or malicious scripts.\n3. **File created**: Creating temporary files like `__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1` is suspicious. Temporary PowerShell scripts are often used in attacks to test policies or execute commands without being detected easily.\n\nThere's also an event where `whoami.exe` was executed. While this tool itself isn't malicious, it's often used by attackers to gather information about the system, such as checking user privileges or hostname. The combination of using `whoami` along with other PowerShell activities could be a sign of reconnaissance or lateral movement.\n\nAnother point is the use of `cmd.exe`. It's being used to set registry values, which again can be part of persistence mechanisms but isn't inherently malicious unless it's done in a way that's out of normal user behavior. The fact that both cmd and PowerShell are involved might indicate more complex scripting or an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nAdditionally, there are events from `winlogbeat.exe`, which is likely related to log management. It created a configuration file, which seems benign but could also be part of an attacker's tools if they're setting up their own logging to monitor the system.\n\nI'm considering whether these activities indicate normal user behavior or signs of an attack. The repeated use of PowerShell with various tasks and the creation of temporary files make me lean towards this being potentially malicious. However, without more context on what's considered normal for this particular system, it's hard to be certain.\n\nThe confidence level is moderate because while there are red flags, such as multiple registry changes and file creations by PowerShell, they could also be part of legitimate scripts or automated processes.

The user is a cybersecurity expert looking to analyze system logs for malicious behavior. They provided a batch of events in JSONL format and want a single classification as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\".\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. Most of them involve powershell.exe, which is commonly used by attackers but can also be legitimate. The events include file creations, deletions, and checks using Test-Path in the command line.\n\nI notice several instances where powershell.exe runs scripts with paths like C:\\modulo_geral\\...\\. These look like they're checking for specific files or paths. This could indicate a script is verifying its presence on the system, possibly to ensure it can execute without issues. The repeated use of Test-Path might be part of an installation routine or a malicious payload checking if certain components are in place.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1 was deleted. Script policy test files are often created by PowerShell to check execution policies. Deleting them could mean the script is trying to bypass restrictions or remove evidence of its activity.\n\nLooking at the other events, like winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file and whoami.exe running without any anomalies, they don't raise red flags on their own but context matters.\n\nConsidering all these together, the repeated powershell.exe activities with specific paths, the script deletion, and multiple Test-Path checks suggest potential malicious behavior. However, it's not conclusive as some of these could be legitimate scripts or system operations. The confidence level is around 0.65 because while there are signs, they might not be enough to confirm an attack without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe with command lines that appear to test file paths and delete temporary PowerShell script files.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. Each object has three keys: process, winlog, and file. I need to look at all of them together because sometimes malicious activities involve multiple events across different processes or files.\n\nLooking at the first event: It's calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal because those are standard Windows executables. But wait, calc.exe is usually benign, but sometimes attackers can abuse it. However, without more context, I'm not sure yet.\n\nThe second event is notepad.exe setting a registry value. Notepad is a common tool, and modifying the registry isn't suspicious on its own unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nThird, Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again. Same as calc.exe but different name. Maybe a typo or different process? I'll note that.\n\nFourth event: svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svchost is known for running various services, so this could be normal unless it's doing something unusual.\n\nFifth: Calculator.exe setting another registry value. So now Calculator has two events—loading a DLL and modifying the registry. That might be worth looking into more.\n\nSixth event: powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is powerful but often used by attackers for scripting. This could be legitimate admin work or malicious activity, so it's a red flag.\n\nSeventh: whoami.exe running with its command line. Whoami is usually used to get user info; not inherently bad, but again, part of the puzzle.\n\nEighth: chrome.exe creating a pipe. Chrome often does inter-process communication, so that's probably normal.\n\nNinth: WMIC.exe loading urlmon.dll. WMIC can be used for remote commands and has been involved in attacks before. This might be suspicious on its own, especially combined with other events.\n\nTenth to twelfth: chrome.exe setting registry values again. Multiple instances of Chrome doing this could indicate something fishy, like a malicious extension or script.\n\nThirteenth: whoami.exe again with the same command line. Maybe legitimate use, but repetition could be part of an attack sequence.\n\nFourteenth event: cmd.exe being used to copy files. The command is copying sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. That's interesting because sethc.exe is a system file that can be involved in privilege escalation attacks if replaced with malicious code. This might be a key indicator of compromise (IOC) because attackers often replace these files.\n\nFifteenth: schtasks.exe deleting a task. SCHTASKS is used for scheduling tasks, and deleting one could be part of covering tracks or disrupting system monitoring.\n\nSixteenth to twentieth: More cmd.exe events setting registry values, whoami.exe runs, and powershell.exe accesses processes. The repetition here with other potentially malicious activities like file copying and task deletion raises the suspicion level.\n\nPutting it all together, I notice multiple instances where legitimate tools are being used in ways that could be malicious. Specifically, the use of powershell.exe, cmd.exe to copy system files, schtasks.exe to delete tasks, and the repeated registry modifications across different processes might indicate a coordinated attack. These activities can be part of an attacker's toolkit for persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.\n\nThe confidence level is high because several events point towards potential malicious behavior, especially the file replacement with cmd.exe, which is a known technique in cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple potentially suspicious activities detected across processes and registry modifications, including the use of powershell.exe, whoami.exe, schtasks.exe for task deletion, and cmd.exe to copy system files which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of PowerShell processes being created. That's a common tactic for attackers since PowerShell is powerful and often used in malicious activities. Each event shows that powershell.exe is starting with specific command lines. These commands are checking the existence of certain files in various paths, like \"C:\\entrada_auxiliar\\pacote_ativo\\entrada_ativo\\bin\\tarefa_temporario.exe\". The fact that they're using if statements to check for file presence might be part of a script to ensure malicious files exist or to drop them if they don't. That seems suspicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances where files are being created and deleted in the Temp directory. For example, \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1\" is created and then possibly deleted. This could be an attempt to bypass PowerShell's script execution policy by creating a temporary script file, running it, and then deleting evidence.\n\nLooking at the Registry events, powershell.exe is setting values in the registry. Malware often uses registry modifications to maintain persistence or change system configurations without being detected easily.\n\nThere are also cmd.exe processes running commands like checking for \"objeto_logico.txt\" in the Temp directory. This could be part of a larger script to check if previous steps were successful, possibly indicating a multi-stage attack where components are verifying each other's presence.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe is another red flag. While legitimate uses exist, it's commonly used by attackers to gather information about the current user, which can help in privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple PowerShell instances with command-line arguments checking for files, creating\/deleting temp files, registry modifications, and use of cmd.exe and whoami.exe. This combination suggests a potential malicious script or tool trying to establish persistence, drop files, or execute commands without being detected.\n\nHowever, each individual event might not be enough on its own, but together they form a pattern that's concerning. It's possible this is part of an attack chain where the batch represents several stages of an intruder's activities. The confidence level is high because multiple indicators point towards potentially malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with command lines checking for file existence, creation\/deletion in Temp directory, registry modifications, and use of whoami.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events are related to powershell.exe. That immediately raises a flag because PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously. Malicious actors often use it due to its powerful scripting capabilities and built-in persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the events, there are several instances where powershell.exe is executing scripts. For example, the command line arguments in some events show paths like \"C:\\modulo_secundario\\pacote_padrao...\" which don't look like standard system directories. These might be custom scripts or modules being checked for existence before exiting with 0 or 1. This behavior could be part of a script testing phase, potentially indicating that the attacker is checking if certain files exist on the system.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe loads various .dll files and interacts with the registry. The loading ofclr.dll and clrjit.dll might be normal for .NET processes, but combined with other activities, it could be suspicious. Additionally, the registry value set operations might indicate an attempt to create or modify registry keys for persistence or configuration.\n\nAnother point is the file creation and deletion events in the AppData folder under fiddelis' profile. Creating a script like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1\" temporarily suggests that the process is trying to execute some policy tests or scripts, which could be indicative of attempting to bypass certain security policies or testing if malicious scripts can run.\n\nThe repeated use of 'ProcessAccess', 'ImageLoaded', and 'RegistryEvent' tasks in the events indicates a process that's accessing system resources and modifying the environment. This kind of activity is often seen during an attack chain, especially during the execution and persistence phases.\n\nConsidering all these together, it seems like the batch shows a pattern consistent with malicious behavior: checking for specific files (possibly to ensure they can be executed without issues), registry modifications (for persistence or configuration), and temporary file creation\/deletion (to avoid detection). These activities are not typical of legitimate PowerShell usage and could be part of an attack.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this as INTERESTING with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts, checking file existence, loading unusual modules, and interacting with the registry suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe. The command lines look like they're checking for the existence of certain .ps1 files. For example, one checks \"C:\\registro_base\\entrada_base\\objeto_principal\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". This seems suspicious because it's verifying if a script exists and exiting with 0 or 1 based on that check. The same pattern repeats with different paths like \"C:\\tarefa_temporario...\" and \"C:\\unidade_logico...\". This repeated checking might indicate that the script is trying to ensure it hasn't been removed or modified, which could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where a file was created: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1\" in the Temp directory. Then, shortly after, this same file is deleted. Creating and then deleting temporary files can be part of an attempt to avoid detection or to clean up evidence of malicious activity.\n\nOther events include loading various DLLs by powershell.exe, which might be normal, but combined with the other activities could raise flags. There's also a registry value being set by both powershell.exe and notepad.exe, which again, if done in conjunction with other suspicious actions, could indicate something is amiss.\n\nThere are network connection events from svchost.exe and chrome.exe. While these might seem normal, considering the elevated activity from powershell.exe, it's worth noting that malware often uses legitimate processes like svchost or browser processes for its activities.\n\nOverall, while some of these actions on their own could be benign, the combination—especially the repeated checks for specific scripts, creation and deletion of temp files, multiple process accesses, and network connections—strongly suggests potential malicious behavior. This batch is definitely worth investigating further to check if it's part of a larger attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events checking for script existence, creating temporary files which are later deleted, and network connections suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few logs, they're all from chrome.exe with network connection tasks. That seems normal because browsers do connect to networks. But then I notice some powershell.exe entries. Powershell can be tricky because it's a powerful tool that can be used for both good and bad purposes.\n\nThe next set of events show powershell.exe being created with specific command lines like \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\". These commands are often used to list files in directories, which isn't inherently malicious. But the fact that it's recursing through directories might be a sign of something more, especially if it's done without user interaction.\n\nThere are also registry value sets by powershell.exe. That could indicate configuration changes, but again, not necessarily suspicious unless they're modifying known bad locations or creating new keys in unexpected places.\n\nThen there are file operations: creating and deleting files in temporary directories. The path mentioned is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1. Creating a temp script file might be part of normal operations, but deleting it quickly could suggest an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nLooking at the image loads for powershell.exe, they're loading various DLLs which is standard for scripts running in memory. However, one of them is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which is unusual because defender shouldn't need powershell to load that unless something's off.\n\nThere are pipe creations and provider lifecycles being logged. These could be communication methods between processes, but again, not sure if they're malicious on their own.\n\nThe last few logs seem unrelated, like file creation by winlogbeat.exe for its configuration file. That doesn't raise any flags.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell instances with specific command lines, creating and deleting files in temp directories, and modifying the registry. These actions could be part of legitimate script execution but also could indicate malicious activity like persistence or data exfiltration. The repeated attempts to create and delete files might be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because while individual events aren't suspicious, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior that needs closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell instances with potentially malicious command lines and file operations in temporary directories, suggesting possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

That seems suspicious because using PowerShell with such commands can be a sign of reconnaissance, maybe trying to list files recursively across directories. But sometimes legitimate scripts do this too.\n\nSecond event: The process is conhost.exe, which usually runs as part of Windows Command Prompt or other shells. It's doing a registry value set. Not immediately alarming, but paired with other events, it might be relevant.\n\nThird event: Again, powershell.exe creates a file at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\estrutura_secundario.txt'. Creating files can be part of data exfiltration or log gathering. The filename looks suspicious, maybe trying to create a secondary structure or list.\n\nFourth event: Another powershell.exe accessing something via ProcessAccess. This could be checking for other processes running, possibly to kill them or get their handles, which is a common step in malicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple events with powershell.exe doing file operations and process access, along with conhost.exe making registry changes.
