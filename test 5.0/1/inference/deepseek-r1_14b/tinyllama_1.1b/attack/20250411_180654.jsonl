{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two events here. The first event shows that svchost.exe created a file named keyValueLKG.dat in the NetworkService profile directory. Svchost.exe is a common system process used by various Windows services, and sometimes malware can misuse legitimate processes like svchost to hide malicious activities. The path mentioned, C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData..., seems legitimate as that's where NetworkService might store data. However, the filename keyValueLKG.dat doesn't ring any immediate bells, but I should consider whether this file is part of normal system operations or if it's suspicious.\n\nNext, the second event involves powershell.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads folder named pacote_temporario.txt. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by administrators for legitimate scripting but is also commonly exploited by attackers for command-line execution and lateral movement. The filename translates to \"temporary package\" in Portuguese, which might indicate that it's part of some automated script or download process. But given the context, I have to assess if this activity is out of the ordinary.\n\nNow, considering both events together: one from a system service and another from a user process. The combination might not immediately suggest malicious behavior since each event on its own isn't highly suspicious. However, powershell.exe is a red flag because it's often used in attacks. If this was a single event, I'd be more cautious, but paired with the svchost.exe activity, which could be part of normal system operations or something else, it's worth looking into.\n\nI should also think about how these events correlate. For instance, if both processes were to create files in unexpected locations or at unusual times, that might raise suspicion. Alternatively, if powershell was used without user interaction, that could indicate unauthorized access. But based on the given data, I don't have enough context about timestamps, user activity, or other related events.\n\nGiven all this, my confidence level is moderate. The events individually aren't conclusive, but together they might warrant further investigation to ensure there's no underlying malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes file creation events by processes that could be indicative of potential malicious activity, such as powershell.exe which is often used in attacks. The combination may warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously. The command lines show several calls to Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts with different paths. These scripts are likely designed to log keystrokes, which is a classic sign of keylogging malware. The repeated use of these scripts across various directories suggests an attempt to evade detection by using multiple locations.\n\nNext, there are events where powershell.exe accesses registry values and loads images. Registry modifications can indicate persistence mechanisms, allowing the script to run on startup. Image loading might be part of how the malicious code is executed or how it interacts with legitimate processes.\n\nOne event shows a file deletion related to a PSScriptPolicy test file. This could mean that the script is attempting to remove evidence or disable certain security policies temporarily to avoid detection while running.\n\nThere are also entries where conhost.exe and svchost.exe interact with registry keys and files. These processes can be legitimate but sometimes used by malware to hide their activities. For example, svchost.exe is commonly associated with services, so unexpected file creation might indicate malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there's a process named winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. This could be related to log management tools, but since the logs are being analyzed, it's worth noting if this is part of normal operations or if it's being used to manipulate logs.\n\nThe presence of multiple script paths pointing to Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different directories (e.g.,modulo_ativo, registro_ativo, etc.) suggests a pattern. This distribution might be an attempt to spread the malicious activity across various locations, possibly to avoid single-point detection mechanisms or to make removal harder.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the repeated powershell.exe command lines running keylogging scripts, multiple registry accesses, file deletions, and the use of legitimate processes for malicious tasks—it's clear that this batch shows signs of potentially malicious behavior. The combination of these activities indicates a possible attack involving persistence, data collection (keylogging), and attempts to cover tracks.\n\nTherefore, the batch is classified as INTERESTING with high confidence due to the suspicious patterns and indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes executing Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts across different paths suggest potential malicious activity, likely keylogging. The batch shows repeated attempts to run these scripts, possibly indicating persistence or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
