First, I notice that a lot of the events are from powershell.exe and services.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities because it has strong scripting capabilities. The fact that it's being used multiple times could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the specific actions, there are several ImageLoad events in powershell.exe. This usually happens when PowerShell loads modules or scripts. But I see some unusual file paths here. For example, one of them is creating a file in C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a random-looking name __PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1. That seems suspicious because it's a temporary directory and the filename looks like it might be part of some script testing or perhaps an attempt to execute malicious code.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Registry value sets from services.exe and svchost.exe. These processes often handle system services, but writing to the registry repeatedly can indicate tampering with system configurations, which is a common tactic in malware to maintain persistence or alter security settings.\n\nI also notice that there's an attempt to load mscoree.dll and similar .NET framework components. Malware sometimes uses legitimate tools and libraries to hide their activities. The combination of loading these modules and creating temporary files makes me think that this could be part of a larger script or payload execution.\n\nAnother point is the FileCreate event by powershell.exe in the AppData folder, which is a common location for user-specific data but can also be used maliciously to store or execute scripts. Additionally, there are multiple RegistryEvent entries from different processes, which might indicate an attempt to modify system settings across various services, possibly to establish persistence.\n\nPutting it all together, while not all these activities are necessarily malicious on their own, the pattern—especially the use of powershell.exe with file creation and registry modifications—raises concerns. It's possible that this batch could be related to a script testing phase or an attempt to drop malware components on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes loading various DLLs, creating temporary files, and modifying registry values.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a Windows system. My job is to analyze all these together and decide if they merit investigation.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I notice that svchost.exe is creating files in various paths like AppReadiness and Temp directories. Svchost is a common process, often part of legitimate services, but sometimes it's used by malware. However, each event here just mentions file creation; nothing immediately suspicious jumps out.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating a pipe. Pipes can be normal for communication between processes, so I don't think that's a red flag yet. But I'll keep an eye on what else happens with that process.\n\nNext, powershell.exe comes into play multiple times. It starts loading various DLLs and creates some files in the Temp directory. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but also abused by attackers for scripting malicious activities. The command line in one of the events catches my attention: it's executing a script with Get-Item on $env:WinDir + '\\\\inf\\\\*.inf' and checking for specific patterns. That seems like it could be scanning system files, maybe looking for something malicious or trying to elevate privileges.\n\nWait, but why would a legitimate script scan INF files? I'm not sure. Some scripts might do that for configuration purposes, but without more context, this behavior raises an eyebrow. Also, the fact that it's using -ExecutionPolicy Restricted suggests that it's trying to run under strict policies, which can be a sign of attempting to avoid detection or running malicious code.\n\nLooking through all the events, I see multiple file creations by svchost.exe and powershell.exe. The combination of file operations in sensitive directories (like AppReadiness) and the use of PowerShell for potentially scanning system files could indicate something's off. However, without additional indicators like failed attempts, unusual network traffic, or known malicious file hashes, it's hard to be certain.\n\nOn the other hand, these events might just be normal system activity. Svchost.exe is part of the Windows Service Host process and often creates temporary files. Similarly, PowerShell scripts are common in enterprise environments for administration tasks. The script in question seems to check INF files, which are typically used by hardware drivers or installation packages.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because of the unusual combination: svchost.exe creating multiple files and powershell.exe running a script that scans system directories. While not conclusive on its own, it's worth investigating further to ensure there's no underlying malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by svchost.exe in sensitive directories and PowerShell executing a script that scans system files may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system log events. I'm looking for any signs that might indicate malicious behavior or something out of the ordinary that could warrant further investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from different processes: svchost.exe, setup.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and services.exe. These are all legitimate Windows processes, so at first glance, they seem benign. However, it's important to consider their activities in detail.\n\nLooking at the tasks logged:\n- **svchost.exe** is involved in \"Registry value set\" events. Since svchost.exe is a common process used by various system services, these registry operations could be normal as part of their operation.\n- **setup.exe** has multiple entries: creating files and registry values. It's known that setup.exe can be associated with software installations, so this might just be an update or new program being installed.\n- There are also some \"Pipe Created\" events from setup.exe. Named pipes are a legitimate inter-process communication mechanism in Windows, often used by legitimate applications.\n\nThe specific files created include:\n- notification_helper.exe and pwahelper.exe under the EdgeCore directory. These could be helper executables for Microsoft Edge, which might not be unusual during an update or installation.\n- msedge.exe is being written to the Application directory, again likely part of a standard update process.\n- The .tmp files in the Windows Temp directory might be related to extracting or installing software packages.\n\nI also see that some events don't reference specific files, which could be normal if the task doesn't involve file operations. Registry changes are common for configuration purposes, especially during installations.\n\nOne thing I'm considering is whether the frequency of these events stands out. There are several entries from setup.exe modifying registry values and creating pipes, which might indicate an ongoing process that's worth monitoring. However, without additional context like timestamps or more detailed information about each event, it's hard to say if this activity deviates significantly from normal behavior.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards classifying the batch as \"NOT INTERESTING.\" The activities seem consistent with legitimate processes performing standard operations during software installations or updates. However, there's a small element of uncertainty because multiple registry modifications and file creations could sometimes be red flags, but in this case, they don't appear异常.\n\nI should also consider if any events are anomalies. For example, svchost.exe creating files is less common since it typically doesn't handle file operations directly, but the files created are temporary and seem related to appx packages, which makes sense during an installation process.\n\nIn conclusion, while I'm cautious due to the volume of certain activities, there's no clear indication of malicious behavior. Therefore, the batch doesn't merit immediate investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, setup.exe) performing standard operations such as registry modifications and file creations, which are typical during software installations or updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. So, there are several JSON objects here, each representing an event. I need to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events involve processes named 'Dism.exe' and 'DismHost.exe'. These are related to DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management), which is a tool used for servicing Windows images. It's commonly used during installation and configuration of Windows, so seeing these processes running isn't unusual in itself.\n\nLooking at the event types, most events are either 'File Executable Detected' or 'Image loaded'. These log entries typically occur when a file is executed or when a DLL is loaded into memory. Given that DISM works with various system files and components, it's expected that it would be loading multiple DLLs during its operation.\n\nThe file paths mentioned all point to temporary directories under the user's AppData folder. The filenames like 'ImagingProvider.dll', 'OfflineSetupProvider.dll', etc., seem to be specific to the DISM process. These are likely legitimate components used by DISM for different functionalities, such as image operations or provider services.\n\nI don't see any signs of suspicious behavior here. There's no indication that these files are being executed from unexpected locations or that they're known malicious files. The consistent use of temporary paths and the involvement of standard system processes make me think this is normal activity related to Windows servicing or updates.\n\nAlso, considering that there are multiple entries loading different DLLs, it aligns with how DISM operates when preparing or applying updates. Each provider might be responsible for a specific aspect of the deployment process, which explains why they're all being loaded.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while each individual event might look notable at first glance, the combination here doesn't raise any red flags. It seems entirely within the bounds of legitimate system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate DISM processes loading standard provider DLLs from a temporary directory, indicating normal Windows servicing activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the provided batch of JSONL events is relevant for investigation. Let's look through each event.\n\nFirst, I notice that most events are from processes named 'DismHost.exe' and 'Dism.exe'. The tasks logged are either ImageLoad or FileDeleteDetected. The file paths all point to temporary directories under 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\' with various .dll and .mui files.\n\nI remember that Dism is related to Windows deployment, specifically DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management), which deals with image-based deployments. During such processes, it's normal for DISM-related executables to load images and delete temporary files after use. The temporary directory name '33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89' looks like a GUID, which is typical for temporary folders in Windows.\n\nLooking at the events:\n- The first three entries show DismHost.exe loading image files. This makes sense as part of the deployment process.\n- The remaining events are from Dism.exe deleting various files and their resource (.mui) files. These deletions are expected after processing to clean up temporary data.\n\nThere's no indication of unusual behavior, such as multiple failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or execution outside normal patterns. All actions align with standard DISM operations during a system image deployment or servicing.\n\nTherefore, the activities described don't raise any red flags related to malicious behavior. They appear to be legitimate and part of normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal Windows DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management) operations, specifically loading and cleaning up temporary files during an image-based deployment or servicing.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the command line is a PowerShell script. The first few lines all have similar commands: creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a specific binary path and starting it. This seems suspicious because creating services can be a way for malware to persist across reboots. However, each of these events has \"winlog\" task as either \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle.\" I'm not sure what those tasks mean exactly, but they don't seem alarming on their own.\n\nThen there are several entries where PowerShell is used with the -ExecutionPolicy Restricted flag. This restricts script execution, which might be a way to prevent certain actions—but sometimes attackers use it to limit detection. The command in these cases writes \"Final result: 1\" or similar messages. It's unclear if this is part of legitimate operations or malicious activity.\n\nAnother set of events uses PowerShell to check for specific patterns in INF files located in the Windows directory. This could be a way to check for installed drivers or components, but it might also be used by malware to identify certain system configurations.\n\nThere are multiple repeated commands across different lines. Repetition often suggests automation or script execution, which could be malicious if the script is harmful. The fact that the same command appears several times makes me more cautious.\n\nLooking at the file field, all events have \"None,\" which might mean no file was accessed or created during these events. That's a bit concerning because certain activities should involve accessing files, and none being logged could indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nThe last event has a null process but logs a \"Special Logon\" task. This could be related to user logon events, but without more context, it's hard to say if it's significant.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with specific commands and flags raises red flags. The creation of services and checking of system files can be indicators of malicious behavior. While some of these might be legitimate scripts or administrative tasks, the combination and repetition suggest potential threats. Therefore, I classify this batch as interesting because there's a high probability of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands, including service creation and file system checks, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I'm given a JSONL file with some log events, and I need to analyze the entire batch to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. The output should be a single JSON result with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nLooking at the example provided: each line has three fields - process, winlog, and file. For instance, one event is {\"process\":\"{'name': 'services.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Logon'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}. Another line seems to be missing some parts or maybe it's an incomplete log.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each field represents. The process field likely indicates which process was involved, winlog is probably related to Windows logs (maybe event types like Logon, Logoff, etc.), and the file field could show if a file was accessed or modified.\n\nIn the example, there's an event where 'services.exe' is running, and the task is 'Logon'. Services.exe is a common system process that handles services in Windows. The logon event could be a user logging in, which is normal. Since the file field is None, it doesn't indicate any file access.\n\nI should consider what makes a batch of logs interesting. If there are signs of malicious activities like multiple failed logins, processes accessing restricted files, or unusual times of activity, that would be concerning. But here, services.exe is a legitimate process, and the logon event is standard unless it's part of an unusual pattern.\n\nThe user mentioned that each line represents one JSON object, so I need to look at all lines together. If there are multiple such events without any anomalies, they might not be interesting. However, if combined with other suspicious activities, like failed logins or unexpected file accesses, it could be a red flag.\n\nWait, in the given example, the second line seems incomplete: {\"process\":\"{'name': 'msbuild.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"None\"}. The process is msbuild.exe, which can be legitimate but sometimes used by malware. However, without more context like what task it's performing or if it's accessing files, it's hard to say.\n\nI should think about the confidence level. If the batch has multiple events that are all normal, confidence in being \"NOT INTERESTING\" would be high. But if there's any event that raises a red flag, even with others being normal, the classification could shift towards interesting.\n\nIn this case, both processes seem legitimate, and without additional information like timestamps or other activities, I wouldn't see a clear indication of malicious behavior. So my initial thought is that this batch isn't particularly interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes (services.exe and msbuild.exe) with standard logon tasks, no evidence of suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze these logs related to a cybersecurity incident. There are several entries here that I need to unpack.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial entries where processes like \"cscript.exe\" and \"svchost.exe\" are being terminated by \"taskkill.exe\". That seems suspicious because legitimate scripts or services wouldn't typically be killed unless something is trying to stop them. Maybe a malicious process is terminating these to hide its tracks or prevent security tools from running.\n\nNext, there's an attempt to access the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) using \"wmic.exe\". WMI is often used by attackers for command and control or to gather system information. The fact that it's being executed with a long command line might indicate it's trying to retrieve detailed system info, which could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nI notice some entries about the Windows Task Scheduler (\"taskschd.exe\"). If an attacker gains access, they often use task scheduler to create persistent tasks so their malicious activities continue even after rebooting. The creation or modification of tasks here might be a red flag.\n\nThere's also mention of \"svchost.exe\" being executed with specific parameters. Since svchost is a legitimate Windows process, it can sometimes be abused by malware. Malware often creates new services that run under svchost to avoid detection, so this could indicate an infection trying to establish persistence.\n\nThe \"powershell.exe\" command caught my attention too. PowerShell is powerful and commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The command provided seems to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to a binary path that includes some specific directories like \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". I'm concerned this could be installing malware on the system, especially since it's using quotes and escaping characters which might hide malicious commands.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated entries of None for process, winlog, and file. These might indicate attempts to access logs or delete them to cover tracks, but without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe an attacker is trying to clear logs after some activity.\n\nI should also consider that these events happened within a short time frame (from 14:02:56 to 17:09:38), which could mean a coordinated attack where the attacker is dropping tools, establishing persistence, and covering their tracks quickly.\n\nTo sum up, I'm seeing signs of potential malware or unauthorized access. The use of taskkill, wmic, taskschd, svchost, and powershell with specific parameters all point towards possible malicious activity on the system.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs you provided indicate a sequence of events that could be indicative of malicious activity on a system. Here's an analysis of these logs:\n\n1. **Process Termination**:\n   - The log shows `cscript.exe` and `svchost.exe` being terminated by `taskkill.exe`. This might suggest that some processes were running and were forcefully stopped, possibly by another process or user.\n\n2. **WMI Activity**:\n   - There is an entry indicating activity related to the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) using `wmic.exe`. WMI is a built-in Windows feature used for system management and monitoring. However, unusual WMI activity can sometimes be a sign of malicious behavior, such as information gathering or remote control.\n\n3. **Task Scheduler Activity**:\n   - The log shows activity related to the Windows Task Scheduler (`taskschd.exe`). This might indicate that some tasks were either created, modified, or deleted. Malicious actors often use task scheduler to create persistent malware activities.\n\n4. **Svchost.exe Execution**:\n   - There is an entry showing `svchost.exe` being executed with specific parameters. `Svchost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process used by system services, but it can sometimes be misused by malicious actors to hide their activity or create persistence.\n\n5. **Powershell Activity**:\n   - The log shows a command executed in PowerShell (`powershell.exe`). The command appears to create a new service named `objeto_ativo` with the binary path pointing to a specific executable file. This could be an attempt to install malicious software on the system or gain persistence.\n\n6. **None Entries**:\n   - There are several entries where all fields (process, winlog, file) are marked as \"None.\" These might represent attempts to access logs or delete them, possibly to cover tracks after some activity.\n\n### Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):\n- The use of `taskkill.exe` to terminate processes.\n- Unusual WMI activity.\n- Task scheduler modifications.\n- Execution of `svchost.exe` with specific parameters.\n- PowerShell command execution creating a new service.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Investigate Process Termination**:\n   - Determine why `cscript.exe` and `svchost.exe` were terminated. Check if these processes were running legitimate tasks or if they were part of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Analyze WMI Activity**:\n   - Review the WMI query to understand what information was being collected. If it's not related to a known legitimate process, it might indicate reconnaissance by an attacker.\n\n3. **Examine Task Scheduler Entries**:\n   - Check if any new or modified tasks were created around the time of the incident. Look for tasks that might execute malicious code at startup or regular intervals.\n\n4. **Inspect Svchost.exe Activity**:\n   - Since `svchost.exe` is a legitimate process, ensure that no malicious services are registered under it. Use tools like Process Monitor to track its activity.\n\n5. **Review PowerShell Command**:\n   - The command creates a new service named `objeto_ativo`. Check if this service exists in the system and investigate its binary path (`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`). Ensure that this file is not malicious.\n\n6. **Check for Log Tampering**:\n   - The \"None\" entries might indicate attempts to clear logs. Review the integrity of your log files and ensure they are not being altered or deleted without proper authorization.\n\n7. **Network Monitoring**:\n   - Check if any suspicious network activity occurred around the time these events happened, such as data exfiltration or communication with known malicious domains\/IPs.\n\n8. **System Re-image or Quarantine**:\n   - Given the potential signs of compromise, consider quarantining the affected system and performing a clean reinstallation of the operating system to ensure all malware is removed.\n\n9. **Enable Additional Monitoring**:\n   - Temporarily enable additional logging tools or security solutions to monitor for any further suspicious activity on the system.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can better understand whether the system has been compromised and take appropriate actions to remediate the issue."}
