{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of the observed activities:\n\n1. **Initial Processes:**\n   - `explorer.exe`: The main Windows shell process.\n   - `svchost.exe`: A host process for Windows services.\n\n2. **Network Connection:**\n   - An outbound connection was made to a remote IP address (74.125.130.99), which belongs to Google's DNS servers, suggesting the system might be attempting to communicate with an external resource or resolve a domain name.\n\n3. **Potentially Malicious Activity:**\n   - A file named `entrada_principal.zip` was downloaded from an unknown URL (not provided in logs).\n   - The `whoami.exe` process was created, which is often used by attackers to determine the privileges of the current user.\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes (`powershell.exe`) were spawned:\n     - One of them executed a command to remove all files in the temporary directory with the pattern `*entrada_principal.zip`, suggesting an attempt to clean up traces.\n     - Another PowerShell process created and then deleted a file named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp folder. This could indicate the execution of a malicious script.\n   - Several DLL files were loaded into memory, including some from Microsoft.NET Framework and Windows Defender.\n\n4. **Other Notable Activities:**\n   - The system registry was accessed by a PowerShell process.\n   - Pipe(s) were created, which might indicate communication between processes or redirection of output\/input streams.\n\nGiven these activities, it's likely that the system is compromised or under attack by an unknown threat actor using techniques such as command and control (C2), data exfiltration, or lateral movement. It would be wise to investigate this further and take appropriate actions to mitigate any potential risks."}
