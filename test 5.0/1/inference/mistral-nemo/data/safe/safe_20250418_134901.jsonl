{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided JSON logs, here's a summary of the events that occurred:\n\n1. **Process Creation and File Operations:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` was created and attempted to create\/access a file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`.\n   - `setup.exe` created a temporary file at `C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp\\b8d633a2-08f3-4e51-85c3-3602fa580c63.tmp`.\n\n2. **Image Loading:**\n   - `sppsvc.exe` loaded `taskschd.dll`.\n   - `notepad.exe` loaded `urlmon.dll`.\n\n3. **Registry Events:**\n   - Several processes (including `svchost.exe`, `chrome.exe`, and `Calculator.exe`) performed various registry operations such as setting values, adding\/deleting objects.\n   - No specific registry keys or values are mentioned in the provided logs.\n\n4. **Dns Query:**\n   - `chrome.exe` performed a DNS query, although the details of the query (e.g., domain name) are not included in the log.\n\n5. **Other Events:**\n   - Some events occurred with no associated process or file information (`{\"process\":null,\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"None\"},\"file\":null}`).\n\nTo analyze these logs effectively:\n\n- Enable verbose logging to capture more detailed information about each event, such as specific registry keys\/values and DNS query details.\n- Consider using a security information and event management (SIEM) system or other advanced log analysis tools to correlate events across different categories.\n- Monitor for unusual patterns or behaviors that could indicate malicious activity. For example:\n  - Multiple files created\/deleted in a short period by the same process.\n  - Frequent registry modifications, especially if they involve suspicious keys\/values.\n  - Unexpected DNS queries, particularly those related to known malicious domains."}
