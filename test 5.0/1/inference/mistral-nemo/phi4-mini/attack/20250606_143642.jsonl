{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's what happened:\n\n1. **Initial PowerShell Process**\n   - A PowerShell process was created with the command: `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`\n   - This suggests that an initial script was run to set up or trigger further actions.\n\n2. **Subsequent PowerShell Processes**\n   - Several more PowerShell processes were created, each with the same command:\n     ```\n     powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command\n     $Res = 0;\n     $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\\\inf\\\\*.inf');\n     foreach ($Inf in $Infs) {\n         $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName;\n         if ($Data -match '\\\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\\\]') {\n             $Res = 1;\n             break;\n         }\n     }\n     Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;\n     ```\n   - This script searches for `.inf` files in the Windows directory, checks if they contain the string `\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\\\]`, and outputs the final result.\n\n3. **Winlog Tasks**\n   - The winlog tasks \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" appear repeatedly, indicating that these events were triggered multiple times during this activity.\n\nBased on the commands run and the repeated nature of the PowerShell processes, it's likely that the script was designed to check for something specific in `.inf` files. Since `$Res = 1; break;` is used when a match is found, it seems they were looking for those specific strings in any `.inf` file.\n\nHowever, without more context or additional logs, we can't determine why this script was run repeatedly or what the intended purpose was. It could be related to software installation checks, but without further information, it's difficult to say definitively."}
