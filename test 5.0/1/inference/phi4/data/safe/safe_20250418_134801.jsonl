This is common in environments where version control systems are used.\n\n2. **File Paths**: The files being created are within a typical directory structure for Node.js projects (`node_modules`), which indicates that these events likely relate to package management or installation activities, such as installing npm packages. \n\n3. **Files Created**: The files include common types like `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `package.json`, and various source files (`.js`, `.ts`). These are standard files associated with Node.js packages.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**: Since all entries involve file creation activities for a development tool (`git.exe`) within a development context, there is no indication of malicious behavior or anomalies. The activity aligns with expected operations during software development and maintenance.\n\nThe high confidence level reflects the clear alignment between the observed activities and typical, non-malicious software development processes."}
