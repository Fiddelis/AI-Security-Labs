Multiple file creation events are recorded under this process in directories related to Microsoft Solitaire Collection, suggesting potential misuse or exploitation of a trusted application. Additionally, the presence of DNS queries initiated by Solitaire.exe could indicate communication with malicious servers. The repeated 'winlogbeat.exe' creating the same file path suggests either misconfiguration or an attempt to persist data stealthily. Registry modifications by RuntimeBroker.exe add to the concern, as this process is often leveraged in elevation of privilege attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
