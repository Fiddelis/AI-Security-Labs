{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch indicates multiple uses of PowerShell to create scheduled tasks with high privileges, which could be indicative of an attempt to maintain persistence on the system.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **High Privilege Usage**: The repeated use of `New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal` with the group ID `\"BUILTIN\\\\Administrators\"` and run level `\"Highest\"` suggests that tasks are being set up to execute with elevated privileges, which is a common tactic for maintaining persistence or executing malicious code.\n\n2. **Scheduled Tasks Creation**: Multiple entries show PowerShell commands used to create scheduled tasks that trigger at logon. This behavior could be indicative of an attacker trying to ensure their script runs whenever the user logs in, thereby establishing persistence.\n\n3. **Frequent Use of Powershell.exe**: The frequent occurrence of `powershell.exe` in various actions (like setting registry values and accessing processes) is noteworthy, especially given that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities. \n\n4. **Registry Modifications**: Several events show modifications to the registry (`'task': 'Registry value set'`). Registry changes are often associated with malware attempting to alter system configurations or hide its presence.\n\n5. **Potential Indicators of Persistence**: The combination of creating scheduled tasks, modifying registry values, and using PowerShell suggests an attempt to establish persistence on the system. These actions collectively raise red flags for potential malicious activity.\n\nThe confidence level is high but not absolute (0.9) due to the lack of direct evidence of malicious payloads or explicit commands typically associated with known malware. However, given the context and patterns observed in the log entries, further investigation is warranted."}
