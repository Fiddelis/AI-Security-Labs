Additionally, there are numerous registry events set by 'svchost.exe', a common host process for Windows services that attackers often impersonate for persistence. This combination of scheduled task creation and registry manipulation is characteristic of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity or malware trying to establish persistence on the system.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
