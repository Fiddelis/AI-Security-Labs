This activity is atypical for the Solitaire process.\n  \n- **File Paths and Patterns**: Files are being created within paths that include terms like \"advertisement\" and DLC-related folders. The creation pattern suggests potential data exfiltration or unauthorized modification.\n\n- **Potential Exploitation**: If `Solitaire.exe` has been compromised, it could be used to write malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript files) that execute unwanted actions when the Solitaire application is launched.\n\n- **Dns Query Event**: There's also a DNS query event linked with `Solitaire.exe`, which raises further suspicion about possible communication with external servers, potentially for command and control purposes or data exfiltration.\n\nOverall, these indicators suggest anomalous behavior that warrants investigation. The confidence level reflects the likelihood of this being an issue based on typical patterns observed in compromised systems."}
