{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The log snippet you've provided details a series of actions primarily associated with the `powershell.exe` process on a Windows system. Here's an analysis of what is occurring based on the available information:\n\n1. **Process and File Access**:\n   - The `whoami.exe` command is executed, which typically checks for the current user identity.\n   - A PowerShell script is created at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`, indicating some form of automated or scripted activity.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - The `powershell.exe` process accesses and executes commands from the temporary file created.\n   - There are multiple Image Load events, suggesting that PowerShell is loading various DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) needed to execute complex scripts. This includes .NET framework assemblies like `mscorlib`, `System.Management.Automation`, as well as Windows Defender components (`MpOAV.dll`).\n\n3. **Security Relevance**:\n   - The repeated access to `powershell.exe` and the loading of various system libraries may suggest a script is executing, potentially for legitimate purposes or malicious activity.\n   - The deletion of `entrada_principal.zip` from the temp directory further supports that scripts are performing cleanup operations post-execution.\n\n4. **Possible Malicious Activity**:\n   - If this PowerShell execution was unauthorized, it could be indicative of malware trying to execute commands or scripts without user knowledge. Such actions can lead to privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.\n   - The specific nature of the script content is unknown from the logs alone but warrants investigation.\n\n5. **Recommended Actions**:\n   - Investigate the source and purpose of `entrada_principal.zip` to understand what was being executed.\n   - Review any associated scripts for potentially harmful operations.\n   - Check for unauthorized changes in user policies or scheduled tasks that might trigger such scripts.\n   - Consider running an antivirus scan to detect possible malware.\n   - Monitor system behavior for any unusual network connections, file modifications, or other suspicious activities.\n\nThis log analysis suggests a need for further investigation, particularly into the origins and purposes of the executed PowerShell script. Ensure proper security protocols are in place to prevent unauthorized access and execution of scripts on your systems."}
