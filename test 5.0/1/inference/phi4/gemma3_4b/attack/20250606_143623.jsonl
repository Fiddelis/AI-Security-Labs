{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The logs provided represent various Windows event records involving PowerShell execution, service creation, and system activities. Here's a breakdown of the key points from these logs:\n\n### Process Execution\n- **PowerShell Commands:** Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` being used to create and start a new service named `\"objeto_ativo\"` using an executable at `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n  - These commands are encapsulated within PowerShell blocks, indicating script execution.\n- **Execution Policy:** Some entries specify the use of `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`, which is a security setting in PowerShell that limits script execution capabilities.\n\n### Service Management\n- **Service Creation and Start:** The logs indicate creating a service named `\"objeto_ativo\"` using `New-Service` cmdlet followed by starting it with `Start-Service`. This suggests an intent to run a specific task or application as a service.\n  \n### Registry Activity\n- A log entry mentions the `Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)`, indicating changes were made to the Windows registry, likely related to configuring system settings or software behavior.\n\n### System Events and Updates\n- **Windows Update Agent:** An event is logged for the Windows Update agent, suggesting that updates are being managed or applied on the system.\n- **Generic Service Activity:** There's a mention of `svchost.exe`, which is a generic host process name used by the operating system to run services.\n\n### Lifecycle Events\n- **Provider and Engine Lifecycle:** These logs likely represent internal events related to lifecycle management of components within a software or service framework, indicating initialization, configuration, or termination activities.\n  \n### File Activity\n- The \"file\" field consistently shows `\"None\"`, meaning no specific file operations are logged in these entries, such as creation, modification, or deletion.\n\nOverall, the logs depict typical activities around script execution, service management, and system updates within a Windows environment. The use of PowerShell for creating services suggests an automated setup process for running certain tasks or applications consistently with system startup. Additionally, lifecycle events may be tied to software components that manage these scripts or services internally."}
